Location L’eclerc car hire carcassonne ABOID,"Rented 4 cars from car hire in L’eclerc supermarket. Avoid - the cars are not well maintained and dirty. Then they try to blame each renter for damage that pre existed and fine you for not cleaning to their standards (which change each time). My car was returned cleaner than when I collected but after leaving the rental an “extra” cleaning charge was taken. Pre existing damage that was hidden (internal) and not visible is then charged, despite photo evidence. They may be cheap but seem to have a policy of making up the rent charged by fines and charges for damage that are not evidenced. It’s a battle each time I’ve rented - they are rude and do not listen, despite having a signed return report confirming no damage they are now trying to charge for “damage” post rental. Avoid them / the hassle is too much!",1
Disappointed,"It was a Poor experience. Please don’t create to much expectation, otherwise you will get disappointed. I think it’s to much expensive for the quality they present
.",2
Organization needs a lot of people at the same time inside,"Immaculate photographs very well accomplished. Congratulations to the artists.
Small space for so many people at the same time, a real disaster, should have entry quotas at the same time I could not appreciate the experience as I should.
I do not recommend visiting because it is not a large space. More control is needed on the number of simultaneous attendances.",1
Not satisfied,"Poor tower. We had asked to do a tower of 1h yet towards the end he did a tower of 1h30 without us wanting it and asked us 135€ instead of 90€. This is not a serious service and I do not advise everyone, it is a tourist catch.",1
Terrible experience,"We took a ride from this tuk tuk operator from about half km from Lisbon City side of Belem Castle to Chiado about a 15 min trip. 3 people in our party on Sun 23rd at 5pm.
It wasn't a sightseeing tour just a taxi style trip snd we were told this was no problem. We asked the price before getting in and were told 15 euro. We specifically asked the guy who was coordinator of the tuk tuks at the stand was this for the trip or per head. We were told in no uncertain terms it was just 15 e for the trip. When we reached our accomodation the driver was paid 15 e whereupon he said "" no it was15 e per person"" we argued politely this was not the case and there had been no language barrier when negotiations were done prior to getting in. He was persistent and we ended up parting with 40.00 euro in total 5 e less than he wanted. I looked up advice re this form of transport after the incident and read that a tuk tuk should never cost more than a taxi ride. (We had got a taxi from airport a days earlier for 20 euro for a 20 min ride for 3. So this is the case) so it left us with a bad feeling and totallly disgusted at being taken in like this.
Lisbon is a beautiful welcoming city and the people are lovely. But this company shouldn't be in buisness if thus is how they operate by scamming visitors. I see they have 5 * reviews here but this was NOT our experience. Guys out to make a quick buck. Shameful. It was NOT our mistake , just taken advantage of.",1
An unhappy experience,"The escorted sightseeing portion of the tour is fine. The Fado Dinner is not escorted and not suitable for anyone who is uncomfortable eating alone, or does not like loud and sometimes discordant music, or has dietary restrictions. You will not get your money’s worth and it will be a wasted evening.",2
Cancel and do not refund,I bought the credit card tour to Sintra. It was cancelled because they didn't add up to enough people. They never refunded my money.,1
"No info, anti tourist attitude, despite being a """"museum""""","No information about how to access,, we tried to enter and were told we have to book an appointment, but not shown how to book,, everything in Portuguese and staff was not helpful at all. There is no one inside and we still cannot gain access. Absolutely ridiculous.
Anti tourist establishment, despite being a museum. Dumbfounded.",1
"Good music, bad food and very expensive.","The live music was very good, however, the food was very expensive and of very poor quality in terms of its preparation. The green broth was the only saving grace, the salad, bland and soulless, the cod, dry. In short, I would not repeat.",2
we will not return,"Fado very good, but the food and service bad.
Very expensive for what it offers.
The product is very normal and not well prepared at all.
They offer a vegetarian menu (which would be nice if it were vegan) which also leaves something to be desired for the price.
Only the fado is good, as a restaurant, terrible.",2
Not recommended,"Not very warm welcome. The Fado performance was too short. The menu is limited and should be translated into French. The dishes are expensive and 3 curls of ice cream thrown into a bowl for €15 is excessive. The cod was as tasteless as the cake. Apart from the beautiful tablecloths and the (few) songs, this establishment is not worth the detour.",2
Terrible,"Reservation for 9.45 am. Menu delivered at 10.30 am. Customers gave up.
Lisbon has better, Casa Machado does not recommend it (even with a reservation)",1
Waiting on the plane without notice,"Departure was over 3 hours late, arrival after 2 hours and 50 minutes, so no claim for compensation was possible. Because of the delay, we missed the train connection and had to stay in an expensive hotel, but that doesn't matter to Ryanair.",2
"Paco, el estafador asturiano.","Paco el estafador sigue haciendo de las suyas, a nosotros nos encontró hablando español en la cámara de comercio, junto a la playita, en Lisboa... no sabíamos nada y después de más de una hora y para quitarnos de encima le dimos 50 €.",2
Great disappointment,"Unfortunately, we missed the fact that the Mega Parkour is only from 12. The Pequena Floresta is just disappointing. Even for our 8-year-old daughter no challenge. In addition, this short round may only be completed twice. We were through twice after 20 minutes. For children who are under 12 and have climbed before are definitely not a good choice. Better go somewhere else.",1
Experience did not deliver as advertised!!!,"This tour started off well. Naky was communicative, on time, and he had microphones for everyone. There was a large group of beautiful black people eager for knowledge. But unfortunately, the tour didn’t deliver what was promised. In the first 2 hours, we moved 2 blocks. We stood for 20 minutes in the first stop as he explained the symbols on the bank. We stood in the 2nd place for 30 minutes where he read the declaration of the Catholic Church. We walked across the street to the black owned bar and there he held up pictures of modern day black people who were somehow connected to Portugal. He gave very little factual information and it was mostly his ideological opinions. And it was pricey. The tour was 40euros each, the African dinner another 40, which is extremely overpriced in Portugal and then there was an expectation of everyone ordering from the bar. Overall, it felt more like a scam of black Americans who are eager for knowledge about the African diaspora.",1
nul,non mais c est du foutage de gueule une queue pas possible dehors puis la queue à l intérieur pour voir quoi 2 pièces de 20m2 franchement ne perdez pas votre temps vu extérieure c est suffisant,1
Not worth the money or time.,We pre-booked a ticket for the tower but still had to queue. We walked up to three different levels and each time had to stand around and wait for ages for people to come down the stairs in an empty room to then move up again. No boards with history/information to keep you interested. On the first level there was a balcony although there were so many people it was horrible. There was no access to the roof so when we got to the third level (empty room) we just had to wait to then go back down again. Possibly the worst attraction we have visited. Just appreciate it from the outside!!,1
A total waste of time,There is nothing beautiful to be seen inside apart from the terrace at the first floor. Then you will wait 15 to go up each floor and visit empty rooms. Then 15 more mins to go down. Definitely not worth the price of the ticket (6€ in feb 2023),1
Ah Amália experience,"The price list information is incomplete. It has a discount for family of 3, but doesn’t specify that one of the person has to have under 17 years old. The staff was very unpleasant. The exhibition was cool but very expensive.",1
As this in the title I was approached in the telegram to come just see this page,"They use bots to have visibility approached in Telegram to come see this page, in exchange pay 10 euros a shame until asks to be good the site but if it is someone from here using ""bots"" I do not recommend",1
Policia waiting for you,"We are in Lisbon by car since we have been visiting the country for more than a week. Our welcome to Lisbon was a police man waiting for us at the begging of a road where only public transport can go, but GPS usually doesn’t say it. We did 10 mt on the taxi lane and he was waiting for transgressors to give a ticket of 60 Euros with no allowances. It took one hour and a half! Rules are rules, but street signals were poor and police stays there to make money. If they were there to direct the traffic properly, they would have stopped 10 mt before inviting foreign cars to take the right way. Such a poor and disappointing welcome for tourists.",2
Save your time and energy to visit more interesting places in the city,"We liked this area of the city the least. Dirty, hot, up and down hills, steps, stuffy, unsafe and really nothing to see. It’s difficult to get there by public transport, we took an Uber, the driver dropped us off somewhere below and said - I can’t go any further, and we have to walk 10 minutes uphill. Plus, the owner of one of the cafes practically refused us a cup of coffee, saying that we had to order food in order to receive a cup of coffee as a reward at the end.

The only nice place was Miradouro de Sao Jorge, but do you really need to torture yourself just because of a visit this viewpoint, there are other observation platforms in the city. My husband and I often travel to European cities and have seen many ""old towns"", but Alfama is the most terrible and dirty area of all the ""old towns"" and inconvenient in every way for tourists. Our only desire was to get out of there as quickly as possible",2
"No Wow Factor, Dirty and Nothing Special","Hmm - definitely not what we expected; a maze of cobbled, slippery streets, the same boring shops and the odd decent hostelry.

Santa Luzia Viewpoint is a tourist trap nightmare - rammed with tuk-tuks and cabs.

Really would give it all a miss; there are better cities.",2
Alfama Lisbon district,"Bewilderment! That's saying little, we've never seen such a dirty neighborhood, you lazarones
Clean, how do you pretend nothing happened, there really is everything between these streets even in more places human excrement
What a bunch of uncivilized",1
No thanks!,"Alfama is a district in Lisbon with alleyways and cobbled streets and lots of steps and hills and it was like a maze, once your in it it’s hard to find your way back out and although I’m sure it would be beautiful during the day and there were aspects that were beautiful like the panoramic views at dusk but we went out later and it was more scary and intimidating than anything else and we couldn’t find a taxi so felt stranded and far from our hotel and the locals were not very helpful or friendly so we didn’t have the best experience to be honest. I would choose to spend more time in barrio alto than Alfama but that’s just me!",2
Don’t waste your time in Lisbon,"Surprisingly boring… attractions not worth the extremely hilly walk… it’s run down but not in a cute quaint way. Other then looking at a few buildings it is defo not worth coming too. Food is same old same old… nothing super tasty. Once you have see the view that’s it. Google it… what you see is all there is too see 😭. We stayed in the Evolution hotel near Cascais… much better spot, hotel was amazing. It was warmer than expected which was great. The local beach was lovely. Portugal is great for a couple weekend away but there are so many better places in the world. We were sadly underwhelmed. If you love graffiti back ya bags, you’ll love it 🫣 oh and people are super lovely and it feels very safe here.",1
did not impress,"The area is famous for the fact that it is the only one that survived the earthquake in Lisbon, but there is nothing special to see there (except to walk through it to the Castle of St. George), we liked walking in the center of Lisbon much more...",2
Dirty,"Very dirty, they offer you drugs everywhere, people smoking joint next to you at the Santa Lucia viewpoint to take a photo. I don't know how it can have such good comments...",1
Agradable pero muy ruidoso.,"Agradable y extremadamente ruidoso. Nos quedamos en un apartamento Airbnb con mi esposo y todos los días sin excepción había fiesta hasta más allá de la 1am. Si te gusta el ruido y la fiesta todo el tiempo lo recomiendo si quieres descansar no lo recomiendo. Por otro lado es pintoresco y antiguo, algunas zonas deterioradas y sucias otras en mejor estado.",2
"Alfama, not all that.","Most of the buildings are run down and in need of repair, signage and maps are few and far between, the streets are cobbled which is quaint, but the streets are dirty. It's great to have historic areas where people live, but if you want tourists to spend money there, they need to be attractive. Lisbon is run down, and it's a real shame. Lots of steep climbs.",2
Dirty area,"This looks like an awesome district but the area is filthy. Although last nite was Saturday party nite we cruise through the area after noon and I was personally disgusted with the filth. I took a few pick but it was way worse. Broke bottles, cig butts and lots of trash. Maybe after Sunday they clean up. Shame on the litterbugs too!",2
Overrated,"Old and kinda interesting, but this part of town is way overrated. There are nicer places to see in Lisbon.",2
déçu,"très deçu du quartier alfama qui je trouve à perdu de son charme.
beaucoup de sdf, d'attrapes touristes",2
Beware in hot weather!!!!,"It was hot outside, 37 degrees C. The Airconditioning barely worked and everyone inside the train suffered. The staff didnt give a sh. They were hanging out in the only cooled room, the Snack Shop within the train. No cold drinks for free to lower the suffering. Eveyone had to buy water. We bought and drank 5 bottles during the 4 hours between Porto and Lisbon. Especially older people had a very hard time. To make it even worse, we arrived one hour late... only travel with this train, if the temperatures are below 30 C, its dangerous.",1
Train pictures are fake. Use Daytrip private transfer,"Train was scarily dirty for a Business Class ticket I don't even know where to start. I thought since I bought business Class, the section will be cleaned and nice like on the pictures. The pictures are no where the real thing. Upon arrival at Lisbon Train station, you'll be a bit lost as you've no idea where's the train, upstairs or downstairs with no clear sign. The place looks dirty and old. The lift which looks like WWII is broken so you've to use the escalator. When we board the train which has the similar boarding time on our tickets, I'm shocked at the condition of the train from the outside. It was so scruffy with windows that have collected dust and stains for years. Completely different from the pictures that are advertised.

When we reach the First Class section, the seats my god, you can see the stains clearly on the cushion, like someone has took a dump before. I wish I'd some cloth or linen to put on top before seating down. It was the most uncomfortable 3hr ride from Lisbon to Algarve. Upon reaching Tunes, the lift took a long time and is structure such a way you've to take 2 times to reach the other side if you've heavy luggage.

I booked my tickets from Tunes to Porto and canceled it the moment I reach hotel in Algarve. I booked a DAYTRIP private transfer, it takes about the same amount of time (shorter) and way way more comfortable and clean. Door to door.",1
Disappointing Experience,"Not at all as expected compared to other high speed rail.
We had 1st class round trip tickets from Lisbon to Porto.
In both directions the toilets were broken. The doors were jammed and did not lock as well, and the toilets were backed up and didn’t flush. The seats were ok but not as spacious as some described.
When we traveled on the Italian Frecciarossa we showed our ticket to the agent near the train and he said, “You are here in first class”. He then took our bags and brought them into the train. There were no workers on the train except for a ticket agent and a beverage cart.
It seems that the train rarely get serviced.

The ride is not and smooth and quiet as the Frecciarossa and the Ice train.

Pros: It was on time and didn’t get lost. ☺️",2
Depeche mode night,"We are in Lisbon to attend the Depeche Mode concert which is our second concert of the European tour, with the first in May last year at the Ziggo dome in Amsterdam. The band were brilliant on both occasions but the Lisbon arena is a very poor venue. We had golden circle tickets same as Amsterdam but a totally different experience, too many fans packed in the space and the bar area totally disorganised only the one bar with two serving areas , they only sold 1/2 pint beers and small glasses of wine , in the uk arenas and in Amsterdam the bar areas are multiple and well organised? To be honest the acoustics in Lisbon were good but the overall fan experience very poor, we will definitely revisit the Ziggo dome in Amsterdam but never this arena in Lisbon",2
Pausini in Concert -,"Our first time visiting this arena to see Laura Pausini. We had the balcony area tickets. The seating was a challenge, it was very tight and hard seat. If you have problems sitting for a long time, you will definitely not like this. For being a modern arena, we thought the seating would be comfortable, and for the price$$.
So beware of the seats, if you have knee and back problems, it will definitely not be a pleasant event for you.",2
Room too big for this show... only with binoculars,"I went to see Ovo by Cirque do Soleil with my family. The 1 star is not for the show, which I practically didn't see, but rather for the blind greed of the organization. My tickets (€55 each) didn't allow me to see the artists bigger than ants (the fact that it was an insect show isn't a joke). It is a show with choreography, fine movements and facial expressions, which requires close proximity to be seen and appreciated. My children weren't interested. Our tickets were about 80-90m from the stage... the photo was taken from my seat 😕 To see it with binoculars, it's better (and cheaper) to watch it on television.",1
Madonna.,"We saw Madonna. 250eu a ticket. Left half way thru, terrible acoustics. Hardly heard her voice due to over load bass which echo'd around stadium, waste of money.",1
To avoid,"No interest, sad and empty mall even on a Friday evening. The shops are the same as in France, the products seem to be of lower quality. Prices are more expensive than in France",2
Terrible,Beautiful new store! But there is no men's session! That's terrible! Do you think there is an audience??? Where is the inclusion????? Please think more,1
1980's architecture,The huge building looks like a remnant of popular US television series from the 1980's. Impressive in style it is though outdated with a labyrinthic and dark interior. A large Aschan supermarket seemed to be the main attraction.,2
Don't go,"The Thai massage itself was well executed, but the overall experience was extremely disappointing due to the environment and serious concerns about professionalism.

The place is far from welcoming: there’s a strong, persistent smell of mold, with visible spots on the ceiling. It’s supposed to be a relaxing setting, but instead you’re in a closed, poorly ventilated space that feels uncomfortable and even unsafe.

Privacy is also lacking: the massages are done in open ""boxes"" inside a huge, dark garage, with background music playing like in a supermarket. The atmosphere is cold, impersonal, and very far from what you expect in a proper wellness center.

Most importantly — and this is a serious issue — the therapist touched my chest without informing me or asking for consent. Regardless of cultural norms, this kind of gesture should never happen without explicit permission, especially in a European context. It could be extremely upsetting for many people.

What’s even more concerning is that I noticed several previous reviews mentioning the same issues, particularly about the mold and poor conditions — which means the management has been aware for a long time and hasn’t taken action.

In short: while the massage technique itself was okay, the overall conditions are unacceptable. I would strongly advise against going unless these serious problems are addressed.",1
Permanentemente FECHADO,This place has been closed for over two years. It’s a shame as it was the first shopping center in Lisboa. All stores have moved or CLOSED.,1
小心带狗乞讨的,这条街很热闹，一开始我们还很沉浸在热闹的氛围中很开心，但是直到我看见有带狗乞讨的流浪汉在打狗，那只狗很怕这个流浪汉，一直想离开，所以被打的很厉害。我养狗了很多年，我能看出来那只狗在求助，请大家关注这种情况！,1
Luckily included in the Lisboa Card,Yet another panoramic point in Lisbon. It's a shame that you have to pay €4.50 to access it. It's just not worth it. Without paying you can admire Lisbon from other panoramic points.,1
Lisboa card advantages/disadvantages,"Usually a City cards worth their values because you can combine transports with museums free entrance.Lisboa card is different,transports are covered that's fine however not the main museums or castle(sao Jorge) are covered by Lisboa card.So Lisboa card is good just for the transport?it depends,I mean if you stay 4 days Lisboa card is €48,daily ticket transport is €6,80 so for 4 days total €28 ish. Disappointed also about poor discounts Lisboa card offers for some monuments,i.e. Museo do Carmo ticket price is €5,90 with Lisboa card is €5... ridiculous!Museo Fado almost the same.So I recommend to manage your trip find two or three mains things to visit paying and buy a daily ticket transport.Furthermore I would suggest Lisboa tourism organisation to improve the Lisboa card, because comparing with others European City card, isn't worth at all and is a pity because the city is beautiful, stunning and would deserve to be visited without thinking about the prices.",2
Veja primeiro se acha que vale a pena ir!,"A exposição Sintra Mitos e Lendas na sua origem contava com imagens 3D e aparelhos do tipo telemóvel ligadas a auriculares para se ouvirem os vários temas. Veio o COVID 19 e acabou-se o 3D e agora tem que encostar aparelho (tm) ao ouvido e andar sempre assim - passados 10 minutos já não aguenta a posição. O preço esse ficou na mesma. A exposição, que num domingo à tarde estava completamente vazia, não merece a visita. É constituída por 4 andares, e cada andar tem alguns quadros virtuais cujo texto explicativos se pode ouvir no aparelho. A qualidade daquilo que está exposto é má e os aparelhos também não funcionam bem!
Não faça como nós; Antes de ir ver a exposição, tente informar-se sobre o que é realmente a exposição tem para ver e decida se mesmo assim tem interesse. Nós não aconselhamos!",2
I do not recommend! We were left without the tour.,"They didn't show up. We waited at the hotel for 1 hour and there was no contact. I tried calling and sending messages through the app and no one answered. Much later they informed that they were going to return the money and that ARC had problems with their car. Being left without information is the worst, without the tour it's horrible, I just hope they refund the amount. I do not recommend!",1
Centre in the centre,"It 'a shopping center in the center of Lisbon decidedly small and scarce
Few shops and not as quaint as you would expect from a shopping center located in the city center. Even the food court is international of little standard; here, however, some interesting proposals can be found.",2
It only gets worse year by year.,"Very bad, in the middle of the rain they turn off the sockets in the power supply area. The toilets are always full. It appears there is only one at the restaurant location and one at Starbucks.
Rude security guards and terrible center staff. He never has the patience to give information.
A place that I used a lot for work due to its location but I will have to change.
Increasingly a place for English to see.
I don't know what this administration thinks, but it certainly doesn't think about the Portuguese.",1
Expensive and disorganized,"We had a friendly driver. The tour booking and execution seemed a bit disorganized, we tried communicating with the tour group prior to the departure day and asked a few times if they could please communicate with us via text message but ended up having to search for their number when the pickup was late. We also had a change in itinerary for something that happened last week resulting in the closure of one of the stops. We would have liked to be told so we could have potentially cancelled or been ready. Also, my friend mentioned the trip felt as if we paid for a very expensive Uber. We did like the ability to spend more time in CasCais. Overall not worth $95/per person.",2
Poor route guidance to the castles stuff.,"What poor signage to get there. Eventually too late so asked for money back answer was no.
So I say flare that shit and never get there again.",1
I guess you get what you pay for,"Driver/guide arrived 1 hour later than the time scheduled at booking. The excuse was that it was raining but the rain was predicted so he should have accounted for the extra traffic, that he says happens when raining, and left earlier ! Guide had to be regularly asked to speak up as he couldn’t be heard in the back of the van. He regularly asked how long people wanted to stay somewhere but ignored our answers. He claimed to be following the rain schedule yet turned a 10 minute bathroom break into a 45 minute lecture ( when it wasn’t raining) in a less important location only to arrive at an important monument during the most torrential downpour. Because of his late start and the 45 minute bathroom break we arrived in Evora after 1:30 just leaving enough time for lunch and no free time ( also stores were all closed for afternoon break ). We proceeded on with the rest of the sites and when leaving for Lisbon I asked What time we would arrive at our hotel and if he could possibly drop us off first, he shrugged and said 6 PM in Lisbon but then stopped unexpectedly at another spot for “ 5 minutes” which apparently means 20 minutes. . We had commitments later and felt the least he could do would be to try to estimate the late arrival time. I will give him credit for his knowledge of the sites and no credit for his attitude, that’s why the tour gets 1 star instead of 0 stars.",1
Disappointment in Lisbon with cancellation of booked Tour to Sintra,"Booked tour - Full day tour :Sintra, Pena Palace, Cabo da Roca, Cascais - approximately one month ago. Arrived in Lisbon late Sunday evening and received email early Monday morning advising that tour to Sintra, booked for 8.30am start on Tuesday morning, was cancelled. No reason for cancellation given and any options were not satisfactory as Tuesday was only day we could do tour. Very disappointing performance by the Tour Operator that books through TripAdvisor. A rating of 1 out of 5 was too high but system prohibits me scoring any lower.",1
Great places- not so good service,"The placea to visit were great, but the tour we took was a disaster!! They offered to pick up at our hotel, but then sent a message to pick us up in a location about 7 min away, that wasn’t that bad, but the guide arrived late, dressed not really professional, with a van that looked that it has seen better days, and with an apprentice that ate for the first part of the tour!!! Our guide tried real hard to be funny, and his accent was sometimes difficult to understand. But the funniest and worst part was when we got stranded in Cabo da Roca because the battery in our van died!! Our guide wasn’t sure of what to do, he did not have cables, and it took about an hour for some other people to help him to push the van and for us to get out of there.

That cut our trip short, as we just had 30 min in Cascais, since some people in our tour already had reservations for early dinner. We tried to make the most out of it and to take it on the light side, but we were disappointed for not spending more time in Cascais.
Overall the places are beautiful, but the experience with the tour operator was terrible, I believe the company is Around Lisbon. So if you are going to this tour, please find another tour operator.",2
Avoid!,"We had Diogo as our tour guide. He tried very hard to give a thorough tour with historical info- but he talked too much and was really quite vague and hard to understand in English. Additionally, the first van from this company had mechanical issues. The second (replacement van) was older than the first- and had virtually NO a/c. I would NOT recommend this tour company",2
If you have lack of time to tour Lisbon- you can miss this. Do the Sintra and other tours.,"It was raining and to hit 4 towns on this tour is too rushed. Places like Batalha and Obidos that I wish would have longer time wasn’t possible. I didn’t really enjoy because it’s too rushed. 10-15 mins at Batalha and only 30 mins at Obidos.
Fatima was average and this was given more time.
Nazare had good beach restaurant food.",2
Cancellation unacceptable,Our trip was canceled one and a half hours before departure because the tour guide got sick. Cancellation is unacceptable as there should be back up tour guides. We could not find an alternative trip and wasted one day.,1
Disappointed,"Our tour guide was very knowledgeable in locations we were touring, but unfortunately due to the acoustics in the van my family was unable to hear him. We sat in the last row and had a difficult time. The vans should be updated and the driver should be equipped with a microphone so all guests can enjoy the experience.
In addition when we stopped in Sintra our tour leader didn’t offer many suggestions for our two hour stop. He only provided a restaurant which happened to have been very expensive.",2
The owner kicked us out,"It was one of my favorite bars until yesterday, but I had the misfortune of meeting the owner. We were kicked out of the bar and shortly after that we saw another customer being attacked by security guards.",1
TERRIBLE experience,"A TERRIBLE experience. Extremely unpleasant staff, starting with the girl who serves at the bar. The girl in question, in addition to being extremely rude and having an aggressive speech with customers, has no manners at all, and makes a point of seeking trouble. I don't know what a girl like that does in a customer service sector. The same security guard, a complete brute, and extremely violent. Unfortunately we were forced to report the situation to the police. If you are willing to be brutally attacked, for free and without reason, I recommend it, otherwise, there are MUCH BETTER options (price/ambience) very close by.",1
They do me no favor...,"Good afternoon.

I didn't like the service at the Tabak store. The employee (Portuguese), new girl (wore piercing ...) seemed to be doing me a great favor. There was an absolutely normal behavior on my part, as a customer, to ask for Euromillions. By the way, I didn’t even start any kind of conversation with her, and I wasn’t even interested.
I did not like the attitude, gives the Impression that customers are not welcome and this is exactly the opposite of what should be.
I got upset and I won't come back. You just lost (at least ...) a customer!!

I have said
A good afternoon
LC",2
Zero seriousness,"I took some time to value this business because I was so angry. And why? Because I was last year and they told me to make the hat that I wanted to tailor, what is my surprise when this year I go (ex-profess) and they tell me that summer hats are not made by them and that they will not make me and well I order two winter and I get one perfect and another clearly of one or two sizes more, claim and tell me that they do not have felt of (precisely) that color (what a chance) and that they can make me another of another color.
In the end I gave up because I don't think it's serious and I got paid back.
But the money I spend on going, the hotel and the inconvenience those who pay me?.
Draw conclusions, I will not return, zero seriousness",1
Horrible.,"Horrible, you don't realize anything, artistic scenes just because you do.

Absurdly poorly sized, I only saw heads and backs, it looked like the Metro at 6:00.",1
Medium,"Disappointed with the performance of the actors as well as the entire framework (or lack of it) on the part of the organization. Although it is a different experience with well-decorated space - the price is exorbitant!
Super confused, at the entrance could introduce a little the scenarios, where certain scenes will take place, etc...
Not to mention that the actors choose spectators for an “exclusive” scene. The staff pays between 40 and 60 euros and only a few at the alleys have the right to watch part of the story.
Rooms and hallways full of spectators that prevented the normal movement of actors or that all people watch the selected scenes.",2
Overvalued,"Clearly overvalued. Overcrowded rooms, actors running from room to room and dozens of people in shallow hallways to meet each other to try to accompany or find the minimum conductor thread. Depending on the character you accompany, who has a ""loop"" of acting smaller or larger, can or can not perceive the least of what is going on.
After the initial confusion and stumbling out of the rooms and walking lost, I followed (which only in the end knew) the shaman. A confused and unconnected loop, which reveals nothing about the main story, finished the loop of this character, the play ends and I am referred to the final performance room, without knowing who those characters are, how and why they got there.
End.
I still bought the booklet to try some additional clarification.
Anyway, an immense frustration and a wasted night.
For those who can identify and accompany one of the main characters, it may be a different experience, is very devoted to chance.
The only positive point is the reconversion of the military hospital and the decorations.
A wasted night.",1
Bad and confused!,"It's not worth the price. I found myself too confused and lost. Out of smoke and smell. I couldn’t identify the characters, even when the people and names were at the entrance, they could have paid that attention and explained or given in the pamphlet the faces and names, I couldn’t understand the story, and I just felt lost with so many people pushing and running after characters. The actors were a little aggressive because if necessary they would go against people and walk too fast. We didn’t all fit in the same room, which didn’t even allow everyone to watch the play. Besides me there was a lot of lost people that ended up messing up everything. I have attended several experiences of this kind and this one was undoubtedly the worst. I don't recommend it to older people because you have to run away from people. Small and tight spaces is quite dark with a lot of smoke. Not recommended for people with claustrophobia.",2
Not advisable to claustrophobics,Not recommended for those suffering from claustrophobia due to the narrow and poorly illuminated corridors. I stayed 2 hours standing by a wall of the entrance. I was sorry because it should be quite interesting,1
I do not recommend,"I did not notice anything. There is not a word throughout the experience or at the end to clarify what happened. I don't understand the positive reviews, I don't understand the price. Basically I can't understand what just happened, I just know that I definitely don't recommend it.",1
A night of abuse!,"Unless you enjoy being pushed around, knocked over by rude patrons and actors save your money.
Afterwards when leaving I saw one of the patrons who was most aggressively shoving people and an actor who forcible pushed people out of a room leaving together.
We paid for VIP access which basically gets you an opportunity to wait inside instead of outside. You get a head start before the masses come stampeding in and something to drink. Your choice of drinks are water, coffee, and Heineken.",1
To avoid,There is no possible description for such a lack of respect for customers. There are many places in Lisbon to dance. Don't go to this one.,1
Poor service and non-existent reservation information,"Terrible! Me, my husband and a couple friends, were blocked from entering, because we didn't have a reservation, by a doorman who barely opened the door and when nowhere is there information that it is necessary to make a reservation, through Google there is even the information that they do not accept reservations (as shown in the attached photo). I do not recommend!",1
To forget,"Have you forgotten that companies live for their customers?? And that these only return if they are well treated?
What a lack of sympathy.",2
Night space to report,"Bad site. Attitude of rude and arrogant doormen.
It is unacceptable to have an open space in Lisbon these days with this characteristic. I doubt the legality of this attitude. I think he should be reported.",1
"Beautiful space, only the DJ ruins the house!!!","We visited the space for the first time on the recommendation of some friends, and we loved everything, except the DJ, who doesn't seem to know what he's doing, it ruins the energy of the music.

We intend to come back but let's confirm first which DJ is the one on Friday, February 3rd, no thanks",2
Lisbon at its worst,Terrible. Discrimination. They use the reservation excuse to leave customers at the door. We were two couples in their 40s. Apparently they only enter after 50 and 60. It's for geriatrics.,1
Discrimination,"On December 9, 2023, I went to that night space with 4 other friends (Discoteca Primorosa de Alvalade located on Avenida Estados Unidos da América, number 128 in Lisbon) in order to have fun and we were informed by the doorman, a very rude, that we could only enter with an advance reservation.
It turns out that nothing was mentioned at the entrance, and that the telephone number to make the reservation was disconnected.
People arrived and we asked outside that space if they had a reservation and they said no.
Because of this, I and the 4 people who accompanied me felt discriminated against. Because we were all dressed decently, with appropriate behavior.
I emphasize that we were not the only ones to be rejected by that space.
So I felt discriminated against.
I hope that this complaint of mine has at least one warning in that space I mentioned.",1
Worst space in Lisbon,The space is horrible and the service is second to none. The doorman is extremely rude and violent. I don't recommend it to anyone.,1
Lisbon's pseudo-exclusive kitch.,"The immature and somewhat laughable objective of managing this space in Lisbon is to create a kind of false exclusivity to make it appear that it is a special, innovative or even beautiful place. In fact, the space itself has its charm precisely because it is a kind of ""kitch capsule"" of time, with music and clientele decor that was accidentally frozen in 1985 and thawed in 2023. Ladies who are half grandmothers and have their hair burnt because they are painted many times and gentlemen in blazers with whiskey veins on their noses. Completely absurd prices, popular fair music. I recommend visiting, for the fun and then not coming back.",1
I do not recommend,"Discriminatory entry.
And he stated that he only entered with reservation when this information was not evident anywhere",1
Rude,I've been to this place twice and the response was always the same. Reservation is required. Unbelievable. In 40 years it has never happened to me. It's an unbelievable lack of respect.,1
A lot of lack of common sense and vision.,"I can't evaluate why they didn't let me enter a space where I've always entered since POP, passing the real ""Primorosa de Alvalade"" where there was always a bottle and ending up in Sarabanda. It's incredible how classy spaces deteriorate and become vulgar spaces with idiotic restrictions, especially for couples who just want to remember good times spent together.",1
"Musica pessima por dj's que nao sabem o que fazem, por isso esta quase vazio!!!","espaço muito bonito mas com os piores djs que já ouvi, tocam sem sentido estragam as musicas dos anos dourados. Nas ultimas 3 visitas que fiz ao espaço com amigos desistimos de voltar, perdeu a magia que se vivia neste espaço com o dj anterior e nota-se que antes era casa cheia e agora quase vazia. Uma pena!",1
Perigoso e violento,"Perigoso , caso de policia que foi chamada ao local , pediram-nos 200,00 por pessoa , aceitamos pagar , surpresos e muito pouco evoluídos , não nos trouxeram o MB, fecharam a Porta violentamente . Começamos a filmar pois sentimos a nossa integridade física em risco , o porteiro altamente violento arrancou o telemóvel da mão por 3 vezes e empurrou-nos , a policia teve que o ir buscar. ao interior. o caso sera conduzido segundo recomendação policial . Percebemos que a polícia tem sido recorrentemente chamada a esta casa.que Ja deu o que tinha a dar . Depois de uma semana de muito trabalho , jantamos no restaurante de um amigo no Chiado e a caminho de casa apeteceu-nos ir dançar , infeliz ideia ter escolhido esta casa vizinha onde ja vou a tanto tempo . Sempre gostei imenso do staff todos uma simpatia e de uma educação extrema . Este porteiro e outro senhor que com ele estava ( so dizia palavrões) nunca os tinha visto e se os voltar a ver provavelmente sera em tribunal .
Podia acontecer a um filho nosso , de fugir

Tchin tchin",1
Primorosa de Elite,"Infelizmente a faixa etária permitida é acima dos 50 anos. Fomos um grupo de amigos em festa de aniversário. Estávamos bem vestidos, maquilhadas e um grupo de pessoas bonitas nos seus 30’s. À entrada cheguei (40’s) com uma amiga e grupo vinha atrás. O porteiro perguntou se vinha com o grupo e respondi afirmativamente. “Têm reserva?” “Só com reserva.”
Ficámos um pouco para decidir onde ir de seguida e podemos confirmar o “tipo” de pessoas às quais nem perguntavam se tinham reserva. Parece-me mais um clube de elite do que um bar aberto ao público.",1
Discriminação! Péssimo!,"Lamentável a atitude dos porteiros, tratamento rude e discriminatória. Éramos 3 amigas com intenção de ir beber um copo e conhecer o espaço, informaram que não tínhamos reserva e por esse motivo não poderíamos entrar. O grupo de seguida entrou sem qualquer reserva.",1
PÉSSIMA! MÁ EDUCAÇÃO! DISCRIMINATÓRIOS! RUDE E ARROGANTES!,"Já sou cliente da Primorosa faz algum tempo, o espaço era dos mais recomendava em Lisboa, pelo ambiente e tratamento ao cliente!

Hoje venho aqui dizer e denunciar a forma mal educada e rude que eu e os meus amigos fomos tratados pelos porteiros deste sítio, impedindo de nos entrar dizendo que era preciso reserva, expliquei que era o meu aniversário, mostrei o meu cartão de cidadão e tudo, mesmo assim barraram-nos a entrada! Várias pessoas entraram depois de nós e ficámos a saber que o problema seria a nossa faixa etária, espante-se que todo o meu grupo tínhamos acima de 30, alguns 40!

Fiquei a descobrir que além de MAL EDUCADOS, FAZEM DISCRIMINAÇÃO DAS PESSOAS PELA FAIXA ETÁRIA!

NÃO RECOMENDO ESTE SÍTIO A NINGUÉM, FOI EM TEMPOS UM BOM ESPAÇO, HOJE EM DIA JUNTAM-SE ALI PESSOAS DISCRIMINATÓRIAS E MAL EDUCADAS!

IREI APRESENTAR TAMBÉM QUEIXA FORMAL NA POLÍCIA SOBRE ESTE MESMO ESPAÇO E A DISCRIMINAÇÃO QUE EU E AMIGOS FOMOS ALVO!",1
Resolutely ignored!,"I have just come from traipsing up the hill, dragging my poor three kids with me, having a 30 minute window before leaving Lisbon. I have desperately wanted to come here for years to talk about Portuguese rugs and to look at buying quite a few. I waited politely for the shop assistant to finish her last customer with a multitude of packages. She didn’t acknowledge me. I just thought she was busy. Now I’m not so sure? Maybe it was because I was standing in the wrong place? Were there rules I didn’t know about? Another customer came up wanting to buy something. She serves him straight away and they started to chat. I find it so jaw droppingly rude I give up.

Such a shame. That wouldn’t happen in a shop that cared about craft and people. I feel so BAD for all the hardworking craftspeople and artisans being badly represented. It looks as if they’re hardly selling the better made Alentejo Blankets anyway and selling cheaper versions. Such a HUGE disappointment.",1
Bad management! Admission only with guided tours at fixed times and not indicated on the site!,"I consult the website and read the opening hours, nothing else is specified. We do half an hour by tram to reach it... and of course another half an hour to return... but you can not visit! You enter only with guided tours. It was half past noon and the guided tour was at half past two. Of course we could not stay two hours there waiting and we had no way to return except missing the afternoon!!!! I'm very sorry because I would have liked to see it, I'm sorry I wasted more than an hour for nothing! I pointed out that on their website it is not indicated that you enter only with guided tours nor that there were fixed times of entry but they did not even reply! Along with us were 4 other people who, of course, left. Congratulations for the management!😡",1
"No real Lisbon, avoid","There is no real feel of Lisbon unfortunately. The area were cruise ships port and the high street shops were was clean and pleasant.

Everywhere else once you moved from this tourist area was full of nomads and expats, didn't see any Lisbons. There are old houses and dirty streets that reeked, people urinating in the streets as toilets are ""pay by coin"" and many don't carry cash anymore. There are no public bathrooms anywhere otherwise. Streets with dog waste everywhere...

Got offered drugs multiple times a day however the guys selling it were really polite so didn't feel unsafe.

There are so many great places to visit so I would never recommend for anyone to go to Lisbon based on our experience and what we saw.",1
Bad experience,"We had dinner after waiting for an hour despite the reservation: bad food to say the least, equally bad service and prices definitely much higher than the very poor quality of the food.",1
Boring,"Bairro Alto area (or ""High Town"") I liked least in Lisbon (only Alfama is worse). There's nothing interesting here. We came up here from Baixa using the cable car Elevador da Gloria and the first thing we saw was a more or less pleasant open-air place with wooden tables and pavilions with street food. Then a couple of steps was viewpoint called Miradouro de Sao Pedro de Alcantara was not bad, but how many such observation platforms are there in Lisbon and in general in all major cities! The rest of the walk was hot and boring. There are old houses and dirty streets. Maybe this district works for the young people who visit the bars and clubs here, but not for the average tourists who want to see the sights. They are not here, don't waste your time.",2
Dangerous area!,Dangerous place at night! Stay away especially at night with cheap drinks and cheap people! Bouncers and customers looking for trouble!,1
Overated City,"Overrated city. It used to be a beautiful and authentic city but like many other European cities, its personality is gone.
Packed with tourists all year long, old and authentic businesses closed due to the locals running away from the city because of crazy  expensive prices for tourists and expect to find a tourist trap restaurant, souvenir and cafe on every corner, especially downtown and wherever you have a touristic attraction.
Lisbon is now a destination hub for bachelor parties, so expect to find  a dirty and smelly city, especially in the morning.
Be careful when using Uber services, especially if you are a woman. Uber services like most of the tourist traps businesses are now being running by suspicious Indians and moroccans and many problems with quality, safety and robbery are rising.
Locals run away from it. The city is empty of locals and you will only find nomads, expats and the poor and old that cannot afford to run away.
One of the most expensive European cities right now to live, to eat, to  visit.",1
Beware of the Oscar Burger stall in Barrio Alto,"Beware of the agressive man at the Oscar stall.

The views were lovely. We went up the tram and went to the viewing point at the top.

However, we had an awful experience at the outdoor food court at the top of the cable car where the viewing point is. I went to try the Bifana (a Portuguese traditional sandwich) at Oscar burger stall. What I got was a lump of dry plain meat sandwiched between an equally dry stale bun (see pic). I went back after opening the wrapper and showed the man and told him this is nothing like a bifana sandwich and also didn't one bit resemble the photo that he had displayed on his stall of a bifana sandwich. He rudely refused to accept that what he had served was inedible and was agressive and refused to give me a refund. I was taken back by his attitude and left frustrated and took a pic of the stall as I sat down. He then walked over to where I was sitting with my 5 and 8 year old children and swore at me, shouting abuse to my face. He was not happy that I had taken a pic of his stall. Shouting at a customer and especially intimidating a woman in front of her children is really not OK. I was left shaken, my little girl was crying as she was left frightened. We left immediately and the kids no longer wanted to stay in Barrio Alto and we got the tram back.
Think twice before going near his stall.",1
Might be nicer during the day!,"Bar and club area very popular with tourists. VERY stag do heavy and reminiscent of the Maga strip - if you’re looking for a quiet drink go elsewhere. Clubs rammed and music pretty awful! Would not really recommend, try a rooftop Bar instead.",2
"Traurig, doch auch mit vielen liebenswerten Menschen","Oh weh....Alles kaputt, verfallen, dreckig, laut, ungemütlich. So ziemlich die traurigste Stadt, die man sich vorstellen kann. Die gesamte Altstadt vom Tejo beidseitig, zum Castel, Kirchen, Gassen, Promenade, alles sind wir abgelaufen und sind erschüttert. Armut und Verfall. Menschen durchwühlen Müllkisten, leben in Karton-Bauten, Häuser sehen baufällig aus, zerbröseln beschmiert. Das tut einfach nur weh.....",1
It was all messy and not settled,"A nice tour but very messy. Our guide was Philippe, very nice but as a guide underwhelmed. It wasn't a big deal in English but he spent the whole tour pretending it was a theatre. That was disturbing for the whole group. We also had a flat tire that could not be repaired and the bikes were quite worn. My trouser leg and jacket were covered in grease. The tour costs quite a bit of money so some professional approach may also be appropriate. At the starting point the guides are busy with each other and jokes are plentiful. That was before two years ago when I made the same tour many times better. I cannot recommend it and would find another party.",2
Pessimo!,"2 pessoas. Encomendamos 1 queijinho fresco, 1 pastel de bacalhau, 1 dose de dourada, Salmão grelhados e 2 imperiais. Os pratos de peixe vieram meio crús. Não aceitamos a dourada, que nao tinha 400 a 450gr indicadas no menu, que voltou para traz, regressando a mesma! 10 minutos mais tarde, ainda mal passada, seca e salgadissima! Valor total da factura: 51,10€ (Cinquenta e um € e dez centimos) Serviço de cozinha péssimo! Informei o empregado de mesa do que estava mal e lhe pedi para informar o gerente. Não sei se o fez. Ninguém disse uma palavra. Senti-me defraudado. A nunca mais voltar!",1
Waste of money and vacationtime,"We wanted to take a look inside to see what dancestyles and atmosphere there was. After being in barrio latino of 10min and not liking the club we still had to pay the €7 pp enterance fee.
They were very unfriendly and unwelcoming towards tourists. Waste of money and time.",1
Avoid at all costs,"Avoid at all costs. The service is poor, the drinks range is small and the quality of the food is awful. My partner ordered Lamb Croquettes. When they came they were cold. She ate the first of the 5, blandcand no seasoning, the second one had some grisle , the third was all grisle and the fourth had a piece of bone in it. She refused to eat the other.
I had steak sandwich, it left a lot to be desired. Chewy, and certainly not hot. Chips were greasy.
When asked if all was OK at the end of the meal, we said NO. The waiter spoke to the head waiter, who was seen to shrug his shoulders and shake his head.
The head waiter then came over, not a word spoken, offered the card machine, took 42 Euros for the food, then walked off. No apology, no reduction, no nothing.
Considering the place is mentioned in the Lonely Planet guide book, we were very disappointed.
Certainly won't go again and CERTAINLY WON'T RECOMMEND.
I created a trip advisor account just to leave this review as I was disgusted with the place",1
Just keep walking past,"Just Keep walking past this place. Beautiful location but experience was horrible. My 21 year old daughter and I stopped in for drinks and lunch on our way to Belem tower. Waited 15 mins to take our drinks order. When cocktails came they were warm and an order of chicken tacos took over an hour. You literally have to chase the servers down for any sort of responsiveness. Seems very poorly organized, no hostess or buzzers only servers so they’ve obviously overwhelmed.",1
NO RECOMENDADO,"NO RECOMENDADO.
Coca cola 4€, sin gas y de grifo, tardaron 20min en servirla y encima no te hacen ni caso si quieres quejarte.",1
Very unfriendly place!,"Very unfriendly place! I love Lisbon and people from Portugal they are all family centrist. I asked politely to use their bathroom with my 5 years old little girl, offered to buy drink or pay for the service but the waiter and the main guy was shocking reluctant and chased us away humiliatingly. I have never experience such an inhumane place in Portugal. Never go there!",1
Awful. Simply Awful,"Awful

Been here an hour. Food came out and was stone cold. It was sent to another table and just sat there.

Staff are useless. Young and poorly trained. They have zero customer service.

Great setting but avoid at all costs.

Waste of time.",1
Fatal,"Worst place in the world, if you're lone women don't ever go. As a woman they respect nothing, a shame. The worst place in Lisbon",1
Criminal cesspool. Worst experience in Portugal,"Bouncers are criminals working with the hood rats working the corner in pink street. Worst experience ever in Portugal. Do not ever go there. A naive friend got cornerd and robbed for €600,- by about 8-9 guys with the help of one of the bouncers working there @ around 23:30. 24.july. Frick this place",1
DO NOT GO NO MATTER WHAT,"do not go here no matter what happens even if you offered €100 do not go!!!! me and four of my friends went into the bar. Everything is OK. We stepped outside to smoke a cigarette then we are denied reentry. We are walking away from the bar and the bouncer comes up and punches, my friend. We call him some names and walk away again within five minutes there’s 30 other bouncers all on us and we’re getting beaten and tased out of pink Street. AVOID AT ALL COSTS THIS IS A NORMAL THING HERE",1
Fuyez,A shame run away. They're scamming. They charge above the Award shown on the card without refunding you. And they take foreigners and French for fools,1
Dull and dead,"As you arrive onto the pink street you are hit with high energy and good music, a fun and lively atmosphere and fully expecting the vibes to carry on along the whole street only to find it stops dead as soon as you turn the slight corner, it was such a stark contrast in an instant. Unfortunately this is where the Liverpool bar is situated and it wasn’t a surprise to find it completely empty apart from two bored looking men, was very disappointed as expected a lot more!",1
Bouncer type security,"Terrible experience, a completely unprepared security guard at the door, we didn't even get to eat due to the totally uneducated and rude approach of the security guard at the entrance near the tables.",1
Terrible,"One word terrible. Food and service was unreal, we ordered 4 items to share, 3 only came out after a 45 minutes wait, the 4 came out after we complained to them.",1
It's not worth going there,"It is not worth getting here, far from the rest of the tourist areas, to see this basilica. Just for the ride on 28.",2
Better skip,"Church never open, only access to the top. Don’t even think about to go there, you will only see the boring outside!",1
Little information,"Unfortunately, the guide only spoke English, even though we had requested German. A tour like this could be done better. Not much information.",1
,"Beat Balls Porto - Poor organization and lack of professionalism. They do not answer the phone, do not answer whatsapp and when they respond, do it completely late.",1
Miserable Service,"We contacted the BeatBalls Porto organizer and tried to set a date. As it was not very early (4 days before) said that he had not arranged staff and asked if it could be on the weekend. We said yes and the day before the event again said that after all there was no staff. All this always takes a huge time to respond by WhatsApp and I don't know why there is a number to call, since they never came to answer. Organization and professionalism 1/5.",1
communication,"very bad communication. resond to mail, then doesnt repond anymore. i would not recommend to use this service as it is very difficult contact.",1
Waste of time,A reservation was made at a defined location and the company didn't even show up to provide the service for a group of 30. I expected more professionalism.,1
"TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE PROFESSIONALISM, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL!!!","Terrible service and professionalism!!!
I got in touch with the company as I was organizing a bachelor party, I spoke personally and exchanged some emails with the ""operations manager"", Mr.Antonio Cardoso, who sent me prices and to get everything sorted out, was the time available and the field to reserve for bubllefootbal , we are from the Setubal area and were going to Porto! At a certain point and 2 days before the event, Mr. Antonio stopped responding and answering the phone number, I called the fields that they sublease, in the industrial area of Porto, to which They told me that there was nothing marked with my name, they hadn't even called!!! In other words, the day before and with 10 people going to Porto I had no activity and no satisfaction at all! The funny thing is 2 days after the event, I called and the man there answered, after some things he had to hear from me, he said that they had a complicated week!!! Apparently these things happen frequently with beatballs.... which is why I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE AT ALL, terrible professionalism and even lack of respect for customers, as they assured us that everything was ok, and then simply disappeared until the day of the event, and reappeared 2 days later!",1
Very disappointed with the experience.,"Very disappointed with the experience.
We had booked a beerbike activity and were well present at 5pm, scheduled departure time. Unfortunately, no one was there to welcome us. After waiting, the tour finally started late, which reduced our activity to only 30 minutes instead of an hour. We asked for a partial refund or a commercial gesture, but this was denied. Total lack of professionalism and no consideration for customers. Don't.
Namely that they changed 3 times days and time",1
I do not recommend,"I don't recommend it. Catch tourist!
Sangria in a cubi, canned beer, no atmosphere, does not go to the tower of Belem...",1
Not commercial...,"Our flights were canceled, we were not able to participate in the activity, but no commercial gesture for a possible refund or compensation was made.
I find this regrettable since not doing the activity was not up to us.
We had booked other activities in Lisbon which they understood the situation and reimbursed us without problem.
Go on your way, I think there are some companies more serious than others.",1
Nightmare,"There were no cold drinks. After 20 minutes you finally served hot beer. The bike wasn't working because the gears were not working and it was almost impossible to move the bike forward. It also made a lot of noise and the whole thing shook. I had beer all over my shoes because the ""bartender"" didn't know how to open the beers. And a 2 liter bottle filled with fluid fell from the shelf right next to my head. After like 50 meters we left.

I think the difference between what you sold me and what you delivered was significantly. I think your vehicle is worn out. I think in the sense of law you'd call it fraud.

JUST DONT!!!",1
Badly disposed employee.,Badly disposed employee. Unpleasant experience. Madalena urgently needs love. Bad-tempered and rude.,2
Trap for tourist,"Nice place with a view on the bridge, fresh fish but not cooked well, very oily and the most important part “they trick the tourist”. When you seat you find food on the table thinking that has been offered and instead you pay it very much.
In the end they say “oh that’s how it works in Portugal, you can decide to eat that or not”.
Stay away",2
Very disappointing,"My daughter bought a lovely ring for a reasonably significant sum of money. The young woman who served us in the store was lovely and said please don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any issues. Shortly after our return home, the chunky ring snapped into two pieces, this seems highly unusual and would make me seriously question the quality. I have emailed the team at Bergue jewelry twice and received no response even though I have the receipt to show purchse",1
Poor quality,"Gilding that leaves after a week….

S-courtesy and arrogance!,"S…. Courtesy, arrogance!! I entered the bookstore because I read that it is the oldest still open, but I found a bookcase like many, nothing special. At the bottom a bar with saleswomen who did not even dignify us with a look, nor a greeting and while we arrived what we had ordered with my friends, I asked for a bathroom that I did not use until the payment for drinks... the bathroom a disaster and in the library at least 4-5 saleswomen without doing anything!",1
Disrespectful treatment,"This bookshop is usually my first stop when I travel to Lisbon. I love it for its wide selection of books and magazines, along with its charm being a more traditional bookstore. Unfortunately, yesterday I had a very uncomfortable experience with an employee who refused to let me go to the bathroom. I had already bought a book and a magazine a few days earlier, and the book with the bookstore stamp was still in my bag, as I informed her. However, without the receipt from the same day, she refused to let me in. This part of the bookstore was not busy at all and the employee didn't seem very busy either. But she told me to find a restroom in another establishment and then return to purchase a book. After this experience I didn't feel like going back and bought my book in another bookshop. Unnecessarily arrogant treatment. As a frequent customer it seems very strange that I am rejected the visit of the bathroom in that manner, baring in mind that I was carrying a recently purchased book.",1
Disappointing,"The library boasts the title of the oldest library in the world and will naturally attract tourists wanting to see this marvel. However, the staff deliver a very unfriendly service, it is almost like tourists (who are paying customers) are an inconvenience to the cashiers.

They could have made a lot more of the building given it it so old.

Would stick to Waterstones.",2
Tourists are bad!,"For the first time in over 35 years of going to Betrand, which is near my house. I was pushed by a tourist. I pushed back and he fell, appropriately, into the José Saramago section. Lisbon has too many tourists, mostly rude, who go to these historic places in the centre and don't buy a thing.",1
Not interesting.,"Well, I went to the oldest bookstore, but I was outside again within a few minutes. Really not interesting. Then you better go to the bookstore in the church in Maastricht!",1
Horrible service and online experience!,"Personally, I don't know, but on the website I had difficulty registering payment methods, and because of that I was unable to buy my books. But so far, so good. The real problem is the terrible service, both on the website and on social media. Through social media, they simply don’t respond. And on the website, it took them two days to respond to me, in fact, it was an automatic message as it had no connection with the question I asked, they just ""filled it with sausage"".",1
The staff is of no advice!,"The staff is of no advice...
The Bertrand bookstore claims to be one of the oldest bookstores in Portugal.
The staff is too busy to advise tourist customers who are looking for a specific book.",2
Trato pésimo,"Fuimos de vacaciones a Lisboa. El último día, antes de regresar a España entramos a la librería para comprar un ejemplar y de paso nos pusieran el sello de reconocimiento como librería más antigua del mundo en funcionamiento.Cual fue nuestra sorpresa, que después de esperar más de media hora, repito más de media hora,(cosa que puedo llegar a entender, aunque sólo hubiese una persona atendiendo a los clientes, recordando que es una librería turística con bastante afluencia), sin haber ningún cartel informando de que sólo se podía pagar con tarjeta. Cuando llegó mi turno nos rechazaron la compra por no pagar con tarjeta sin darnos ninguna solución alternativa. Le explicamos que volvíamos a España a la mañana siguiente pero insistieron que solo podíamos pagar con tarjeta.
Sospechamos que quedaba media hora para cerrar y no querían cobrar en metálico para no tener que volver a hacer la caja.
Con lo cual denota falta de profesionalidad hacia el cliente además de poco empatía al turismo que no reside allí y no podemos volver.
Así que no puedo recomendarla por el trato recibido.",1
Não temos post-it!,"Dirigi-me à Bertrand onde comprei um conjunto de livros por mais de 160 euros. No momento de pagar pedi que me embrulhassem três dos livros por serem para presentes. Para não me esquecer que livro continha cada embrulho pedi que me escrevessem os títulos em post-its para depois serem colados nos embrulhos. A resposta que recebi da colaboradora foi seca dizendo que não tinha post-ir, passando-me uma esferográfica para eu escrever no embrulho. Eu não acredito que a livraria Bertrand não tenha post-it. Foi simplesmente má vontade e este tipo de comportamentos associados pagar-se. Como? Comprando noutros locais...",2
Oldest Bookstore in the World,"I came here with my family in April 2022 but when I saw how simple the store was, I decided just to quickly do a lap inside by myself. There wasn't much inside that made it seem old(er) than a standard building. There was a children's book section in the back, which I studied for a tiny bit (and then realized my kids wouldn't be able to understand any of the non-English board books).",2
Nothing much,"It's not worth it, landscapes without beauty and emotions, good for getting rid of toxins and if you really want to go, I recommend going early in the morning, the sun beats down hard

Don't bother waiting for a ride,Historic funicular which looks great but it's tiny and is too small for the number of tourists wanting to ride. It's not worth waiting ages for a ride up the street that only lasts a few minutes. The best thing is to see it from the top and just take some pics but no point in wasting lots of time trying to get onto it.,2
"Horrible staff, to avoid","Terrifying experience.
Not recommended to everyone.

I knew this elevator having gone there years ago, I found it nice and I wanted to take my husband and my 5-year-old son there after years, enthusiastic about the experience. We climb up from the top, and ask the driver, on the phone and rude, if we could get back from the same cab anyway. Rude answer: yes. After waiting for his comfortable, empty cabin, we go down and at the terminus (i.e. after 200 meters) tells us that we have to get down and get back in the kilometer line to go back up. Which she, since she cannot do her job and was busy on the phone during her service, had not had the foresight to tell us! I said it wasn’t right but no, the polite lady with some problems (she started at one point to speak to herself in Portuguese) sent us to queue with the others very rudely, in the end, and, arrived after half an hour at our turn, literally barred the rope before our eyes! This out of clear spite for politely asking for explanations! My astonished son, we therefore waited for the next ride for 20 minutes because Madame does not know how to work and takes out her personal frustration on the patrons at the service she works for. Professionalism less than zero, I hope someone will take action. Leaving a city service in the hands of the incompetent damages Lisbon’s image.",1
Too much waiting... too bad,"Half an hour under the sun waiting in line and the driver only brings in half the car... and he leaves!!
We did not understand why.
People waiting to take this funicular and yet there is only one every 15 minutes...!!
Tourist catch for the folklore of Lisbon
Far too much waiting for a 2-minute climb charged at €4.10
It is better to have planned to buy the weekly unlimited transport pass in Lisbon (€6.40)",2
Exploitation,"We went for the experience. Very beautiful on the outside, very dirty on the inside and very expensive for a 5 minute ride. Pure exploitation.",2
Ugh,"3€80 for 5 minutes return trip typical but horribly expensive for such a short time.
We were a little disappointed by the duration of this activity",2
Mal servicio del personal,"El trayecto corto pero bonito, pero es una lástima la forma con la que se trata al turista, con personal maleducado, de mal aspecto y tratando muy mal a la clientela.",2
Preço demasiado elevado para 1 viagem; o condutor também não prima pela simpatia,"Portuguesa, fui ontem experimentar o elevador da bica, agora que estou reformada. Quando finalmente desci só estava eu e uma estrangeira. fui informada que pagaria no final; quando paguei o valor de 3,80€ que dava direito a 2 viagens fui informada que teria que ir para uma fila que tinha cerca de 15 pessoas e, claro, quando chegou a minha vez já não tive possibilidade de entrar... lamentável!",2
Slaat nergens op,"Wat een onzin: het ding rijdt helemaal niet. Staat gewoon stil, geen trambestuurder erbij, alleen maar massa's toeristen.
Zelfde geldt trouwens voor die lift. Lange rij toeristen om mee te mogen, maar we hebben die lift geen één keer naar beneden of boven zien gaan.",1
Niente di che,"30 minuti di attesa x 5 minuti di viaggio, bello, caratteristico ma 5 minuti.
Se nn avessi avuto la lisboa card nn avrei speso 3,80 euro",2
Bicycle dealer - Flop / Lisbon - Top,"The reasons for the unsatisfactory assessment are as follows:
1. despite timely and repeated contact (about 3 months in advance), the bicycles were insufficiently packed for transport on the plane.
2. As a result, I had to prepare a bike at the airport myself for transport - although the service was part of the contract - and ultimately had to pay for it.
3. Knowledge of handling special baggage was also insufficient. The infrastructure for special baggage dictates the sizes, regardless of the airlines! For bicycles: Length: up to 180cm, Height: up to 90cm, Width: up to 40cm
4. the agreed and of course also paid cleaning service for two bicycles was not provided.
5. the paid and ordered service for two bicycles was also not carried out!
6. the refund of my expenses for service/cleaning offered by Biclas has not been refunded to date.
My rating is based on extensive/reasoned emails!
The Tagus experience from source to mouth was wonderful, the hospitality very good.
Except for the bicycle dealer in Lisbon.
Portugal can only be ashamed of this crook!",1
Old well worn patched up bikes that are not cheap.,"Be aware you may not get the bike as advertised on their website. Three of us rented Giant gravel bikes for a 2 week tour around Portugal. All were well worn, bottom of the line bikes. Mine had the bar tape replaced with gaffer tape which oozed all over my hands. Mine had also had the chainwheel replaced with a 39 tooth small chainwheel on the front. Coupled to a 34 tooth on the rear this meant a lot of walking once grades got over 9%. Portugal is a hilly place. After a couple of days my front brake pads gave out. Expecting this they had supplied brake pads in the spares kit. Unfortunately they were the wrong size and did not fit. I managed to get some that did fit off one of the other riders",2
Bike Tour Disaster,"The GPS app they have you download is terrible. Ride a bike through Sintra? Walk your bike up the narrow, crowded hills? What a joke. The guy who set us up told us it wouldn’t be crowded - just get off the bikes and walk. Yeah, ok! Fairly certain he has never done the self guided tour himself. No real guidance regarding the trains we had to take. Fine. We figure it out, but it would be helpful information. Overall, a failure. After walking our bikes up part of the crowded, narrow street in Sintra we turned around. It wasn’t worth it. People (tourists and locals alike) either laughed at us or made rude comments. I promise you, it’s not worth it.",1
Very nice team. The wheels are in bad condition. Not recommended!,"Since the other bike rental was closed, we tried Bikeiberia and rented two bikes. The team at Bikeiberia is very nice, the service is ok, but the bikes are in poor condition. The shifts are not working properly, the brakes are murks. All in all, you don't enjoy the wheels. And that's what holidays are all about. It's also expensive.",2
Camino de Frances gone wrong,"Arrived at St Jean-Pied-de-Port to start a 14-day trip to complete a leisurely bike trip with friends along the Camino de Frances. The Bike that I had rented 4 months previously was old worn and the batter was wrapped in insulation tape, but I decided that I’m sure its fine they would not have sent a dodge bike. On the second day coming into Estelle, I was soon shown to have been mistaken, the bike faulted while cycling with an alarm “Syncdrive warning”. A thunderstorm soon followed. I reached out hoping there would be an easy solution, there wasn’t. Two towns later and two repair shops later was told I was on my own no replacement bike was available and until confirmed otherwise by their repair shop the issue was my fault and all cost were to be incurred by me. These included transporting the bike between towns the cost of the first repair shop, the second said it wasn’t my issue, and they would bill bike Iberia, they also sent the bike back to Iberia. End result I was two days into my 14-day trip with no bike, my group had moved on, and I had no accommodation arranged. I had to start again sourcing a new bike and having to pay for the holiday a second time.",1
DONT RENT YOUR BIKE HERE!,"Dont ever go here!
Two of our four rented bikes broke so we had to carry our ebikes to a trainstation and bring them back to the rental store!!

The people working there are rude and didnt want to give us money back when we finally came with the bikes. (After extra costs for traintickets!)
They told us to fix the bikes by ourselves..one flat tyre and one chainbreak!! We were pulling and carrying the two bikes for 8km!

Dont rent here!",1
Poor customer service,We rented 5 electric bikes had to pay cash !!! after 2km one of the bike chain broke. We called for help we were told to get a train back- no apologies ! We didn’t want to terminate our tour as we only had the bikes for three hours. We found a bike store that repaired the chain. As we returned we were given no apologies and the guy refused to reimburse us the repair. What poor customer service - we are disappointed,1
Plates Plates,"Worn tire, the boss said it was sufficient, then 2x flat tires! The wrong battery was given. (2 day tour)
It's a shame, for these prices you can expect flawless bikes.",2
Negative attitudes and poor customer service,Very poor customer service and a negative overall attitude from the staff at the rental store. Employees were discouraging and quite condescending and assumed we didn’t know how to ride. We went with another local tour company that was much friendlier and helpful!,1
Bad service,"We have marked a session one month in advance to 17:00 via the app, which allowed us to select this time. However, we were later informed that this time was already busy and that the app was allowing for more marking. We got a message saying we should be here at 6:00.

We arrived at 6:00, but there was no one there. We tried to call several times, with no answer. Finally, at 6:20, someone attended and told us that the session was actually at 5:00. We explained the situation and the agreement that had been made, but the person completely dismissed what we said.

We are proceeding with legal action because of this situation.",1
TERRIBLE! SCAM! AVOID IT!,"We booked an appointment a month in advance for 5:00 PM through the app, which allowed us to select that time. However, we were later informed that the time slot was already taken and that the app was overbooking. We received a message instructing us to come at 6:00 PM instead.

We arrived at 6:00 PM, but no one was there. We tried calling multiple times with no response. Finally, at 6:20 PM, someone answered and told us the appointment was actually at 5:00 PM. We explained the situation and the agreement, but they completely dismissed it.

We are pursuing legal action over this.",1
Dishonest and dishonest,"First, the address of the meeting point is very vague. We should communicate with a GPS coordinates point! We wasted 10 minutes finding you in the sun.

In the offer, they announce that you pass Padrao dos Descobrimentos (The Tower of Belem) and that you go to the Bridge of April 25. You are not going to the Tower of Belem. You simply make a round trip on a paved bike lane by the water. You pass by no known buildings, no cultural sites.

Also, we booked for 12 but a friend who flew earlier was with us. We asked if he could come with us and the person in charge, who is not the boss, said we had to pay an extra €35 for this participant. 35 €! when we all paid 30 € per person. Clearly, that money went into his pocket, not his boss's.

In short, they sell us a guided tour to discover the city and the Tower of Belem, but in fact make you a 500m round trip on a linear and paved bike path in full sun.

If the young man hadn't asked me 35 € I wouldn't have posted a review on TripAdvisor. But clearly, it's dishonest.

Good luck, though.",1
Enganado. Não fizeram o serviço e ficaram com o dinheiro,"Burlado. Acordei uma viagem com esta empresa e fiz o pagamento de 50% do valor adiantado, como a empresa exige. No dia, não nos fizeram o serviço. Durante a hora combinada estiveram constantemente a dar-nos indicações erradas pelo telefone de modo a que nunca os encontrássemos. Quando os encontramos, pessoalmente, negaram ser a empresa com quem tínhamos falado e que tínhamos contratado. Ficaram com 105€ do pagamento adiantado e não cumpriram qualquer serviço que fosse. Exigi o reembolso, o qual não foi feito. Além disto, não houve emissão de qualquer recibo do valor pago.

Scammed. I agreed a trip with this company and paid 50% of the amount in advance, as the company requires. On the day, they didn't do the job for us. During the agreed time they were constantly giving us wrong directions over the phone so that we never found them. When we met them in person, they denied being the company we had spoken to and hired. They took €105 of the advance payment and failed to perform any service. I demanded a refund, which was not forthcoming. In addition, no receipt was issued for the amount paid.",1
Tourist catch,"Activity sold for “tour of the city” while we only pedal along tu Tagus. Organizer ""john"" very bad, bluntly insulted one of the participants.
We finished 15 minutes early, the organizer wanted to get us down to start the next group.
He will not have succeeded.
Very bad relationship of the organizer who rotted our business.",1
DON’T waste your money!,"Personally think this is a huge waste of money. The staff on the bike try their best, but I think they know it’s a tourist trap with no real feeling of ‘experience’

There was some confusion re the booking time (I’ll hold my hands up to being part of this) the organiser messaged “confirmed at 16:00” not “confirmed for 16:00” or “booked for…” when I booked it was 16:00, so I just thought they time stamped the booking confirmation 🤷‍♀️ but the guy was so short with me and really dismissive, it put a massive downer on the whole thing.

He shrugged that we wouldn’t start any earlier, and gestured we were on another bike (I think he just wanted to make a point).

We started 5 mins late, had a 20min “break” in the middle, where the staff chatted to people they knew, and then arrived back 10mins early. So all in all a complete rip off for around 30mins of drinking/ so-called touring…

The only thing they pointed out was the toilets, no sightseeing…at all

We arrived at 1pm with hours to then spare - absolutely fine as there’s lots to see and an amazing bar/restaurant nearby. Please go do ANYTHING but this bike in this area…",2
Took my money - did not get a tour!,"This was one of the worst interactions with a tour company I have ever experienced. I attempted to book and select a time they not only ignored me but only gave me 7am or 9am as an option for a Sangria and Beer Bike Tour? I had not physically landed so was hoping to negotiate a time any time in the afternoon or any following day we were very flexible. This was for my bachelorette party and we were looking forward to this tour but never got the chance to take it. They took our money and never messaged us back. Would not recommend. Don’t chance it, there are many other tour companies with honest people that are genuinely interested in providing a good service and positive experience. This isn't one of them.",1
They didn’t turn up!,"I booked the beer bike a few weeks before the date & paid a deposit - full communications acknowledging the booking/deposit.
Arrived at the correct meeting point and the bike was nowhere to be found - on ringing it was explained that they’d booked me for a week later. Not much of an apology bearing in mind we’d traveled a fair distance out of the city to the meeting point, with plenty of taxi costs. Offered to rebook us the next day but wouldn’t offer a discount for our inconvenience and also the time didn’t really suit. My deposit was fully refunded the same day. I appreciate mistakes happen but I’d expected a bit more of an apology and discount for future bookings, therefore we didn’t actually make it onto the bike!",2
Terrible Experience with Sangria Bike Tours - Avoid at All Costs!,"I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with Sangria Bike Tours, and I feel compelled to share my negative encounter. My friends and I were excited about booking a tour with them, but unfortunately, the entire experience turned out to be a complete disaster.

First and foremost, Sangria Bike Tours allowed us to book without providing any information about the available times. It was only after we had made the payment that we realized we were in the dark about the tour schedule. This lack of transparency is completely unacceptable and left us feeling deceived and frustrated.

When we tried to reach out to Sangria Bike Tours to inquire about the available time slots, their customer service was utterly unhelpful. We were met with indifference and vague responses, leaving us even more uncertain about our booking. The lack of professionalism and communication was disheartening, to say the least.

To make matters worse, when we requested a refund due to the company's failure to fulfill our booking and provide the necessary information, Sangria Bike Tours outright refused. Their refusal to provide a refund for a service they failed to deliver is nothing short of unethical and demonstrates a complete disregard for customer satisfaction.

Overall, my experience with Sangria Bike Tours was extremely frustrating and disappointing. Their lack of transparency, unhelpful customer service, and refusal to issue a refund have left a sour taste in my mouth. I strongly advise anyone considering booking with Sangria Bike Tours to steer clear and find a more reliable and customer-oriented tour company.",1
Scam,"This is an awful service. I booked it online and was not able to pick a time or date that suited me. The people organising thr bike tour sent me a message telling me they only had 2 times available during my trip to Lisbon but unfortunately neither of those times suited my group. The messages from the people running the bike tour were so blunt and rude and mostly just one word replies eg..""yes"", ""no"".
I requested a refund as my group were no longer able to do the bike tour since the 2 times slots offered to us did not suit but the owner just stopped replying to me. I then requested a refund via TripAdvisor and the customer service for TripAdvisor told me they cannot process the refund for me. This is an disgrace and it has really taken from our holiday. I will never be recommending the bike tour to anyone. I will also be leaving this same review on all social media because it is a rip off and a scam. Terrible service.",1
Need some improvement !,"Unfortunately, our experience with this activity was quite disappointing. Firstly, there was a lack of a concise briefing at the beginning to explain the rules. The person in charge, Diogo, displayed an aggressive attitude towards us, warning that we would be removed if we continued to race, even though we were simply trying to motivate ourselves and have some fun. It would have been helpful if we were informed from the start to drive at a moderate pace and maintain a friendly atmosphere, as it would have greatly enhanced the overall experience.

During our ride, we encountered some issues with the equipment. One of the chains and one of the seats were broken, resulting in a 20-minute stop in the middle of our ride for repairs. This unexpected delay disrupted our enjoyment and the flow of the activity.

We arrived with high spirits, eager to have a memorable time for our bachelor party, but unfortunately, Diogo's aggressive behavior managed to dampen our mood and turned the experience into one we regretted. We sincerely suggest that Diogo adopts a less aggressive approach, as this would undoubtedly make the activity more enjoyable for everyone involved.",2
Really disappointed,We were going there for the bachelorette party of a friend! Everything was booked! We entered the address of the meeting that is on the booking ticket. We couldn’t find the place. We called them and it appeared that the address is wrongly written on the ticket. The couldn’t keep out booking because we were over 15 minutes late… we would be greatful if we could have our money back!!!!,1
Desolation,Just a waste of time....maybe there were 10 people! Better a family bingo... quinquinquin prize less than one euro bingo prize less than 10 euros... absurd,1
,"Very poor, especially considering the inflated price. You have to get there early if you want a decent seat or even just to sit next to friends/companion, and then you are virtually obliged to buy overpriced pizza and drinks while you wait endlessly in a cheap deckchair. A DJ was promised, so I thought it would be lively, but no, just a dull couple playing dated covers. The acoustics were terrible, so it was virtually impossible to understand the film. Everything started late.

Worst? ONE toilet for about 400 people! The organizers blamed the venue, of course, but maybe they should make better arrangements with the venue beforehand. Overall, a total disappointment and waste of money.",1
Respect our language,The place is wonderful and has an incredible potential to provide a perfect night. Shameful to present the show and give instructions to the public only in English. More shameful offer legendary movies with AI. Always whe the Julia Roberts answered “fine” would appear “multa”. And this is just one of many sad examples. We are in Portugal! Respect!,2
deplorable attention,"I was at the Graça garden session to watch Matrix on 17/09/2024. Everything was going well, the place is beautiful, the climate was great and I was going to watch my favorite movie, however, when I referred to buy pipocas, I had the unhappiness of going through with a low, short, yellow hair attendant who could not have been more unpleasant. In addition to serving me with an air of superiority, she handed me a Vacation Package with only HALF of the amount of pipoques, when questioning her said that that bag was bigger but that the amount was right (as I was seeing the other bags with more pipoques). I didn't want to argue, because with this kind of people we are only wasting time, but she managed to spoil the experience that, until then, was pretty pleasant.
Review the people you hire to deal with customers, because that ends up with the good Impression and the work of the rest of the company.",1
Bad experience,"I was at the 22/07/24 session at the barbecue palace and it was a bad experience. Very bad by the way. I was in the last queue because I arrived 15 minutes before the movie started. I sat in a super uncomfortable 'realizer' chair, the staff behind did not stop talking, I heard if the customers of the restaurant talking at the exit, I heard during the whole film the kitchen of the restaurant pass orders and wash dishes, the sound of the film was not strong to get to the bottom, the sale of Ppipocas continued during the film was to hear them jumping from the pan and people crossing the whole space to go buy them. Do not recommend.",1
Disappointed do not recommend,Very disappointed. We had a session reserved and paid for yesterday at 19:30. Received an email at 19:17 informing us the session had been cancelled due to rain. Appalling. No apologies and still haven't received my refund. Will definitely not be trusting or using their services again. Do nor recommend.,1
"Disappointment. The price is very high, not even in the capital. The quality of the food served against the price charged. I considered a r",The attention was very mediocre. The employees argued. We found the price very high in relation to the amount of food served.,2
"Horrible, the French have gone your way","To flee !
If you are French, don't come, the bouncer is racist and will not let you pass under the pretext that there is ""a private party"" when 10 minutes before you could come according to the lady on the phone...
A nice racism towards the French…",1
Don't bothet,Very disappointed. Lots of wasted time idling before and after very short tour. Tour guides had to be prompted to give information. The Lisbon harbor is not very attractive. Definitely would not recommend.,1
Bad image of Portugal,"This transfer does not give us a good picture of the Portuguese population. Aggressive and unkind staff at all. I can understand that time is running out during a transfer but there are ways to address people with a minimum of correction and respect. Respect is both ways, so it is not surprising if passengers get annoyed.",1
No driver upon arrival,"Upon our arrival there was no driver. We had to wait 35 minutes before one arrived. I wish I had called a cab, that would have been quicker, but I had already paid. I would not use this company again.",1
Niet komen opdagen!!!,"Op voorhand geboekt. Een dag voor vertrek nog telefoon gekregen met vraag voor exacte adres en uur. Bevestiging via mail. Maar de dag van vertrek zijn ze niet komen opdagen.

Gelukkig wel via de helpdesk van Viator onmiddellijk een claim ingediend en geld terug gekregen.",1
Keep walking. The Staff doesn't care.,"Let me start with saying the food here was 4 stars maybe even 5 and the prices were good.
Blu is a beautiful venue with a rooftop bar and live jazz we had planned to visit after the meal.
That never happened because the service was awful.
The place was very slow during our visit and it seemed the other 3 tables for much more attention than ours.
Rafeal was polite to our face for sure but couldn't seem to get the orders right.
My drink order was wrong and all the drinks sat on top of the bar for a good 10 minutes while he talked on the phone and checked on the other parties.
The salad never made it to the table but we waited so long for our food we didn't even bother asking about it.
He would also completely disappear for long periods of time and when he did resurface.
one of our parties made the mistake of asking for a second drink.
The dessert did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and then came the check.
She never did see her second glass of wine but it sure was on the bill.
We had really hoped to enjoy cocktails with a view on the roof and our party of 6 was ready to spend more money.
So sad the great food was ruined by the dining experience.
A work to The Chef and The Owner
You have great food and a great venue and that's the hard part to get right.
Its a shame your staff is going to be the reason your going to be missing out on revenue and repeat guests.",2
2 people couldn't make it at last minute. No compromise by tour guide. Information on web site little misleading.,"Over priced for what you get. Booked for 4 people. 2 could not make it at last minute because of travel schedule change. Had to pay full amount of booking.
No compromise from local tour company.",2
"Good tour , very poor guide","First, all of the places we visited on the tour were great. Lovely and very interesting especially Fatima, Obidos and Nazareth. The drying of the fishin Nazarecwas very interesting. The castle and tasting of Jingon was really great. Our tour was supposed to be Wnhlish only and ended up being half in Portuguese. Our tour guide Teresa was dry , rude as md not very informative. She didn’t keep us informed of a delay at the end of our tour and offered little to no information in Fatima on how to acquire getting out religious purchases blessed. In summary the trip itself was good but I would not recommend our guide Teresa",1
Very tired,One suggestion: Change it to: Castle of San Jorge and Alfama neighborhood. Starting at the castle and ending at the Plaza del Comercio would be a good option. The climb to the Alfama neighborhood is long and very tired and it is not that Alfama is as wonderful as dedicating most of the route to it. In the end the castle is done in a hurry.,2
"Very bad, we've been dumped.","Ashamedly, we were three couples and since one of the couples came with a child, we have been left lying without the tour.
The very poorly educated Guide.",1
You're canceled 3 hours early and thank you.,"Beware of this Pseudo-company that is considered professional. Notice of the cancellation of a tour at 6.48 am having the tour in Obidos at 10 am, with the excuse that they do not have enough people to do the tour. As you can tell, what they care about is just money and not offering customer service. DEPLORABLE and REGRETTABLE.",1
Bolt unreliable all over Portugal,Very unreliable all over Portugal. We were given a 50 Euro credit for a no-show booked in advance that caused is a lot of stress. Seemed good until we found we could almost never get a Bolt driver anywhere after that. Uber was far more reliable.,2
Be careful with the Bolt app,"Beware of this app! They misuse it to charge for trips that have never been confirmed. The customer service is a nullity, there's no need to present proof arguments in plain sight that they don't even bother to analyze carefully and logically! Just tap your foot and the customer goes up in flames. What's more, the drivers don't even bother to call if there's a delay or some other issue.",1
"Didn't happen, weren't notified, lost money","Unfortunately we could not redeem our pass because the tram was not running that day (due to weather conditions) so I paid 19 euros and got nothing for it. We were also not informed by you or the booking agency.

Tram 28 not running - we want a refund!,"We booked 2 tickets via this site for Tram 28 for 11:00am on Friday March 28. Our credit card was charged $59.80 CDN in advance of receiving the tickets. Unfortunately we were advised the Tram 28 was not running at all this day!!! Furthermore no one from the company actually showed up at the meeting point to advise us (there were other couples there in the same boat waiting for their prepaid tickets). When we tried calling the 2 different phone number on our confirmatIon email, no one answered our many calls. We also tried to “live chat” for assistance - there was zero response. So disappointed with this service. We want a refund. How do we get this??",1

Third world still in Lisbon,"The third world wrong that weighs on them with the Lisbons. An absolute disaster, huge queues waiting for the trams, they stand still for endless time, they pass the users.....and it is absolutely overrated. That said, the third world is still in Lisbon, unfortunately",1
Horses at work without proper conditions,"Impressive place in the middle of the city and history was also impressive. However, we really experienced the back side of the local people's use of the horses - they were very aware that there were visitors and it felt like there were things they didn't do with the horses because we looked at them. We saw how they used the whistle a little too often to exercise and how they exercised power by whistling as a method. In addition, the horses had very bad hooves and shoes. Most of them wore too small shoes and one of the horses' Hove was even completely broken. So that they arrange Hove regularly is at least not true. They should have a look at that. And that's why they only get two out of five stars.",2
Unhappy with this particular tram ride.,"Wasn't happy with this tram ride at all. It didn't run the full course of the route. I saw a sign prior to getting tram 28 that 28E no longer runs through the full route, so I made sure that I took the 28 tram. Only to find out to my disappointment that the tram ride gets cut short. I was going to try again the following morning, but found out that part of the tram 28 route is currently blocked off. I wish that info was openly available when the ticket was booked. I would have held back on ordering.",1
Appalling,YOU are led to believe this is special 28 tram service when in fact its a PUBLIC TRAM service that you pay 3.60 euro's each as against trip advisers rate of £32 per couple the arrangement to get our tickets was appalling you then wait in a public queue for up to two hours to get on a packed PUBLIC TRAM do not book this service,1

Don’t use this trip,Do Not Use this deal. No one at pick up point when you go to get your voucher. Which is all you get and they don’t accept on any of the trams. Just go to the metro and get your own tickets.,1
Terrible,Terrible service. They signed me up for the following day when I was leaving. Could not cancel the booking. I went to the tourism office in Lisbon and they tried calling them. But the line was not operational and they had never heard of the company and went on line to read about them and read reviews that they are a scam. Took me to another tour operator to see if they knew anything about them and they also never heard of them. Sent several messages to them and never heard anything until the evening in a very rude reply. Asked for my money back and they have just ignored me. I have had good luck with Viator in the past. What a disappointment.,1
Tickets through Tripadvisor,"I purchased two skip the line tickets weeks in advance. The booking company said that they would send me tickets by email 24 hours before my scheduled date.

The night before my date, I received an email stating my tickets were canceled...
UNBELIEVABLE.

DO NOT BUY TICKETS THROUGH TRIPADVISOR.

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE",1
Don't waste your money!,"It was one of the worst experiences I had travelling abroad. I booked the day trip for my mom and I. We made our way to the described meeting point, a pharmacy with no additional information (poor staff members they were lost when we asked them questions). When I called/phoned the company, all phones and mobiles were disconnected. We noticed only after 1h trying to reach the company in 30 degrees heat that it doesn't operate on Mondays (the company didn't make it clear in the booking process).

I had to cancel the tickets as we were travelling the next day, and we were NOT offered a refund but rather a simple message saying 'we don't work on Monday'. I lost 38 euros in a day. Horrible customer service!

Don't waste your money. You can get a daily 6 euro pass in any metro in Lisbon and get the Tram. A small tip: these trams are like a but or metro, so you can hop on/off at any stop with a daily day pass from the Lisbon public systems. You don't need this ticket!",1
Buy your ticket in Lisbon .,"My partner purchased what we thought were two tickets for Tram 28, what we got was a voucher to exchange for the tickets. We were given a meeting point and a time. We arrived 15 minutes early and waited, and waited, 15mins after the time we should have meet the agent we left as there was no sign of them, we had not received any messages and we had no way of contacting them. 20 minutes later we received a message from Alex the agent to say he was at the venue. We went back to the venue and he admitted he had been in a near by cafe talking with people. He insisted we took the tickets which by this time were of no use to us as the queue for the tram was to long for us to join. We are both over 70 years of age and the wait time was well over an hour. He did suggest we take a No 12 tram saying they were every 10 minutes, we knew different as we had waited 30 minutes before and not one tram had arrived. Our advice would be find somewhere near the tram stop and purchase your ticket on the day. as Alex being 45 minutes late in handing over the ticket spoilt our day.",1
"Beautiful palate, poor service from seller",Paid 42 euros for 2 skip-the-line tickets with Audio Guide and ticket refused at the entrance because the company says it sent me the ticket by email (which was in my junk...) and the one in my Tripadvisor account was not the right one...I spent 24 euros more to enter...,1
Very confusing instructions and not worth it,"The instructions for picking up the tickets were very confusing. We thought we were being scammed. After waiting 20 mins a guy showed up, didn’t apologise for his lateness and didn’t listen to our feedback. Then we had to line up for 45 minutes to finally get on the tram. It’s cheaper and better if you buy the ticket directly in the tourist shop. Not worth it. Then we were sent a link for the audio in the tram and it never worked. The tour company never answered my phone calls when I wanted to complain. Don’t buy this. Save yourself some money and go to the ticket area of the tram directly.",1
"This is a scam, just book your tickets at Pena Palace","This is a scam. You can buy the same audio guide for 1 Euro at the palace. The only thing this “tour” gets you is you are able to skip the entrance line into the palace. However if you go early, there won’t be a line.

We booked this months in advance for a 10:30am entry time and the night before (at 9pm) we got a call that rescheduled us to 11am with no explanation. Even at 11 am the line “we were privileged to skip” was not very long. If we had come at 10:30 like we originally scheduled there would have been no line and we would have paid $64 for a $1 audio guide. Not to mention the description doesn’t mention you have to download an app and bring headphones.

Save your money and don’t book through this company.",1
NIce tour but old bikes were not up to current standards,"The e-bikes were old, and the torque sensor on my bike was unsafe. When I stopped and put both feet on the ground, the bike still wanted to go - it surged ahead until I slammed on the brakes. As a very experienced rider, I thought that under different circumstances, this could cause an accident with a less capable rider.

Lisbon E-Bike - it is time to upgrade your equipment to 2025 safe standards",2
Denied due to pregnancy but no refund,"I had purchased tickets for my family and myself for a bike tour in Lisbon, but I was denied participation because I’m pregnant (even though my reservation mentioned my (early) pregnancy, and it was accepted the day before). I was also not allowed to join a walking tour or a tuk-tuk tour... When I subsequently requested a refund, that request was also denied. I’ve now exchanged over 20 emails with their customer service and have received, as an “exceptional concession,” only one-third of the amount back. I am still extremely dissatisfied and believe it’s unacceptable that I still paid €100 for a tour that never even took place.",1
DOES NOT CANCEL EVEN IN HEAVY RAIN - Choose another tour,"***** READ THE FINE PRINT *****. The tour is different than most in as much as it runs EVEN in the rain. It was pouring on our reservation date with the weather described as 'heavy rain'. No cancellation. No refund. Who knows if the tour even went as specified because we cannot imagine how it was possible given that it would be incredibly unpleasant, dangeous, and the rain was so heavy you'd not be able to 'hear' the tour. This footnote in the information section (says tour operates even in rain) is obviously bad faith to avoid refunds, since the operator likely knows that almost all of these outdoor tours usually have rain cancellation. This tour might be great in the sun, but FIND ANOTHER TOUR that offers a reasonable rain cancellation policy.",1
Without an escort Benoît a great experience!,"In itself a nice bike ride. Batteries of the e-bikes run out very quickly despite flat terrain. Tasty pastel de nata... BUT the accompanist Benoît (Dutchman) was a real horror. Arrogant, far too confident, ... . A job in kindergarten would suit him better. We were a group of 35 people (adults) and wish to be treated correctly. The included coffee or water we did not get. Other supervisor Willem was fortunately a winner! Conclusion: 5* if Benoît was not there... something for the organization to think about!",2
Never again pure rip-off no goodwill,"Because the weather was very mixed and cold , so the roads very wet and greasy the tour would have become very wet for everyone we wanted to rebook. In my opinion, safety comes first. It was not an accommodating one, we would have had to pay 50 euros for it. What I call cheekiness.
50 euros for a change of booking.
For me, this organizer is no longer an option. Sheer rip-off.
The local guys were very friendly and endeavoured. But their hands are tied too.
The provider has no customer service.",1
I do not recommend,"The only two photos the driver managed to take mine! Because it was the only two points he stopped. I hired the daily service for one person and during the tour, for two times (lunch and wine tasting) the driver said q had q to pick up other people. I waited and then I still had to pick up an Uber to go until my last appointment which was scheduled p at 17:30 and at 17:10 the driver had not yet arrived. Do not recommend! It's going angry! If it was done well, I'd pay! But it's not!",1

Recomendo empresas portuguesas profissionais,"Recomendo guias e empresas portuguesas uma vez que esta empresa não tem guias e sim motoristas. Mal sabem sobre história,bairros e cultura portuguesa. Como motoristas são bons pq o GPS funciona bem.Sao cuidadosos e pontuais porém não dominam Lisboa em si pois são aprendizes ainda. Se o dono tem conhecimento ou experiência,eu respeito porem, seus auxiliares são free-lancer e fazem bico com brasileiros. Não é verdadeiro que podemos usar nosso horário como gostaríamos pois deve ser feito o que o motorista acha bom para ele...sugiro que os motoristas andem junto com guias para ficar algo mais cultural senao e mais fácil alugar um carro com um bom sistema GPS.O dono da empresa não nos monitorou e nem perguntou se estávamos bem e os passeios como contratado porem o tema do site em que fala Sobre o carinho e calor humano que só nós brasileiros temos não ocorreu comigo. A frota não é de carros Mercedes assim como não recebemos nenhum chip para celular como dito no site...não querendo ser injusto mas comigo o prometido não aconteceu e o meu motorista era um missionário que apesar de excelente motorista e pontual ,deixou a desejar no quesito conhecimento basico de história onde as informações eram errôneas,singelas e desencontradas. Nos sentirmos seguros porem ficou a desejar. O Custo comparado as outras empresas e bem competitivo porem os roteiros são de certa forma insuficientes.Meu objetivo jamais e de difamar a empresa mas sim de ajudar a novos clientes que não são uma Ana Rikman ou Sabrina Sato e sim um viajante comuns como eu.",1
Rather than go back there I become abstemious.,"Bad staff, seems to bother him.
Even in English they do not understand (or more likely pretend).
Absurd prices, 14 euros for two beers without half a chip.
In the bathroom all broken, decadent.
That's bad!
Only positive note: good choice of beers.",1
Most rude experience,"We came to this bar to watch a soccer match, but our experience was terrible. The manager refused to play the match audio because he preferred to have music on, despite the fact that over 80% of the patrons were there for the game. They switched our glass cups to plastic ones, which seemed unnecessary and cheapened the experience. The manager’s rude behavior most of the time did not help either, especially given the late closing time of 4 AM. This is definitely not a place we would come back to or recommend to others.

Sticky floors and toilets disgusting,Awful place. No decent beer. Sticky floors and toilets disgusting. The gents toilet was the worse that I've seen since the 70s. We sat outside but that area wasn't pleasant either. Drank up and departed rapidly. The Irish pub just down the road is a much better bet.,1
Theft,"I was robbed inside this bar on Saturday, the staff were ignorant and did not provide any support and apart from the suspicious attitude of one of them when he said that they had stolen my bag.",1
Don’t bother if you’re in need of a drink,"Awful service. Waited over 40 mins for our cocktails. Shouldn’t ell cocktails if you don’t have even staff to make them.
Nothing British about this place.",1
Good place bad food,"The worst meal I've had in Lisbon.
The steak was too salty and the fries were pure oil.",1
Um desaforo,"No interior há 2 piscinas uma não está em funcionamento mas não existe qualquer indicação no Booking.com ou é dada por telefone… a piscina grande tem apenas 2 locais de jatos sendo que as cascatas não funcionam e mesmo após indicação nada foi feito. Posso dizer que quase nada funciona neste spa que para 50€00 dia fica muito baixo das expectativas.
O hammam tem um cheiro horrível e não tem temperatura certa… a sauna escapa.
Sobre a massagem mais tarde direi… pois ao irei fazer logo",2
Terrible guide,The guide for this tour to Sintra on July 31st was rude and unfriendly. He was not fit to do a visit to the different monuments of Sintra,1
Sintra,"My family and I were there on July 14 around 12pm. I would never write a review about a tour that I was not involved in. A tour guide from your organization yelled at my cousin, accusing her of cutting the line of his group. My cousin did not cut anyone and was simply waiting in line. Even if she had done, so there was no reason for him to talk to her like that he still needs to be professional as he is a guide talking to tourist. When I interfered, he got even worse and did a gesture with his hand telling me to shut up like I was an animal. Having seen that I will never use your organization for a tour. He also kept on challenging me to take a picture of him and his badge, which I didn’t. We noticed later that his group was over 40 people minimum. That is not our fault if it’s overpacked and disorganized on his end…. Shame on him!",1
Warning. Be careful because they can steal from you.,"I bought with this company a tour of the Roman Colosseum focused on children. My two children, my wife and I, were at the agreed time at the agreed site and NO one from the company appeared. Then when I wrote to them for more than half an hour they did NOT solve the issue or refund us a single euro.
Watch out for them. They're irresponsible.
Once you pay they don't answer for anything.
Thieves.",1
Cheap Tour Still Not Worth It,"It’s a cheap tour with cheaper execution. This is a long day and you do not want to be traveling in this hot cramped bus across Portugal. The guides provide little direction as you do the walking and exploring yourself. They do make sure to sell you water on the bus, nothing included in the tour. The main palace is crowded and the visit is quite quick there. Honestly just take an Uber out to Sintra and walk to the top yourself, or there are plenty of taxis waiting to do that.",1
Never visited Pena palace due to traffic jam. Partial refund ridiculous. Not worth the money.,"Due to traffic blockage, we were not able to visit Pena palace, and instead given a ridiculous amount of free time in Sintra, with visit to Regaleira being rushed. The refund was miniscule proportion of the entire ticket. It would have been much cheaper to just do the same trip to Cabo Roca and Sintra by public transport and do the self-guided trip, without missing out on a lot of content. The guides were enthusiastic and nice.",2
Disappointed!,"Chaotic check-in process with no clear organization for dozens of tours starting at same time. Tour started with delay due to road issues on route to Cabo Roca (not sure how these weren't communicated to bus drivers ahead of time). Set us behind for the remainder of the day. Arrived late for Pena Palace timed ticket and had only 15 minutes to tour on our own. Lunch time was not adjusted/shortened and we arrived over 30 minutes late to our timed Quinta Regaleira ticket and were denied entrance. Had to stand in line and entered 1 hour after original ticket time. Taken straight to Initiation Well, then had only 15 minutes to tour remaining grounds, palace, etc. before needing to return to bus. Many hills and long walks - other guests on this tour were not prepared for this.",2
Disappointing experience. Wrong tour and no refund from Viator,"We had booked the full tour with a guide in Italian, also confirmed on the tickets, but due to a mistake by Viator we were included in the group in English. We asked for reimbursement, but were denied claiming it was our fault. When asked for proof, they replied that the case is closed for them. Not serious.",1
Unreasonable lack of flexibility and communication,"I made a mistake and booked the tour for a Thursday, but wrote it down in my itenerary for Friday. With that said, I promptly arrived on site at 8:10, 20 minutes before the required meeting time. I spoke with one of the tour guides, who informed me of my mistake. She was so kind, and offered to see if there was anything she could do to help. It was the last full day of my trip, and I was absolutely devastated. I was looking forward to this tour. I felt like it would have been the highlight of my time here, but instead I was severely disappointed and struggling to hold back tears.

Adding to my frustration, I had paid over $100 for the tour, only to notice closer to the date that the same tour was now being offered for about half that price. The guide explained that since tickets to the site were pre-purchased, accommodating me without a reservation would be difficult—unless a no-show created an open spot. After everyone checked in, she contacted her supervisor to ask if I could take the place of a no-show. The request was immediately denied, with no exceptions considered.

This rigid policy felt completely unreasonable. Mistakes happen, and I had paid nearly double the current listed price. I’ve since reached out multiple times to request at least a partial refund, especially since I never used the service, and have not received any response. I fully understand if the cost of pre-purchased entry tickets is non-refundable, but ignoring customer inquiries is simply unprofessional. Additionally, I would appreciate clarification on the significant price drop—from $115 to $50—as a refund of even $75–$80 would seem entirely fair under the circumstances.

I understand this is a business, but the lack of flexibility and communication in this case was deeply disappointing.",1
Disorganized and Disappointing Experience,"I do not recommend this company for many reasons. They show no responsibility and are very slow to respond — I waited the whole day for a reply and got no help. It all started with a confusing meeting point between two identical fountains. We stood near the wrong one, and by the time we walked to the correct spot, the tour had already left — they didn’t even wait five minutes. The guides refused to let us join at the next stop and told us to wait two hours instead.

The itinerary did not match what was promised. At Pena Palace, we expected some free time to explore the gardens, but the guide said we were leaving right away. I told him I’d stay, and he agreed — but didn’t give me the entrance ticket I had already paid for. As a result, I couldn’t visit any other sites on the grounds.

This tour was a huge disappointment. Poor organization, lack of support, and false promises. Think twice before booking.",1
Go on your own!!! It is not advisable to pay for this tour.,"One hour less tour because the guide returned us earlier. Poor explanations only along the way. There is no time to do anything, I recommend doing it on your own because the transfer is super easy to do and if it is worth staying longer in the places. Lack of organization on the part of the company and tickets were not purchased at the appointed time, which made the itinerary move and we could not know Regaleira.",2
Abysmal Customer Service and Awful Experience,We arrived at the meeting spot 5 minutes later than the scheduled departure time for reasons out of our control. The subway verde line was abruptly stopped due to a medical emergency and the subway service was halted indefinitely. We took a ride share but there was significant traffic and we could not arrive on time. The customer support line at Buendia Tours was rude and dismissive. They offered no remorse and suggested no recourse but harshly spoke to us on the phone that it is our fault and absolute no refunds of any kind. We are very upset and disappointed with this tour operator and would not recommend this company.,1
Clueless Head Office,"We did a Bruges walking tour and boat cruise with this company. The day before our tour while in transit we received an email saying we needed to have printed copies of our tickets. I replied and said we had etickets. They said NO, they needed to be printed. We could not print as we were in transit.

So we attended the tour with no printed tickets and no problem. No other person on the tour presented printed tickets.

The tour itself was excellent by our guide, Maria, but we didn’t need the extra stress when in the end the tour office had no clue.",2
Lazy,Guide was nice however they did not drop the group off at starting point as advertised. In fact it wasn’t even close. It took about 30-40 minutes to get back. So we did not get what we paid for as advertised. They could have easily found a way to drop us off near starting point at the very least. Do not recommend especially if you have mobility issues.,1
Don't book with them,"Lousy agency don't hire her, arriving at the meeting point, they didn't answer our calls, the tour guides who were there didn't give us a solution, they made time pass, and we couldn't join the group I don't recommend anything",1
No good,We came and no one come to pick us. Sitting and waiting at the meeting point but no see anyone … even I don’t know who is my tour guild information and number and no group tourist,1
Misled and Disappointed,"We had a very frustrating experience with Buendia Tours. When we arrived for our tour, we were told by the guide that the Pena Palace and another key attraction were closed. Based on that, we were told we could cancel the tour and request a refund through the third-party platform we booked with.

Trusting the guide, we left—only to later find out that no refund would be issued. We don’t know for sure whether the attractions were actually closed or not, but the whole situation felt suspicious and unprofessional. It seemed like the tour may have been overbooked, and we were simply the ones they chose to remove.

We feel completely let down and misled. This was not the experience we paid for, and we would not recommend this tour to anyone. Extremely disappointing.",1
A flop,"We had booked the trip through Viator 4 days in advance. The weather was superb and we were already looking forward to arriving at the pick-up point on time.
It was our last day of vacation and should be another highlight.
We quickly found our alleged guides, who unfortunately did not find us on the guest list (analog) despite booking code by mail and confirmation. A phone call with the office also revealed no further findings. The guides have already tried hard to find a solution. The bus was hopelessly booked up to last place, the tour in English was also booked up.
We had paid, had written confirmation, a reminder, but unfortunately no place. From the Buondia Tours office there was only a comment that there was probably a system error. Bad luck! We should contact Viator on our own. There was only one service number from America, after further research we found a service point in England.
We were quite served and depressed. I really wanted to go to Sintra. There was no assistance, or spontaneous alternative offers from the organizers.
The bus left and we were left behind. You can't do that!!!
We paid a lot of money for the tour. 98€/per person and no assurance at this time to receive a refund.
We then went by train to Sintra on our own and certainly spent a clear, nicer day and especially a cheaper day there. What we just didn't know was that you have to book time slots in Penapalast and Regaleira.
When we later reached the service point in England, they regretted the mistake and promised a quick return transaction. the money I have now received back 5 days later. Nevertheless, an unnecessary excitement and stress, during a really relaxed stay in Lisbon.",1
Waiting for I r a refund,I booked this trip because I reall6 wanted to see Pena Palace. I was disappointed when my first booking was cancelled and then further disappointed when my rebooked cancelled Pena Palace. I chose not to go and was very frustrated when I could not get an automatic refund and that n9ne of the Trip Avisor phone numbers worked. I finally made an online report. I trust I will get a refund hut I guess I have to 2ait 8 days.,1
No follow up,I was running 10 minutes late and I tried to advise provider with no success. When I arrived at the meeting spot there was noone there. I assumed they had already left but they hadn't even tried to contact me. Very disappointing.,1
Worst touring company.,"Worst company to do trip with . Please don’t go with them .

They don’t answer on phone and they sit in Spain and want to control trip in Lisabon. I had called 10 min ago and was there just 2 min past there time and they denied entry . Also they did not give any alternative.",1
"Unpresentable, don't trust me.","Unpresentable. They confirmed the visit the afternoon before by email, I arrive at the meeting point on the day of the visit and no one appears. I had to demand the money back. They didn't give me explanations or options for anything. DON'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE.",1
Tour cancelled with no notification,"The tour was cancelled due to fires in Sintra. Understand that, but we were given no notice and showed up at the pickup spot. Waited and then called tour operator and they told us the tour had been cancelled for three days.
There were others waiting that also had not been notified. Very disappointing",1
Terrible organization,"I give them one star because I can't give zero.
It was a disaster, the marked link led to another site where I was waiting for more than 10 minutes without anyone arriving. I called the number they gave me in case they had had a problem and were late, but it turned out that they had already left and the meeting point was different. They told me to go buy a ticket at the Rossio station (which by the way, I already paid at the time because it was included) that they would see me there and I would write to them what time I would arrive, well that's what I did and they told me that I'm going to get lost half way. tour, when it was not my fault. I request a refund and they tell me that it cannot be when the fault is theirs since the map link WAS WRONG.
I have been on many tours and excursions and I have NEVER been treated like this, nor has the organization been so terrible. The minimum would be that if only 1 person is missing, they will try to contact them in case something has happened, just like I did with them, for that I have shared private data and have paid a lot of money.",1
Unprofessional,"I took an essential Lisbon excursion, with Elvira.
I took an excursion to be told the history of Portugal, not to be told the political and religious history of Spain…. I already know that one",1
"Lovely locations, but health and safety poor","The tour itself was a surprise, as we thought it was a cruise to the locations, but it was a coach instead. The travel was not too bad, although the headphones and devices were awful sound quality. The locations we went to were superb and beautiful - we should have spent longer at the beach with the church and less time at the other location, in my view. Averio was stunning. However, the main issue was that my husband hurt himself quite badly at the start of the walking tour in Averio - his foot went down a broken drain and he cut his ankle and toe open badly. I asked the tour guide to stop, to help (if they had a first aid kit) and whether there was a pharmacy nearby and she abruptly said 'no' to each request. She didn't even look at his wounds or ask if he was ok. He was bleeding badly, so I had to run to find a pharmacy. I then caught up with the group and we tended to his wounds. We then caught up again with the group. Not once did the tour guide ask if he was ok - not once. This was really disappointing, as health and safety should be paramount on tours like this and tour guides should be prepared on what to do if someone gets hurt.",2
They left me to bring even me begging to go to meet them,"Bad experience! Never again!!!
Me and my 3-year-old daughter left our Airbnb which is 3.8Km from the meeting point at 7:30. While we were waiting for Uber that were all busy, we decided to start walking, we walked a lot, we lost. We tried to get a taxi, they were busy too. I called Buendia to inform her that I was going for a walk and couldn't get a taxi. It was 8:20 when I asked them to wait until 8:45 and he said the guide would only wait until 8:35 but it would be impossible. I ran like a crazy woman with my baby in the neck with pain in the knee. It was awful. When he was 500 meters from the meeting point, the agency's young man sent a message saying that they had already left and could do nothing else.
I asked to reschedule for another day or give me a partial refund. They said nothing would be possible anymore.
I lost 50€. It was awful. My baby only cried when I saw my despair running in this town where I don't know anyone, she was scared. How much humiliation and horrible treatment, and the money was worked out of my sweat.
For never again neither Viator nor Buendia. Never again.",1
Disappointed,"Advertised as English. We were in a group of mostly Spanish speakers. Guide did most of the tour in Spanish with very little English. Very disappointed. I would not have gone the tour if I knew it was mostly in Spanish.

Ordinary,"Bust dedicated to Francisco Marques de Sousa Viterbo, 19th century Portuguese historian, journalist, writer, archaeologist and general scholar. The work, carried out in 1950 by the sculptor Francisco dos Santos, is very simple in design, consisting of a marble pedestal on which the bronze bust of Dr. Sousa Viterbo is placed. The monument is located along the north side of the Jardim do Principe Real.",2
Terrible ride with no conditions,"I booked a boat trip for my birthday where I was sold a sailboat with capacity for 4 people, but I came across a small sailing boat where we had to limit ourselves to the seat. And it's not what the website presents. I also questioned the state of the sea taking into account the time of year and was always told that if there were no conditions, the amount would be refunded or the tour would be rescheduled. However, even with very adverse conditions (very windy and very rough tides), they continued the tour. I found that the boat's skipper was unaware of the tide and wind forecast. Instead of enjoying a pleasant walk with friends and enjoying some tapas and a glass of wine, it was a terrible trip, in my opinion not worth doing. I was disappointed and will never trust this company again.",1
Don't worry,Extremely poor customer service but the flight was cheap. If they treat you bad don't worry they treat everyone like that. If you see your flight boarding and they said you're not gonna make that flight. It's ok many have been done like that. When you miss that flight don't worry if they're not available to get you on your way. Please don't worry it's not you many have been done that way. Just stay calm purchase another seat on another airline. The anger situation doesn't work. Trust me.,1
Never go back there again.,"We went to the store that is close to the castle of São Jorge and it was one of the worst experiences we had. We were looking at the ceramic pieces and more people came into the store, when the lady who works started yelling at us by bed us with pick pockets. My sister started crying, my friend took her passport to show it, the other one didn't understand, and I didn't react. People rushed out of the store, and we stayed. Observation, we were not close to the other people, we were looking at the ceramics all the time at the store. After the lady saw that we didn't go out, she came back and said ohh "" I am sorry scare you guys"" and she back in up saying that was not with us. Unfortunately, she left us traumatized. It was horrible!! we will never go back there and unfortunately; we did not take action in Portugal that should have been done.",1
Aperol Spritz overpriced,"A beautiful interesting place full of life, has really a lot of charm. However, the price of €9 for an Aperol Spritz filled with 8 ice cubes is totally overpriced. Even the nice one doesn't change anything.......",1
Bust,"We were there on a local recommendation. Service was attentive, friendly. Fado performance was good. Eat a bust. Fish oily, tasteless. Spinach not seasoned. Overpriced for quality. Not recommended.",2
Bad food for a lot of money. Singing was moderate,"The food was downright bad. Woman of the house caused fear rather than a welcome feeling. Singing was mediocre.
Too bad about the money.",2
Find another address for food and fado,"Beautiful music with good musicians and singers, only a pity about the particularly bad food. Everything was overcooked, too much dirty sauce and overcooked",1
Disappointing experience at Café Luso,"We went to Café Luso in Portugal as a company of 15 people. Although the music and the fantastic spectacle seemed to save the evening, our overall experience was overshadowed by the behavior of the meter.

We paid 25 euros per person, which included the spectacle and two glasses of wine. Although we asked for dry wine, the meter brought us sweets and, when we pointed out the mistake, he categorically refused to serve us. Insisted on drinking the sweet wine without giving any solution to our request.

The inappropriate behavior of the meter spoiled the atmosphere and left us a very negative impression. It is truly a shame that such a historic place with excellent music is degraded by such service. I would not recommend it to anyone who expects professionalism and good service.",2
To not return,"The menu that is on the site is not the current menu of the restaurant, which is misleading because it works with a menu per person or a la carte options with very little variety and little flexibility. The prices practiced are absurd - 15€ for a mini dessert? The green broth, 12€? The slice of corn bread and lingus described in the green broth is an aperitif toast with a thin roll of lingus. An anecdote...
Although the staff that served us was friendly qb, I did not like the environment. Stressed employees, rude to each other, worried about billing at all tables... the fado was nothing special. Not to come back.",2
Tourist trap,"We appreciated the technical quality of the musical performance. For the rest, no, no and no again. No emotion although this is precisely what fado should convey, perhaps the enormous room does not lend itself to it. Canteen food for the price of a 4*, service let's say ""inadequate"". Truly feels like just one credit card among thousands of other credit cards.",2
A tourist trap,"Our experience with that restaurant was really bad. The manager was grumpy and unfriendly and spoke to us in a humiliating manner because we didn’t cancel the previous reservation. The place was empty until some groups of tourists were brought in. It’s a tourist trap. The food was bad, it was our worst dinner in Portugal and it was overpriced. The musicians were okay, but the first singer, the lady was awful. With such amazing fado singers in Lisbon, her singing was really a shame. We couldn’t wait to get out of there. Never again !",1
Don’t go….,"Tourist trap…food horrible,,worst food in Lisbonne..show was just ok…waiters are aggressive and ask for a tip at the end…..",1
Overpriced,"To be honest, I didn't love this.
I really wanted to feel the authentic energy of a fado...but the experience was underwhelming and overpriced.
The food was pretty bland...and the steak looked grey.
The server tried his best but the whole experience felt cheesy.
Would not recommend.",2
"Overpriced tourist trap, not worth it","The restaurant really was a tourist trap. We went there with a tour group and were served 3 foods and wine. The whole experience was quite poor, even though the music was good, we would not recommend overlooking the bad experience of food and staff just because music was good, there surely must be a better place where to enjoy it. We were served soup, chicken and a strange dessert, I had to ask for the staff to explain what they are serving, our table did not have the opportunity to choose what we ate, we were just served something. Soup was ok, but chicken was really bad, and dessert bad as well. There were around 150 people in total in the cafe and the whole place was understaffed. We had to ask multiple times for out wine to be refilled. Probably worst of all was the final coffee, which was not a real coffee, but served as one.",2
"Brutal treatment, awful place","Nothing justifies a grumpy manager treating a family with two children and two elderly in ways I’ve never experienced in my life. We experienced a brutal treatment, inhuman and absurd.",1
Rip Off for Tourists,"Designed purely as a tourist trap - with its main business being bringing in groups from cruise ships.
Service was strangely snooty and extremely overpriced. Referring to wine under €50 a bottle as garbage. We took the recommendation and paid €60 for a very average bottle that wasn’t even worth finishing.

Recommend to avoid as there are far better places to enjoy Fado without being ripped off.",1
Tourist trap/terrible food,"Tourist trap. The food and service was terrible and overpriced. The fado singers were great.

Sitio para turistas y nosotros pagamos el pato.",1
"Mala comida, y artista desagradable","Fuimos a este local recomendados, pero ha sido una decepción.
Fado en vivo, mientras cenabamos, con una comida muy pobre. El peor bacalao que he comido en mi vida, y decir eso en Lisboa, ya es preocupante.
Una de las artistas, fue especialmente desagradable con nuestra mesa, en dónde estuvimos con pleno respeto con el espectáculo, incluso insinuando que estábamos borrachos.
No recomendable, no vayáis y no es un sitio barato...

Everything to improve,"Absent organization: audioguide does not work with IPhone, no description of the works, dark exposure, ticket office far from the entrance and to retrieve the jackets in the locker you have to go outside and in December it is not pleasant .. in short, for 16 euros you can do better.",1

Don't go.,"I went today. Most of the galleries are closed until September, but they still charge full price. The gardens are a building site. The entrance is not sign posted. No one could find it. The gardens are all steps. No consideration for disabled people or pushchairs. I asked for map of the outdoor sculptures as the modern art is closed inside, but they did not have map. It doesn't say that they are half closed on their website. Very disappointing.",1
"Great museum , substandard cafeteria.","The museum was superb but the visit ruined by choosing to visit the cafeteria. The woman serving was rude and impatient and the food when it arrived was extremely poor. 3 slices of stale bread and a dollop of quince jelly was the accompaniment to 4 pieces of cheese ..... this after a 30 min wait in the queue. Her comments included ""you wouldn't have visited if it wasn't raining"" and ""the queue has been solid since 10:30 this morning"". I'm sorry you are having a bad day but it is not my problem. Very poor customer service and an extremely disappointing end to an inspiring visit.",2
I don't advise,"I didn't like it because the visit was a drought and the guide wasn't pleasant, but it could improve a lot and bring the Mona Lisa here.
And we had to eat on the bench, all wet, I don't recommend it and they don't even allow you to go to the bathroom.",1
Terrible lighting of special treasures exhibit - frustrating experience - please fix this!,"Great museum - been there many times - one of my favorites. But very poor lighting of the Treasures exhibit (with no consideration - not even properly lighting the catalogues!

Wasted money!,"Dont buy at this shop - its a scam!
I bought ""Cali Amnestia"" for 15€. It doesnt look like picture on their site. Its total chemical - in my opinion its HHC.
HHC is made by CBD flowers sprayed with HHC chems.

TO FLEE !,"Very disappointing I do not recommend!!
Despite good music, the waiter (who wears a braid and an atypical style) was very aggressive for no reason!
We were with family and were extremely nice to his very disrespectful behavior, and especially after drinking for many tours, we were treated very poorly. If they have a problem with tourists, they will have to change business and location!!!!",1
Stellion crime,"On 20/07 - I requested the ride from R. Gomes Freire, 179; Lisbon to the airport Huberto Delgado; Lisbon - with the correct cost and debited on my card, from 9€ for a journey of approximately 5km.

The worst public trasport company,"The worst public trasport company in the world. Just forget about schedule, about the information on yellow boards on stops (never correct). Waiting time is twice as long as indicated in timetable. Site is always down or stupidly slow.",1
Rudeness,"Drivers are very rude, they do not give information and if you try to talk to them while they are at the end of the line they throw you out",1
Carris at its worst (as usual),"The panels have information but drivers choose to do what they want. After we waited for the 753 (Plaça José Fontana) in Amoreiras (with a waiting time of 6 minutes), arrived a 753 but whose final stop was the Amoreiras. Meanwhile, we picked up the 711 and asked the driver if it was normal that this had happened with the 753, to which the driver replied: “the information panels are useless.” Carris is always at her worst.",1
"Subway okay, the rest is silence!","The subway is clean and fast. Buses should be avoided, they come when they want and are always crowded. No information at the stops. The trams create nostalgic feelings, but are also never punctual and always full. Unworthy of a cosmopolitan city.",1

Treated shamefully.,"What to say... I have never taken such public transport (buses and trams, the metro works normally). no information, most fanciful schedules, terminal stops at unscheduled stations, drivers who openly mock tourists and who say that in Portugal we must speak Portuguese or go to hell... (this is not in the text but gestures and tone are explicit). A special mention to the driver of bus line 28 registered AH12TB on 26/03 at 17.14 hours. A real shame, we are really the piggy tourists of paying... The number of tourists in Lisbon surely means they don't give a damn about being kind. A bad image of the country and its public service.",1
Poor service,"Basically, the service provided was not provided. Haphazard and sloppy service, very poor information, services cancelled. Hopeless. I ended up going around town in a price gouging tuktuk. On the major reasons I visited Lisbon was to ride the trams. Very very disappointed",1
Very unpleasant staff,"Networks very well connected but very unpleasant staff.
No respect for strangers, let alone with a child in a stroller.
We took the bus, hateful driver, hateful tram driver and worse at the station a lady of the hateful staff and who disrespected us while we asked for help and a man at the agency Carris de Belem (Lx factory) very rude and racist, we asked him if he spoke English or French to facilitate our exchanges and he replied here we are in Portugal we speak Portuguese! To finally talk to us in English and French!
Frankly no respect and very limited",2

It is the scam of the stamp, paid by credit card in the reader inside the tram, 8,10€ x 2pers.

"Very mixed, especially buses","For the subways nothing wrong. For buses it's something else...
Bus that doesn’t stop, doesn’t even slow down to give time to wave, see who doesn’t pass at all. We waited 45 minutes at a stop that at least 3 consecutive buses did not pass, without explanation.
Sometimes 2 same buses follow each other then there are no more for 30 minutes... System to review...",2
Poor service - bus 750,"Bad service.
The 750 line is the only route for those who work and need to use the 2nd circular. Most stops do not have metro available. That is why it should be strengthened. I will find myself forced to buy a car and contruibuir for the transit because the bus never arrives at hours. It's not a 10-minute delay! Today I waited for the bus at 8:58, it was 9:45 when I had to pick up a Uber and give up, in order to be able to get to my workplace. In contrast, at the red cable station passed 4 buses to the martim moniz (location with metro). It is a huge lack of management, is one of the main reasons for the transit of the 2nd circular, there are no transportation. I pay the pass to have to take a taxi to get to work.
On the carris site between 8h58 and 9h42, there are supposed to be 5 buses, so there can be no excuse for failure or accident with the bus.",1

We are looking for ticket price and worth 2.10 per person. When we went to claim, the couple in front of us had charged them the same €10 for two tickets without giving them the ticket. She was offended and gave us back €5 each, had the partner waiting to do the relay.

Fucking G,"Unpleasant, even mean drivers, don't care about tourists.
The €10.70 pass is a tourist trap that is almost impossible to make profitable, and it does not work on the CARRIS company bus between Sintra and Carcais.

Deplorable,"They don't follow schedules, situations in which buses are full are daily, with people having to stay at the stop waiting for one to come that isn't there, therefore not being able to keep schedules if it depends on the quality of their service. Drivers are rude, many of them do not meet the minimum standards for someone who is serving the public. If it happens (as is quite common) that they do not have change, it is the passengers who are left without money, among countless other situations that those who frequently travel on Carris are forced to tolerate, because no matter how many complaints are made, the service does not change and the quality it only tends to decrease. The problem for this company is that it doesn't have competition, because if that were the case, they would realize how important it is to live up to what they commit to with their customers and the importance of loyalty.",1

A must do but way too busy,"The authentic yellow trams are an indispensable part of the street scene of Lisbon.
However, in many places it takes a very long time (for E28 even hours...) to wait in line, only to be pushed into the tram until you can no longer move.

Awful Carris service in serra da Luz,"Shame of you, not enough public transportation, Carris you are so greedy, buy other coaches, you can't treat people like sardines, I like others pay a service and it's our right to have it, it's awful and blizzarw that I miss the bus not because I am late but because inside the bus there is no space and people are pressed together to get inside, I don't even to an animal wish the way you treat your customers. If you want to collect more money in order to invest on it well add more security so you can punish who doesn't pay (also for the metro).
20 minutes to wait a bus in Serra da Luz, there are many people living there and although is not a tourist place it's a place where still there are PEOPLE. I wished soon to buy a car because this situation got worse by the time and it's unbearable.In addition tell to your bus driver to not lie to the customers saying that another bus is coming , when is not true since I waited 20 minutes before another bus showed up. So sad and angry . I don't provide pictures due to the privacy law and respect towards my citizens.",1
Expérience de visite déplorable de l'ascenseur de Santa Justa à Lisbonne.,"En visite aujourd'hui à l'ascenseur Santa Justa de Lisbonne, on a vécu une très mauvaise expérience. Au soleil, 1h20 d'attente pour les motifs suivants:
- organisation déplorable : comme seul le liftier encaisse les paiements des trajets, l'attente pour chaque groupe de touristes est de 20' en moyenne. Il suffirait de mettre un appareil pour acheter les billets et cela irait beaucoup plus vite;
- le liftier refuse d'embarquer 19 personnes- et se limite à 16 pour une raison inconnue; même à 19 personnes, on ne serait pas les uns contre les autres;
- l'appareil pour payer par carte bancaire dans l'ascenseur ne fonctionnait pas. Il faut donc aller au distributeur de billet. Si on est seul dans la file, on perd son tour alors que la file est très longue. Donc, on ne revient pas;
- l'accès aux points de vue au dessus de l'ascenseur est inaccessible. Réellement dommage surtout après tout ce temps d'attente sous le soleil et la vue imprenable sans les grillages que ces points de vue offrent sur Lisbonne;
- si on essaye de prendre des billets par internet, on n'y arrive pas car le site de Carris ne semble pas offrir ce genre de service.
Enfin, après avoir fermé son ascenseur pendant des mois, Carris pourrait offrir un autre service pour cet ascenseur historique qui attire tant de touristes. Réellement dommage et plus que déplorable.
On aimerait aussi un petit mot d'explication sur l'historique de cet ascenseur, cela ferait plaisir.
Quelques conseils :
- achetez-vous un ticket dans le métro qui vous permet de visiter l'ascenseur ou un pass journalier;
- prévoyez une bouteille d'eau fraiche si vous arrivez en pleine journée;
- allez le matin tôt, au moins avant 10h pour éviter la foule ou après 18h;
- enfin, si vous allez entre 11h et 15h, protégez-vous du soleil et prenez un en-cas.
Bonne visite !",2
Péssimo serviço,"Para mim nem estrela merece. Péssimo serviço, autocarros sempre atrasados e ficam horas sem passar.

La peggiore esperienza mai avuta in un ristorante,"Questa è una recensione per la Taverna, al primo piano de Casa de Alentejo.

Premetto che non siamo mai stati al ristorante al piano superiore.

La peggiore esperienza mai avuta in un ristorante.

Eravamo 12 persone tra cui l’unica a capire un minimo di portoghese ero io. Ho cercato di comunicare in tutte le lingue che conosco. Inglese, Spagnolo, Italiano.. alla fine ho fatto la cameriera per loro. Personale maleducatissimo, le uniche risposte che mi davano erano “no” e “in portoghese per favore”. Il cibo mediocre, la maggior parte delle cose sono già preparate in un frigo. Uno dei piatti (maiale) era veramente orribile e abbiamo aspettato moltissimo tempo prima che venissero a riprenderselo (dopo che uno dei camerieri mi ha detto di portarglielo indietro, come se lavorassi li). Non ne vale assolutamente la pena, almeno per la taverna, scegliete un altro posto. Nei dintorni della stessa zona ce ne sono molti di più buoni e magari si riesce a comunicare come persone civili e non con un muro che ti guarda male tutto il tempo.

Diffidate da queste stelle che ci sono su Tripadvisor. Le persone stanno valutando la location, inevitabilmente molto bella. Ma avere a che fare con gente del genere è una cosa orribile, per delle porzioni e una qualità ridicole.",1

Incredibly rude staff and virtually no stock,"Been here several times in 2023 and 2022 - always very little stock and they're now filling the humidor with whisky to make the barren shelves look full.

Incredibly rude staff - the lady with the black short hair clearly despises her customers and was rude to us even though we just said ""Hello, can we look in the humidor please"". The younger member of staff was quite pleasant but the woman being rude and commenting from the sidelines was hugely disappointing and unprofessional.

I've visited countless cigar stores and this is by far and away the worst I've ever been to. Avoid and go somewhere that treats their customers with courtesy and respect.",1
AVOID. More condescending attitude than anything else.,"We went into this shop because my husband is a cigar aficionado. We asked the woman who greeted us - blonde hair, arm in a sling - whether they sold cigars singly, instead of in a whole box. (They are of course in a climate-controlled area, and we could not see them up close.) She said yes, but ""they are cohibas and they are VERY EXPENSIVE."" The implication was that we could never afford them (we are middle-aged and were dressed decently, so it's not like we were college students looking for a cheap smoke). Mind you, my husband has 5 humidors and many cohibas. We were friends with a man who worked for JFK, and my husband has smoked cigars Castro himself gave to our friend. So the condescension and judgment were especially irritating. And it cost them a sale. We walked out. Avoid this place - it's more attitude than quality and certainly customer service.",1
Buyer beware,"Find a great cigar shop in Lisbon to buy Cuban cigars. Only problem was my Siglo 5 cigars (3 tubes) all had plume. If you buy cigars from this establishment, caveat emptor. I would recommend opening all tubes or box of cigars you buy at this store to inspect unless you believe plume is a sign of good aging.",2
DISAPPOINTING. I DO NOT RECOMMEND,"It's disappointing. I usually buy every time I go to Lisbon, and I usually do it from the same origin. But this time for me it was a disappointment, because when I tried it it did not meet the quality conditions; both in grain and ground without aroma, its flavor is altered, strange in the body of the coffee,,,from what I deduce from other occasions bought there, it is not suitable for consumption, leaving an unpleasant taste at the end of the tasting.Da the feeling of being out of date... It gives me the feeling that one of two things have gone wrong or because it is so touristy they no longer take care of it.

I have sent an email to notify it and they have not paid any attention to me.

Unfortunately I will stop buying it at your establishment and given what has happened to me I do not recommend purchasing it there. I see that there are already some similar comments about it. I can say in response that they have given to other people, that I have the knowledge to know what coffee should be like...",1
Superficial or cheating?,"We entered with our celiac daughter and asked if they had something gluten-free, the person behind the counter offered us ovos moles, a typical treat, we again asked if it was safe and she insisted we do not know if out of ignorance or to sell six wafers filled with cream at 11 euros, the fact is that just bitten immediately noticed that something was wrong, reading the ingredients (written only in local language) there is wheat flour!
Ignorance or dishonesty, I don't know but I wouldn't recommend it.",1
Loja com História,"Loja com Historia. Muito bonita e recomendo, mas com a sinalética exterior desadequada para um Portugal inclusivo e de vanguarda, pois mantém os elementos racistas que caracterizavam,em particular, os anos 30 do século XX. Penso não ser necessário manter a imagem exterior racista para continuar a ser uma loja com identidade e de referência. Afinal Portugal de hoje não se coaduna com mensagens deste género que não enobrecem a boa reputação internacional. Esta questão passa ao largo da maioria dos portugueses mas os proprietários desta loja com história têm esta responsabilidade. Não se trata de branquear a história, mas apenas de mostar respeito por quem nos visita. Vejam o exemplo da Alemanha que mantém a sua identidade e lida com a história de forma adulta e construtiva.",1
,"Very, very bad experience, few tables available, we wait by half a dozen behind the tables, people are quite aggressive between themselves, we do not feel well compared to others like in a barrier whether in France or Spain",1
Poor attendance,"Not well attended. People are aggressive. They push themselves for a machine
Don't waste your time in this place.
Disappointing",1
THE WORST CASINO! FUYEEEZ,"A casino that's not well attended, we're dealing with drug addicts, alcoholics and compulsive gamblers. I got mugged because I was on the machine that a regular used to take. The counter was at 0 so logically the place is open if no chair or case. She literally insulted me, shook me and borderline hit me all in front of the staff, as she is a regular I was told to leave the square leaving her my ticket I had put! I refused and withdrew my ticket. The smoking area is not one it is a stairwell with three ashtrays , where I could see a nice Check-out!When I went to get the security it took all its time and other people how to tell you overcooked to react! I'll never set foot there again!",1
This casino treats its customers terribly,"When I visited this casino yesterday, I played a game of Baccarat and placed a bet of €10, not knowing that this did not meet the minimum bet requirement. The dealer inadvertently accepted my bet and only realized the mistake after I won the round. In most casinos, this oversight is usually acknowledged and the winnings are paid out. However, the way this situation was handled at Casino Lisbon was far from satisfactory.

After the dealer realized the mistake, he simply looked at the chips and returned them to me without even a basic apology. This was not only disappointing, but also came across as rude and unfair, which made me feel uneasy. When I subsequently spoke to the female manager in charge to resolve the issue, her unfriendly response was deeply disturbing. She insisted that I should have been aware of the minimum bet requirement and refused to pay my winnings that I deserved.

The situation was further exacerbated by the manager's cold apology and hasty departure. In order to document my experience, I tried to take a photo and share my feedback on Google. The manager noticed my actions and approached me to express her dissatisfaction with the photo. I deleted the photo immediately, but her subsequent surveillance was obvious.

Seeking clarification and resolution to the unfair treatment I had suffered, I went to the cash counter with the intention of filing a complaint. To my surprise, the manager and the lady from before turned out to be in cahoots. They approached me and initially threatened to involve the police, even though I had deleted the photos. It was a disturbing and threatening experience. The two then removed me from the casino, leaving me with a bad impression.

As a tourist, my visit to Casino Lisbon should have been a pleasant and memorable experience. However, losing my winnings due to a small mistake and the subsequent handling of the situation left me with a negative impression. I even felt that there may be an element of discrimination against Asian tourists. I can't help but wonder if I became an easy target for their behavior.

I think it is important that your company's management team is aware of this incident and take the necessary steps to ensure fair and respectful treatment of all tourists. I hope this experience can serve as an opportunity to improve customer service practices.",1
Focus on training certain people directly in contact with customers.,"The person at reception orders us in a haughty tone to speak English when the CNI is presented, without making the slightest effort. Staff training to be reviewed. Fortunately there was his colleague who immediately took over. Bravo to her.",1
Don't go there for a drink...,"Large casino with a fairly large selection of machines. A bar on each floor, unfortunately although there is the choice between several bars, we were not lucky enough to come across a bartender worthy of the name... between the bartender on the ground floor, who when we asked him asks for a cocktail (Gin Tonic and Bloody Mary) thinks about it then tells us that it's better to go upstairs for that, once we get upstairs we come across a young man who straight away tells us he's new and alone, not knowing how to make our cocktails or even a Spritz…
It's about time that a casino of this size in a capital invested in cocktail training for its bartenders, that's a minimum...

As for the smoking room, everything is done to put you off your cigarette, in fact you will find yourself in a service staircase...",2
Mauvaise expérience,"Peu de machines ouverte, les croupiers étaient rudes et ne semblaient pas ouvert à nous aider. Pas un casino agréable comparé à ce que l'on trouve partout en europe",2
Arena Lounge,"Péssimo serviço...empregadas sem qualquer formação ou atenção para com o cliente. Desconhecem o programa que existe. Apresentação/Uniforme completamente desajustados. Sem brio! Aparência sem nenhum cuidado. Sem simpatia, sem sorrisos sem qualquer cordialidade! Afinal de contas trata-se de um bar de um casino e não de uma tasca de jovens universitários! Para pagar a conta o cliente é 'obrigado' a dirigir-se até à caixa pois as empregadas estão entretidas à conversa...muito mau! Tenham brio e pessoas formadas e com vontade de trabalhar!",1
"Overpriced, over rated","In hindsight should not have bothered. Glad I got the bus up otherwise would have been more disappointed having to trudge up there. Overpriced for what it is.

Some castle grounds, not much information associated with them. Seen better castles; some of the outer wall brickwork seem fairly modern. OK you get views of Lisbon on the ramparts but seen that in other areas of the city and the inner wall on the ramparts was quite low so didn't really want to hang around too much on them.",2
Unacceptable Staff Conduct and Poor Facilities,"Met with hostility by staff
Unclean facilities
Definitely unacceptable behaviour from staff. I would not visit again !!!!!!!",1
Place is ok but staff are rude.,"The place is ok but the staff our rude. There are forcing g people w/ their rudeness to leave the place at 8:30pm. Well in fact the place will close at 9pm. Lots of people telling them it’s only 8:30pm but they don’t listen. They told us go & make complaint. The visitors office is already closed, so where can we file complaint of their rudeness.",1
Everything but a castle.,"We're just ramparts. Beautiful as they are, this is never a castle.
The view is not extraordinary, because above the roofs of the houses.
Paying 15 € for it is not reasonable.
I will not do it again even if I return to Lisbon.",1
You’re basically just paying for the view.,Visited here on my own whilst my husband was running the half marathon. Had a 40 min queue to get in an entrance was €15. Once inside there is very poor to zero signage around the castle explaining what anything is. There were areas that were shut including the shop and this was not indicated when purchasing a ticket. In museum area this meant it was very crowded as there was no throughput out to shop so people were going against the flow. The views are fantastic over the city but that’s basically all you’re paying for as everything else is very poor. This is not suitable for anyone with mobility issues due to multiple and at times steep steps and I would be hesitant to bring young children too as ramparts could be dangerous.,2
Disappointment,"It’s not worth the entrance fee there’s nothing to see
The museum inside is fine but lacks commentary on the Andalusian period that saw the birth of the castle
The viewpoint was unavailable and the person who managed the access was unpleasant
It is sun military castle and therefore devoid of all charm",2
Skip it,"Save your money and skip this tourist trap! We bought our tickets online and got there little late during the day. Tickets said the castle is open until 6pm. We entered at 5.20 and no one at the entrance said anything about closing time. We wandered a little and got to another entrance to the actual “castle” where a lady y the entrance told us the castle is closed. Time was 5.30pm and the ticket said castle closes at 6pm. When we asked her about that she said no it closes at 5.30pm!! We stood there and witnessed many other tourists being refused entry into the castle. We went back to the main entrance hoping to get a refund or another ticket for the following day. But the ticket office closes at 5pm! We were angry, disappointed and upset about the whole experience. Either go early or don’t go at all. You can see similar views from free scenic viewpoints throughout Lisbon. SKIP THIS PLACE!!!!!!",1
Just see it from the outside,"Included in the Lisbon Card. We did not find queue on Saturday morning.

There is nothing to see but the walls and towers from which you can observe the view... but after climbing the first tower it is uselessly repetitive to climb on all the others...
I expected it but I was still disappointed.

I recommend seeing it from the outside. If you hold the Lisbon Card, you are taking a quick tour inside.",2
Visit the tile museum instead of the castle,We walked all the way up to the castle only to find that the ticket office was on strike. We tried to buy a ticket online but it didn’t work.,1
Disappointing for the Award,"Really expensive for what it is, if you do not have the Lisboa card or more than 25 years clearly it is not worth the 15 euros. Very disappointed.",2
Disappointment,For the price that costs the entrance I do not advise you to enter.The only good thing that has are the views. Inside the castle there is nothing.,1
A lot to pay for the views you can see elsewhere for free,This castle has fantastic views over the city. That’s about it. You can get those views from other places but this castle has a panorama that nowhere else does. Beyond the view there isn’t much more to recommend it and at €15 per person it’s an expensive visit,2
Rude staff and ridiculous ticketing system!!,"The neighborhood, sights around the castle, and the views of the city from the hill are all great, although it is confusing to find your way to the castle from below and there is virtually no signage. Unfortunately, the ticketing procedures are a disaster and the staff and guards are not the least bit helpful. After being told the wait would be 5-10 minutes, we stood in the main line that didn't move at all for more than 30 minutes. We left disappointed without entering, thanks to the ridiculous ticketing system and rude line management.",2
Disappointing castle with nice views,"The Lisboa Card is a must have in Lisbon. This also gives you ""free"" access to the castle and you can use the fastline. However, the Lisboa Card is so popular that you have to queue for hours in the ""fast line"" and there is no one in the normal queue (to buy a ticket from the castle)... be warned!

The Castelo de Sao Jorge is also a must visit in Lisbon. You can stroll around and enjoy the beautiful views, but that's all. The castle is just some walls that you can walk on here and there, and there is some garden where a peacock walks. And that's all.
Disappointing for us to have to wait so long and pay so much money for views that you can also see in other places in the city.",2
Unfriendly security,"Got the Lisboa Cards for the group. The queues moved for card holders with all the dynamism of costal erosion. The slowest I have ever experienced.
The large bald security guard really should think about whether hospitality was a wise career choice. He was obviously trained in customer relations by veterans of the Belgian Congo. He was the most aggressive rude entry person I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.
Once in the Castle was ok and the girls in the cafe were very nice and friendly.",1
Come Only if you have never been to Sintra's moorish castle,"Rectangular square castle fortress with views of Lisbon. Plenty of peacocks on the grounds but hard to time videos for when they cuckold. If you've been to Sintra Moorish Castle, this castle is a pale competitor and can be skipped",2
Visit to the Castle,"We are 5 Spaniards and we got in line for the viewing of the dark room at 1:00 p.m. in Spanish.
They didn't let us in because there was only room for 2 more people, foreigners who didn't know the language had entered and they still let them in and not us because we were in queue order. They should prioritize people of the language being played and not simply throw them out for arriving 3 minutes later than some Germans.",2
"Don’t bother and save yourself 15 euros, seriously overpriced",Massive disappointment with very little to do inside other than climb stairs and get a view and at 30 euros for 2 people go to Belem and see the monastery and much better sights for much less! Queues in march mean that this would be a nightmare in summer months,2
Not worth the money spent on the ticket,"Bare construction that there is going to be a castle with more than 2000 years, but the ticket is too expensive (15€ per person)
Well-kept garden with many peacocks roaming around freely",2
Good but too expensive for so little,"15€ for a view... (we have the same in Graça for 5€) and an abandoned castle, a museum with hundreds of potteries, and unfortunately zero explanations on the castle itself.

The surrounding area is nice, if you've done Graça before don't go there!",2
"Long queues, little information, unfriendly staff","Unfortunately, there is little to no information in the castle, just a few signs with directions. The view is beautiful, but I don't think it was worth the length of the queue, the extremely unfriendly treatment by the people working there and the cost of admission!! I am very disappointed.

By the way, the ""archaeology"" museum is a collection of shards with no description, the kind you've seen 1000 times before.",2
Not worth 15 euros ticket,Castle is just a standing structure with no information/ history provided tour the self guided tour. You can walk around and go on top of castle for some of the most amazing views of Lisbon. We were surprised to see a peacock galore on our way out. We did not find it worth visiting for 15 euros per person ticket.,2
15 euros,15 euros per person to see views of the city that you can see from any other viewpoint is a bad joke.,1
Not Great!!,"Expensive entry fee, no signage, very slippery, half closed off!

Great views of city but you can find these all over the city, don’t waste your money!!",1
Aggressive security guards,"Security guard boss at the front gate refused to let my tired and heavily pregnant partner and her pregnant friend leave from the main gate, where we had arranged to get a taxi. We had to walk all the way round to another exit. I asked a female security guard thinking she might be more understanding, only to be aggressively told by the security guard that she worked for him, and 'he was the boss'. Honestly couldn't believe it. There were signs saying pregnant and disabled have priority to get in.",1
Too expensive,"Frankly, this is unacceptable.
15€ per person.
Just a beautiful view of the city of Lisbon.
The rest doesn't break three legs of a duck.
Not worth this exorbitant price at all.",2
HUGE SCAM,"To make a walkway on the ramparts in an empty castle where there is absolutely nothing inside without any parts for 15€, I call that theft. This is scandalous and dishonest!",1
Disrespectful entrance guard,"We were attacked by the guard because we wanted to have a little glimpse before buying the tickets, we were well behind the barrier so completely legitimate but he literally pushed us as if we were thieves! What a lack of respect!",1
It’s not Versailles here!,"It’s a fortified castle, so only walkways, empty courtyards etccccc 15 euros!
Yea!!!!!!!!! We are far from Versailles,,,, 🥳🥳🥳 oh it’s not Versailles here!!",1
Rip off!,15 euros entrance fee for a viewing point?! I have no idea why so many visitors are willing to pay that when you can enjoy an almost equally beautiful view for free just a few meters away at the Miradouro da Graca. It would be better to spend the 15 euros on a snack and a beer in the café there.,1
Not recommended,"Disappointment. Nice view but I wouldn't have wasted the time and 15 euros for this. Tower of Ulysses with closed dark room although according to the timetable it should have been open. The guard, despite us pointing out that today is September 30th and it is 1pm, continued to say ""It Is closed"". The rest is an up and down between the rebuilt walls and not very faithfully. Not recommended.",1
To be avoided,"Extremely disappointing. 15 euros are excessive to visit four ruined walls. There is nothing to admire except the view, but I don't buy a ticket to admire the view. Here too a notable queue.
Having visited the Sè we decided to reach the castle on foot. I strongly advise against it, it's torture for the feet.",1
It's not worth it,"Entrance costs 15 euros, you have to queue for 40 minutes in the sun and there is practically nothing inside, it's not spectacular at all
The only thing is that at least you have a decent view of Baixa",1
Disappointing,"Only the walls remain of the castle. €15 is absolutely excessive. Not recommended, there are places in Lisbon that deserve more.",2
Terrible,"I definetely don t recommend this
It s not worth the money nor the effort to go up there
There is nothing to see there anyway just a view like almost every other muradouro",1
Q too long.,Queue too long. Nothing to show how long it would take to get to desk. So didn’t bother to join it. Will get to 100 characters.,1
To avoid!,A waste of time and money (15 euros each). The visits in English to the tower are endless and very few during the day. Spanish and Portuguese only. The staff is few and rude. The incomplete digital guides. Just a few walls and courtyards. It can't be called a castle,1
Expensive,"15€ for a 45 minutes visit. The viewpoint is wonderful, but that price is insane for what it offers. There is not much to do inside of the castle other than climbing steps. You have a lot of vantage points allover the city and for free.",2
Déception,"Vue imprenable sur Lisbonne mais très cher (15 euros par personne) pour voir des ruines sans explications , sans commentaires, sans audio guides. Ce fut une grosse déception. D’autres points de vue de Lisbonne sont à découvrir gratuitement .",2
UN ATTRAPE TOURISTE SUPER CHER,"Aucun interet pour 15 euros/personne à part la vue qu on retrouve un peu partout ailleurs. une queue démentiel car les gens ne savent pas ou aller à Lisboa.
aucun aménagement historique, aucune explication sauf le tout petit musée.
donc les gens font des photos des PAONS décrépis. Oubliez ce lieu et traversser le fleuve en bateau pour vous retrouver sur l autre rive et admirer Lisbonne sans cohut decervelé: ALMADA",1
Terrible - not wheelchair friendly as advised!,"We visiting the castle after checking it was wheelchair accessible.

Belive me it is NOT! Horrendous experience. Cobbles everywhere which wheelchair got stuck in. We didnt even go in, couldnt get up the wheelchair ramp!

Went to tourist information to asked them to call us a taxi, an extremely rude lady simply said NO we dont do that. I asked her for a number for a taxi and was told NO we dont give them put - made us feel like leppers.

Took 3/4 of an hour to get to the to the bottom of the hill where the taxi's were.

Horrible experience wont be going back to Portugal in a hurry. Very rude people everywhere making you feel like a nuicance.",1
It looked better from afar,"I should have read more about the castle prior to our visit. Since it was never renovated after the great fire, there was nothing to see but walls and the view from atop. There are other places to get great views of the city and so many better places to spend one's time. But, apparently, my opinion differs from many others'.",2
Line was Insane,"I purchased tickets ahead to avoid having to wait too long in line; however, when we got there, the line went all the way around the building...it was shockingly long. The people monitoring the line were very rude and not helpful at all. Not sure what the solution is for getting into the monastary without waiting too long. We ended up going into the church, which had a much shorter line and needed no ticket, but we just passed on the long, long line. It was very disappointing considering that I spent 20E on the tickets.",1
BAD experience,Don't buy your tickets online. You pay the money but don't receive te tickets. Buy your tickets at the entrance or stay away from this scamming attraction.,1
Juste pour la vue sur lisbonne,"Visite sympa mais on y va que pour la vue sur Lisbonne.

Les ramparts sont inaccessibles pour les familles avec jeunes enfants. Pas d explication si ce n est juste un pdf à télécharger par qrcode.

A l heure actuelle, le château devrait innover avec des activités familiales, enquêtes, point d informations, ...",2
Aucun interêt,"Bondé, entrée chère pour ne faire que le tour des remparts à éviter. Préférez le monastère St Vincente, très intéressant et accès au sommet le tout pour 5€",2
Poca historia y precio excesivamente alto. Lo único que hay por apreciar es la vista de Lisboa y los pavos reales. Sin e,"Poca historia y precio excesivamente alto.
Lo único que hay por apreciar es la vista de Lisboa y los pavos reales. Sin embargo, dicha vista puede ser apreciada también por un mirador gratuitos a unos cuantos metros del castillo.",1
Trop cher pour ce que ça vaut.,"Faisant partie des incontournables de Lisbonne selon plusieurs guides et sites internet touristiques, nous sommes allé visiter le Castelo San Jorge lors de notre séjour. Et bien au final, même si le château est joli et joui d'une très belle vue sur Lisbonne, 15 euros par personne pour la visite c'est clairement abusif. De plus ne fait partie des attractions visitables gratuitement avec la Lisboa Card, même pas une petite réduction. Il y a beaucoup mieux à faire.",2
Pickpocket in the Camara Obscura,"I'm not talking about the Castelo itself which is well worth a visit. However, I want to warn everyone about the Camera Obscura. Watch out for pickpockets! The camera obscura is a perfect place to get your pocket picked, take it from someone who knows.",1
Con verlo desde fuera sobra.,"Precio abusivo, puesto que lo único que tiene son las vistas hay sitios mejores con vistas sin pagar.",2
Very overpriced,"Tickets cost us around €15 each. The castle had amazing views. However, besides the exhibition, there were virtually no signs. We learnt barely anything about the castle and its history.",2
Not worth a visit - better to just admire it from outside,"Very disappointing. There’s not much to see inside, better to just admire the walls and towers from the outside without paying for entrance. We also paid for a guided tour (the website says there are at least three daily tours), but the guide never showed up. Really not worth the time and money.",2
Prescindible,"Entrada cara para lo que es (15 euros por persona).
Realmente nos hemos sentido bastante estafados, ya que ha sido la entrada más cara que hemos pagado. Tiene un buen mirador, pero no mejor que en cualquier otra parte. El castillo está reconstruido con bastante mal gusto, metiendo materiales que se notan a la legua que son sobrepuestos ahí. Lo mejor, los pavo reales. Si quieres, puedes prescindir de ello e invertir ese dinero en visitar otros monumentos de Lisboa.",1
Mirador caro con pavos reales,"Me parece un precio realmente excesivo (15€) para un mirador con pavos reales ( preciosos, por cierto, lo mejor de la experiencia). La visita al castillo se basa en dar una vuelta por las murallas mirando las vistas de Lisboa, que son más o menos las mismas que las del mirador que hay una calle más abajo y admirar unos jardines que lejos de ser espectaculares como se esperaría, son insulsos, aburridos y mal cuidados (vamos tres árboles mal plantados y un par de estatuas). No puedes pasear por el interior del castillo excepto en un par de salas. Me siento realmente estafada porque es con diferencia la entrada más cara que he pagado y como ya he dicho antes es un mirador con pavos reales.",1
Cher pour ce que c’est,"Très beau point de vue, il n’y a pas de doute, cependant, ça s’arrête ici !
Le château n’a pas grand intérêt, il y a peu voire pas d’explications ni d’histoire, et rien n’est adapté pour les personnes à mobilité réduite ou les seniors.
En somme, les points de vue ne manquent pas à Lisbonne, on peut se passer de celui-ci.",2
Lack of info,"I suppose I'm spoilt after seeing many uk castles
There is no signage explaining what the areas were probably used as.

Only thing it's worth is as a photo opportunity of the city
Very uneven and often dangerous pathways too",2
Risparmiate 15 euro(a persona!),"Risparmiatevi 15 € a persona !Se potessi non indicherei neanche 1 stella! Pochi cartelli indicativi e incompleti. A parte le rovine delle mura del castello(niente di che...), visitate una collezione di reperti di varie epoche(ma niente di particolarmente interessante) e le rovine(poche) del quartiere fenicio,arabo e palazzo distrutto dal terremoto(visite guidate n varie lingue a determinati orari che ,assurdo che non siano indicate in biglietteria, trovate in loco, pertanto se perdete il turno , ciao ciao : niente visita).Per quanto concerne la Camera oscura per me è stata proprio ""oscura"" in quanto non vi sono indicazioni per raggiungerla e poi alle 13 terminano le visite (sono arrivato alle 12,55...)ma, badate bene, per conoscere tale orario dovete arrivarci...insomma una a caccia al tesoro e, dire tesoro è un eufemismo!
Forse per 15€ dovreste fare un po' di più. Avrei dovuto seguire la guida del Touring Club(ottima: mi pare che noi italiani un po' ce ne intendiamo di arte, cultura etc.) che non gli dava neanche 1 stella! Per finire NON RIENTRA NELLA LISBOA CARD! Insomma una beffa!!!",1
Castelo de S. Jorge,It's underwhelming. I successfully skipped it on my previous visits to Lisbon as I suspected it to be boring. The views of the town are good though. Only for a medieval castles afficionado.,2
At the beginning of a century-long work,"The restoration of the cathedral is a work of the century. It is all the more wonderful that it has been started. It will enrich the world cultural heritage because it will not only repair the enormous damage, but will also reach back into the depths of prehistory. What one can see at present is modest. The old-fashioned collection of religious insignia and clothing is unworthy of a cathedral, but the planning sketches of the ""project"" hanging all around are so convincing that one leaves the church full of hope.
Gherardino",2
Horrible customer service,"Stumbled upon this store while walking through Lisbon. I was admiring the antique wood built-ins and snapped a photo. A lady working there immediately ran towards me SCREAMING, verbally assaulting me, the other customers in the store looked horrified. I stood there confused, she then pointed saying NO PHOTOS THERES A SIGN… again, stood there looking around. There was no sign in any language. I even apologized. Maybe someone took the sign down? Who knows, but I did not take a photo intentionally to break the rules. There’s a way to properly address customers and that was most certainly not it.",1
Do not use them,"Would not recommend, they did not take us to all the places listed in the itinerary, when i inquired my dissatisfaction and asked for a partial refund due to not going to the main points of interest I was told ""I should have told them my mother, who accompanied me on the tour was ""disabled."" No lie, their words. My mother and I have travelled the world together, shes in her 70s and walks slowly, not ill handicap or disabled. We have climbed towers, hills, fields, stairs all over Europe. I was appalled. Disgusting discrimination and horrible service, I immediately contacted my bank and explained this to them and got my money refunded.",1

Beautiful Sites and would have been better if….,"The tour would have been a better experience if there was more information about where we were going, how long we were staying and what to expect.

Due to the ticket slots, we had limited time at Sintra and it felt rushed. It didn’t help that the process for queuing and ticketing was confusing and disorganized ( not the tours fault of course!). We also expected an actual guided tour to accompany us rather than drop us off ( perhaps I didn’t read the fine print).

And it was a long day, and suggest tour guides ask and offer periodically rest room stops and beverages. We had a person in the group with limited mobility and the tour guide didn’t specify where the restrooms were and we we all left on our own to figure it out. We did see some beautiful sites and appreciated being driven as it would have been challenging to do this on our own. Overall, glad we had this experience but would only recommend if there were more improvements in the customer experience.",2
A fuir - accident - peur de notre vie,"A Fuir - Accident - Peur de la vie - Notre chauffeur Felipe s’est endormi au volant. La voiture a dévié dans la montagne - mon mari a réussi à attraper le volant avant le prochain virage et le ravin. (Route de montagne entre Cascais et Sintra). Aucune excuse de Celina et Felipe et aucune explication. Ces personnes n’ont pas conscience de leur responsabilité en emmenant 8 personnes dans un minibus et la gravité de l’accident qui aurait pu tuer 8 personnes. Venue visiter Lisbonne en couple, j’ai cru que je ne reverrai jamais mes enfant.

Cemetery of Help,"Camps with displaced singeries.
Weeds among graves

Clearly poorly cared for and without respect for the deceased",2
Shameful cemetery,Unmaintained cemetery that mostly seems abandoned. To find tombs you need to take a catana to find the dead in the middle of the mangal. Shame and lack of respect for the dead and relatives.,1
Closed unfortunately,"Probably very nice but unfortunately it was closed now because they had a lot of damage because of the storm and they are now cleaning this up.

Nor do restaurants let you be inside. We had to eat with high temperatures on the terrace.
Some taxi driver said no with such a small dog.",1
Thieves,"Shit experience, they charge me 31€ for a cut when it’s 16 the base without telling me before, thieves don’t go there it’s an embarrassing place",1
Full and messy,"Very crowded, disorganized, crowded stores, food court chaos

Cachupa for urban bistros,"This week, in a ""gathering"" of friends, I went to this restaurant for the first time, hoping to eat a cachupa ""the style"".
We started with the starters - samosas and corn pastries. I confess that I had difficulty checking from a distance whether they were in the cup, but it was true, they were around 5 cm and the filling of the latter should not have been more than 1/2 teaspoon. Next came the famous braised Cachupa, WOW, on the plate I ate beans with two slices placed on the spot, one of chorizo and the other of black pudding, I was also lucky enough to find two small cubes of carrot, at the end the dessert was famous Kamoca, which saved the meal. At the end of the table they shouted ""Hey, don't be boring, this is Bistro"". UPS, maybe I have to set the GPS for another Cape Verdean restaurant for Cape Verdeans, but without a Bistro.
Otherwise, the space is interesting, and perhaps worth the experience.",2
,"After an unkind hostess DE caisse, great disappointment: not much to learn, immersion / atmosphere well.

Not very aesthetic and not functional,"It is an ancient fountain (mentioned since the 13th century) but whose current appearance is probably due to subsequent interventions (such as the two central bronze mouths in the shape of a horse's head, created in the 20th century, in memory of those which in ancient times they must have existed anyway, given that it was once known as the horse fountain). Structurally it is very simple, being made up of a long limestone wall leaning against a building on the northern side of the square of the same name, from which the water should come out from three pairs of spouts: two lateral ones that throw directly into the manhole covers and a central one (the one with horse heads) which feeds a low basin. The water does not come out of any spout, although perhaps at least the power plants should work occasionally, given the presence of water in the tank.",2
Source without water,"It is a well-known spring, but not beautiful, which has no water and has no signs of having recently.
It was built between 1753 and 1754, has four tubes and is divided into two spaces: the first on the highest floor, with two tubes, intended for people, and the lower part with the remaining two tubes, with water that was the remains of the upper part, served as a drinking place for animals.

It doesn't work and the context doesn't help,"Eighteenth-century baroque fountain in a corner of the square, between rua do Salitre and rua da Escola. Quite imposing but with a not particularly elaborate structure: against a wall, above which a private garden seems to extend, it begins at the top with an apparently empty aedicule, under which is the display of the fountain whose cornice is decorated with three vases ; against the lower part of the exhibition there are two small semicircular basins which collect water from two spouts; this first sector of the fountain rests on a terrace equipped with a parapet and which is accessed via two lateral staircases; at pavement level, attached to the base of the parapet, there is a rectangular basin with rounded corners which collects water from two spouts above. The fountain, in addition to having a modest artistic level, is dry and non-functional and the tanks become a receptacle for rubbish. The surrounding context, then, certainly does not contribute to enhancing the fountain, given that we are in Largo do Rato, which is a complicated and very busy intersection of many roads.",2

"Service not provided, poor experience","Booked the day of the experience and that went smoothly. Afterwards, waited for few hours for the business to open at 9 am so I could hear from them and discuss the plan. The experience was supposed to be custom for my family. No call/ message came through. I called the number and the guy just kept saying to wait for WhatsApp message. Kept saying to check if my WhatsApp is working and just insisted there has to be a problem at my end. When I told him that was not the case, and I was not having him tell me the issue was mine, he just hung up!! I then did not have the heart to call him again. I called trip advisor. They said someone should send me a message and I did indeed get a message. However, this person was now driving a tuk tuk and was too busy to set up a plan. He asked for few minutes. Some 40 mins later, I asked him to give an update and nothing happened. He did offer to pick us up from our hotel at 4 x the price of a regular taxi service in Lisbon (Bolt). I said we can just take the taxi as we have a baby too. We could then meet him at the historic center. No further response from him.
I intend to dispute the charge through my credit card company. However, the point is not the money. I paid a little over $42 for a half hour of tuk tuk.
We then just set out on our own and found an amazing guy who took us around for half that price and showed us around the major attractions on a 1 hour tour.
The point is just that this was a terrible experience and I do not recommend to any one else. You can easily go to historic area and negotiate the price that is suitable (50 euro for 1 h is easily doable). No point in and",1

Awful.,"Dreadful! It was the only disappointing part of our whole 2 week trip to Portugal. Not Eduardo’s fault but the fault of the owner who is a pure scam artist. Beware! This company is a scam. We paid the €20 for the initial 20 minutes understanding from the website that it was ‘fully’ customisable and that we could extend for as long as we wanted to pay. NO. Upon arrival we were told that as we had only paid for 20 minutes that is all we would get. I called the owner and stated that is not what is advertised. Basically he had another client that he wanted to give the business to and so we got dumped. Eduardo took us to ONE viewpoint which alone took 20 minutes, no return to our starting point and no Portuguese drink as advertised. I asked the owner for the money back but he refused. Also note that after the first 20 minutes you are charged €20 for each we minutes thereafter which = €60 for one hour - almost double or triple other companies. Total scam artists. I am so angry I will be writing bad reviews about them for a LONG time to spare other visitors the agony. Avoid this company!",1

Not worth the hassle with this specific company,"I couldn't locate the person. I tried asking other Tuk Tuk drivers and none knew who my driver was. I finally found someone who could have been my driver, but when I finished asking his name all he said was ""You're my client?"" And walked away. I'm not sure if that was my actual driver or not, but either way the experience of walking around with my heavy travel bag and being embarrassed that I not only couldn't find my driver, but had another one walk away and having me make the assumption that he was my driver and didn't want anything to do with me, embarrassed me, flustered me, and was making my Lisbon experience horrible. If it hadn't been for this other absolutely amazing person who also did Tuk Tuk tours (no correlation to this company) I would've been severely disappointed with my experience with my 1st visit to Lisbon. Would not recommend this specific tour company unless you want to walk around aimlessly searching for your driver. Also, as a side note, there was no language barrier to use as an excuse as Portuguese is my first language and English is my second. Therefore there was no way anything could've been ""mixed up"" in the translation process.",1

Unfortunate and scabrosa situation at the bar/restaurant,"At the Cinemateca Bar/Restaurant, a historic institution, funded by the taxes of all of us, I was served a Tonic Gin that was basically made up of (big) ice stones.

After complaining about what happened, I was told that a fixed measure of gin was used, and that there was nothing that could be done. Having this in mind, I ordered the complaint book, which I received without a pen. When I asked for the pen to fill in my complaint, it was denied.

When I was denied my pen, I announced that I refused to pay for a Gin made up of ice stones, and I left, promising never to come back.

I write this complaint as a form of warning, for what this episode illustrates about Lisbon and the life it offers to the few Portuguese who still live and/or try to attend it.

The Cinemateca was an anchor of the city, a space for debate, where artists and intellectuals met. Where the classics of the history of cinema were made available to the population, and each visit was taught

Today is something completely different, permanently full of tourists, the bar/esplanade has become a place where maximizing profits prevails. This maximization of profits implies minimizing the well-being of the places that attend it, and the quality of what is served to them, as my example can illustrate.

This would already be bad enough, but it would become even worse because we are talking about an institution financed by the state, and by the taxes of all of us, taxes whose collection, for situations like these, becomes increasingly difficult to justify.",1
"very hot room, uncomfortable for 3 hours of film","Yesterday I went to see the Oppenheimer film, which lasts 3 hours, the room was full, the seats are not the most comfortable and the room was hot like a sauna, very uncomfortable, it wasn't really a good experience, I just wanted the film ended as quickly as possible, but there it was 3 hours in the sauna, with lots of people using the boxes of popcorn to act like a fan, anyway",2
Take your money...,"I do not recommend. For the price is not justified at all. It's the second time I'm going. The first time the film was delayed because there was a giant queue in the only rollot that existed inside the grounds to eat, and there were no big options nearby (it was below the April 25 bridge, in the climbing zone). I went again at 07/2025. The venue of the event was changed after the purchase of tickets, which I did not like. It was at the naval dock in Lisbon, there was a bad wind, I could only hear the carripana engine that gave the energy for the transmission of the film all the time. In addition, the bathroom was more than 100 meters away and there was no light or way to lock the door. The organization is always bad, save your money and watch the movie at home, where you will be 100% more comfortable and you will not have to walk 5 minutes to go to the bathroom. There are better outdoor cinema options that are not at this ridiculous price and with this bad organization.",1
Not worth the money,The idea of a cinema outside in a nice location is good but the way this has been setup is not good at all. The screen is way too small for a cinema feeling if you are sitting past row 5 and the chairs a pretty uncomfortable. The worst thing however is that the bar next to the location keeps playing loud music which you hear a lot. Overall this event should spend more money in the experience and less in marketing. For us it was definitely not worth the money.,2
Hugely Disappointed!,"Having seen reviews and advertising online as the rooftop open cinema set amongst the traditional Lisbon city back drop I thought this would be an unique experience. It was definitely unique and for the wrong reasons, I arrived to a projector screen with the back drop of a side road and people parking cars dumped on the end of the patio for the ritz hotel. Hugely disappointed, don’t be fooled by the photos and locations you see online you won’t be getting that.

The boat trip in Aveiro is amusing (good boatman), but there is no sign of Venice feeling. There is no time to visit Aveiro. We booked English, 3/4 was Spanish! The guide Christina, spoke monotonously on the bus all the time, asleep! The tour would have to last at least 2 hours longer and offer guides who have substantial say. Absolutely not a recommendation! Not worth the money!",2
"Disorganized, Misleading, and Inconsiderate – the Gray lines - A Tour to Avoid","We booked the Grey Line Lisbon tour hoping for a comfortable, informative experience. What we got instead was confusion, poor planning, and complete disregard for guests’ needs—especially those with mobility issues.

The tour began poorly: we were picked up from our hotel and dropped off in a parking lot, where we waited over 45 minutes for the buses to arrive. There was mass confusion and almost no communication from the Grey Line staff.

Eventually, we boarded a packed bus and drove toward Pena Palace. We were told we’d be taken halfway up the mountain by bus—this part was overcrowded and uncomfortable. Once dropped off, we were forced to walk a steep uphill section to the palace entrance. After reaching the top, we then waited 30 minutes in a tight, crowded space before being allowed inside.

The palace visit itself was just as disappointing. The guide, Mariza, gave very minimal information—first in Portuguese, then English—and once we got off the bus, she remained with the vehicle while we were left completely on our own to explore. She provided no history or explanation of the palace or its significance, which was a major letdown.

After the visit, I asked where the bus was to take us back down the mountain, as she had originally stated. She told me flatly that no bus would be coming and that instead, she would lead us on a “shortcut” down the hill—claiming it would only take six minutes. I asked again if my wife, who has a bad knee, could take a bus instead. She said no.

The walk down was steep, uneven cobblestone—treacherous and painful for my wife, and very difficult for anyone with mobility concerns. The guide showed no empathy or flexibility, and we felt abandoned and misled.

To make matters worse, we had also been told that headphones would be provided so we could clearly hear the guide during the tour. These were never provided.

Overall, this felt more like a disorganized shuttle service than a guided tour. If you value your time, comfort, or accurate expectations—avoid this company. This was a stressful and unpleasant experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone, especially seniors or those with any physical limitations.",1

Stay off the Lisbon Hop On Hop Off Bus,"Took the Gray Line Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour. Avoid.

The double deck busses are partly open on the upper level but are not air conditioned either upstairs or down.

The busses are too big to negotiate the inner core of Lisbon so the route mostly passes through the unprepossessing and graffiti strewn inner suburbs. These areas look any other southern European city. Street after street of mid rise apartment blocks with the occasional public park.

The highlight of the trip was to have been the monument to the discoveries of the early renaissance and the Belem Tower. Be aware that both these monuments are in semi industrial zones and bordered by busy railway lines that detract from any sense of history or grandeur. Also at the time of writing, June 2025, the Belem Tower is shrouded in scaffolding.

This bus tour is a waste of time and money. Avoid",1
Disappointing,"Our guide was knowledgeable and energetic. However, the group included people speaking different languages, so much of the time was wasted.

Nobody provided any narration of what we were looking at, as the guide didn’t join us on the boat.",1

Rushed,"I was quite disappointed with this tour. I had been looking forward to visiting Fatima for many months. I chose this tour as it was self-guided, however, I guess I naively assumed I would be provided with some written material and/or maps, which I wasn’t. Before we even arrived at Fatima, we stopped unexpectedly at an overpriced coffee/souvenir shop for 30-45 minutes, time that would have been better spent at Fatima. We arrived at Fatima at 1045 and were given a very brief overview before being left on our own and instructed to meet back at 1245. I visited on a Sunday and wanted to attend mass which started outdoors at 1100. Beware that the outdoor Sunday mass can last from 1 1/2 to 2 hours, almost the entire time that is allowed to explore. Since I wanted to attend mass, my time was very rushed and I didn’t get to see all that there was to see. When we met back at 1245, we were informed there was not enough time to visit the children’s village home. This was extremely disappointing as I was really looking forward to seeing it. I now understand that Sundays are busy, but perhaps there should be some mention in the tour description of this and that because of this the itinerary may not be fulfilled. I feel that my Fatima experience, although good, was not what it could have been with this company. I missed out on a lot and because of that I feel the tour operators failed me as a customer. I would not recommend this tour company if you want a fulfilling visit to Fatima.",2
Shocking Company,"Travelling with my elderly mother and my brother, we purchased the basic hop on/off tour. We had already independently been to Belem and just wanted to see a bit more on the other side (Blue Line) of where we were staying. Tickets were bought directly from the ticket office. We were offered no information as to where we should go, and it was chaos around the bus stops. Turns out that several different companies leave from the same place. You are hearded onto the busses, none too politely by completely disinterested staff. You then set off on what is supposed to be a SIGHTSEEING tour!!! Well, if you consider driving slowly through rundown areas on the equivalent of A-roads/motorways, then by all means, waste your money! The ONLY bit of actual sightseeing (and I use the term losely) was the Vasco Da Gama bridge.
The 'tour' took close to two hours until the bus broke down by the zoo! We were left to find our own way back or opt to wait 30-50 minutes for the next tour bus to pass.
This company is a horrendous tourist trap. Avoid like the plague! I expect the only reason they run this 'tour' is that it conveniently has its own stop by the cruise terminal.
A £65 mistake which, regrettably left a bad taste after a super holiday in Lisbon.",1
Better go!,"We have already done hop-on/hop-of bus tours in some countries, but we are disappointed with Lisbon.

No accommodating the employee when we brought it up... just a cheeky response and that was it. D.h. We paid 2 days, but only used 1 really. I think it's pretty outrageous!

Greyline Lisbon Hop On Hop Off is Horrible!,"Taken many hop on hop off bus tours in many countries and this was by far the worst. I wrote the company to make sure that the bus went to Cascais, Lisbon. They wrote me back to say that I should be at the tour meeting place at 9am to go to Cascais. I got there at 8:45 am only to find that the tour left at 8:30 am! I then went on the Belem tour where the audio did not work for the first 15+ min. I got back for the Cascais tour only to find that the audio on the second bus did not work ever and the driver did not announce the stops. Because I missed the 1st tour to Cascais, when I new there would be no rain, when I got to Cascais it was raining so hard that I could not walk around the town. I was so disgusted with the tour bus company that I took the train back to Lisbon, so I wouldn't waste any more time with a company that has defective equipment and doesn't communicate accurately.

The guide stayed on the bus at the Belem Tower, the Monument to the Discoveries and the Jeronimos Monastery. She did not tell us where we could buy tickets for the monastery. She took us around the palace and spoke in a monotonous voice. To me this would only be interesting if you had a good background in the history of the Portuguese Royal family. It would have been more fun and cheaper to take an Uber and walk to the first three places and purchased tickets to the Monastery on our own. We were very disappointed.",1
To flee,"Very poor service: expensive, headphones that do not work on half the seats, stupid drivers, missed and limited hours (last bus at 5:30pm).

overpriced,"The time was not well distributed over the different places and the entry for Batalha was not included (also there would not have been enough time to enter). The guide was really nice but he just gave information in the bus and did not accompany us in the places as well, which I think would have been nice in Fatima for more infermation",2
Company needs to sort out their equipment.,"We arrived at cruise terminal and delighted to see a stand to enable us to buy tickets for the Hop on Hop off bus tour of Lisbon. Queued for tickets and were directed to bus number 3052.
Joined another queue as people were purchasing tickets on the steps of the bus. We were not allowed on but had to wait in line even though we had tickets.
Sat upstairs and tried to connect to the commentary however the unit was so worn it was impossible to see the screen and pick the language. We had to wait until other passengers left so we could move into their seats.
The tour itself was ok, usual hop on hop off bus commentary and local music, but it gave us a feel for the place and an idea of places to visit.
A better way of loading passengers is needed and someone needs to check and replace faulty equipment. This is the start of the season - get your act together.",2
Unfortunate waste of money,"Very disappointed. Paid for a 72 hour ticket and halfway through the second day was told our tickets were not valid. Drivers in general were rude and when I let one of them know that he did not stop long enough for us to even unplug the headphones to exit he just said he did not speak English. The stories were unclear and filled with company advertisements while many did not match our locations, nor did a few of the stops match where the map said we would be. We never were able to find the boat tour and could not catch the blue line because it ran so infrequently. While waiting at a stop for over 20 minutes for our bus, another company had 3 busses stop. Overall, it was an unfortunate waste of money.",2
Cascais with unexpected break,"Careful when you go to Cascais.

There is a schedule on some of the buses outside, but it is not transparent.

You should not get stuck on the bus during the Cascais tour and do the tour as a round trip without getting off, as is possible with other tours, e.g. restricted persons or in bad weather.
The bus stops at an unattractive parking lot for at least 30 minutes. You don't know anything about it, nothing in the papers, no announcement, nothing. After some waiting time asked the friendly bus driver and learned about it with hands and feet, but then it was too close to take advantage of the unexpected break.
At least 10 people on the bus felt the same way, 'waste of lifetime'.

Too bad the tour and also the other tours are good.

Beware, the Gray Line bus is also red and easy to mistake for the red line.",2
Disappointing,"TIME & INFORMATION - Very disappointing...We were told the 32euro price was good for 48 hours instead of 24 (on brochure) and, all of the three routes in Lisbon.

While on the red route, much of our time was spent waiting at the various stops and the audio not working either.",1
"Poor quality, bad driving. Quite scary.","Purchased 2 tickets for the Red and the Green hop-on and hop-off bus tours, thinking it was a different company. Similar bus livery, several people were caught out trying to get on the wrong buses.

Commentary was almost non-existent, and what there was would suddenly stop to announce a stop and then not resume. Badly out of sync with location, with random announcements about a place with no indication of where it was e g. ""The British Cemetery"", various statues etc.

I was an aficionado of folk music and of Fado before this trip. I am now cured. It was over played through all journeys.

The quality of driving was abysmal, hurtling around narrow streets and sudden braking as a result - especially the green route. Incredibly uncomfortable and quite scary. I saw quite a few passengers reaching for their seatbelts.

Use the other company.

NB - didn't do the boat trip - this is about the Castle and Belèm routes only. Definitely avoid the Castle route if you're not in possession of valium.",2
Hop on Hop off Lisbon Sightseeing Gray Line 2024/2025 by Marques de Pombal!,"Blue-eyed we unfortunately bought two full-day tickets for one day from a lady who approached us at the Marques de Pombal! for all lines! (red, blue, green, grey)
Actually, we had to transfer several times on each bus, as it was hardly possible to find 2 working headphone ports in a bench next to each other.
At a price of Euro 64,- for two people that would probably be the minimum that should work! on a sightseeing tour! Unfortunately all buses obsolete, not working, cheaply equipped, and out of date for 2024!!!
With the red line we stood/waited a felt 20-30 minutes somewhere at the port! No idea why!? No info on that!
At the green Castle Line, very strenuous driver!! we all got wet unfortunately, because it was not possible to stay dry during a short downpour!
This day with Cityrama Gray Line was by far the worst in Lisbon!!",1
Bad service,"It was a terrible service. The buses DO NOT follow the given time tables, they came more than 20 minutes late and also for example, in the Cascais line, it said it left Cascais at 11, but it didn’t. On the other than, they don’t follow the lines or the routes, again in the Cascais line (took it on the 9 am Saturday 12 of December) the bus didn’t stop at 6 or 7 stop, it just turned around and didn’t finish. Also, the ground staff are rude and even though you kindly ask questions? They just look at you like you are bothering them.",2
Dire end,"I denounce that at the end of the Sintra excursion today, November 28, 2024 and after the end of the excursion the bus did NOT take us back to the Hotel Márquez De Pompal in Lisbon. The Lady Guide named Dorita took us off the bus on avenue away from our hotel and we had to walk back without knowing exactly where the hotel was. I consider that we pay for hotel pickup (which you did in the morning) and drop us off at the hotel upon returning from Sintra, which you did NOT. It is an unpleasant behavior for a tourist so it must be condemned and not repeated.",2
Horrible,The tour was in 4 languages so you got maybe one sentence about a place and then they moved on to another language. The 2 photo sites were pretty. The guide was monotone and so unengaged. At the monetary we weren't told how to get tickets and by the time we figured it out we had to leave. It turns out the church is free to enter but was under renovations which was also not shared with us at the time. The national Palace was not worth the time or money. All in all a very frustrating and unsatisfactory tour. I would avoid this tour.,1
"Rubbish,thieves not worth the money","This firm is rubbish I purchased the two day hop on hop off tick at the Cruise terminal from Gray line
The first part which due to traffic takes half an hour takes in nothing no sites to see
On reaching the change over point to get on to the purple line I asked the driver a question he turned out to be very difficult, ignorant and just said get of the bus.
The purple line bus was over half an hour late arriving at the change over point when we got to stop 7 we asked this driver when the next bus was he said one and a half hours. We duly turned up at the bus stop 15 mins early only to find the buses had stopped running,we had to get an Uber back to the Cruise terminal
There were no representatives available at the Cruise terminal the next day to take this up with.
On contacting Gray line they told me I should have downloaded the winter bus times (we were not informed of this)
On speaking to the normal red hop on hop off bus representatives they said that Gray line always have this problem and the reps do not turn up on day two
Do your self a favour and don’t use Gray line they are rubbish and refuse to reimburse me my bus ticket price and Uber cost
USE THE NORMAL RED HOP ON HOP OFF BUS",1
Blue Line rip off,"The gray line blue line is a rip off, very little narration mostly music. Driver rude when I asked why there was no talking, just music he told me to write a complaint and blurted out a number. Apparently I was not the first to express a concern. Lesson learned don’t pay for the Blue line on Grayline.",2
Make Another Selection,"The bus was never on schedule, we waited over 45 mins to board the first bus of the day only to go 2 miles and sit for another 20 minutes. Very unorganized, not reliable, and they waste a lot of your time just sitting on the bus in one location. There are several other tour buses in this city, try them, the red bus seems more frequent and organized... may have more buses or something.",1
Steer clear and never again,"steer clear....headphone narrating - hard to hear and understand.
hop on and off a joke. was a cruise port stop. wanted to go around once to get my bearings - also a joke. was dropped off 1/2 way and instructed to wait to catch the next bus for part 2 of the tour before they would take me back to port. caught taxi and went back to ship instead. it was a miserable way to spend
my 1 and only day in Lisbon and I am still angry about it. will never use greyline no matter what country or city we are in and i am telling all my friends.",1
Sightseeing with Gray Line not recommended!,"We've all done routes. Audio accompaniment was not satisfactory: little informative, there were several repetitions on the routes, the narratives were often aborted by the stops and many connections did not work.
We recommend switching to one of the other sight seeing companies!",1
inappropriate and impersonal,"The audio commentary of the bus, recorded with a robot voice, is almost always started late. In any case, the density of Old Port monuments does not leave enough time to describe them... I think this type of visit is not suitable for such a concentrated center. The rest of the way (75%) is full of empty space with a round trip to the port without any valorization of it. It really feels like a filling...
As for the boat tour, you will have to remember to take headphones and download an app to have information... Welcome to the world of robots!",1
Not recommended,Far too little time for the individual stations. That's how you just rush through everywhere. Less would be more. I'd rather delete 1-2 points and please more info on the bus. Not just explaining where we're going. It's not worth it that way.,2
Poor service in Porto,"It was one of the worst experiences we had on tour buses. We bought tickets for 48h but in these 48h we used 4 times (in 3 days, since we activated the ticket on the first day at 14:00). The stops are insufficient for the historical or interesting sites to visit, we walked a lot from one place to another or because there were no stops in the areas of interest or the buses took a lot of time. Not to mention the changes to the routes that even the drivers themselves, street or store sellers could not inform. It was a disgrace and I feel out of the 50 and so euros that I paid for 2 tickets to visit the harbour, because I still had to use Uber a few times because the buses were late.",2
Don't,"Poor value for the time and money. Use city transit instead. Translation headphones didn't work for the first 40 minute ride from the cruise pier to the central plaza. Waited 30 minutes more for the connecting bus to the western sites in the city. Lisbon traffic and narrow streets kill forward progress and timekeeping. If you are off a cruise ship consider alternative transportation. We rode $35x2 HopOnHopOff Red to our first site, then opted for city bus 714 and tram 15E for just $5 to get back, faster.",1
Really bad!!!,"We booked 2x for 3 days+tickets for ocenarium and at the second day we came maybe 10 minutes before the bus needed to come and we ended up waiting another 45 minutes. No bus came, we called the central they were answering like they dont know and the bus driver also. Really bad experience. You pay that much money and get to wait that much.👎🏻👎🏻",1
Very dissapointing experience,"We have bought 4 tickets for adults for 3 lines tour for 48 hours. Terrible scheduling , not on time buses. But the worst thing is the actual audio guide. They do not give any information about the city, monosylabus sentences about several lanmarks. Surely the city deserves some respect and have a lot to say for itself! the majority of time it is music in your headphones. Extremely dissapointed!!! The app which supposed to show you live busses location is inaccurate.",1
"Boring, No info and Rude Drivers","We were really excited to arrive in Lisbon on our cruise as to us it was the highlight of the holiday. To make the most of Lisbon we decided to pay for the Grey line tour. After waiting around half an hour to depart we made our way through heavy traffic into Lisbon. Whilst making our way there was a number of close calls with large hanging branches on the open top bus. I know it's not directly the tour company's fault but just be really careful and watch out for the branches. One in particular went straight down the centre of the seats if it would have been a foot either way someone would have been hurt. After about 30mins we arrived at sort of a central hub. At no point were we given any instructions. As our bus had the correct line on it we assumed we were picking up other passengers for this route. However after about another 20mins a member of staff shout to us ""get off the bus"" by this time all the other buses had filled with other passengers. This was getting very frustrating without even seeing anything. When eventually the other bus set off we plugged in the headphones, the commentators were extremely boring, monotone and repeated the same information as we went around a round about. We arrived at stop 4 which looked like it had nice views so we decided to get off. We have a 5 and a 7 year old so my wife made her way Infront of me off the bus as we got to the bottom of the stairs the driver started to set off. I asked him to wait as I was coming down the stairs with my 5 year old, he began to shout and wave his arms, by this time I was angry and fed up of the tour, I shouted back and told him to calm down. When I got off I refused to get back on again, it was the biggest waste of £65 I've ever known. We walked all the way back to the port which gave a much more better impression of Lisbon. I've been on a few open top tours in New York, London etc and this was by far the worst I've been on. Do yourself a favour and walk..",1
Bad service,"Bad service, the buses take more than 1 hour to return to the points, with me 3 buses passed directly from the points leaving customers planted in the street waiting for a next... Cityrama Lisbon never again! I don't recommend to anyone... just awful",1
Terrible!,"Horrible. Bus overcrowded no seats, bus broke down would not refund ticket ! Do not bother. Waste of money.
Negative experience.",1
Do the research before you buy!,"It’s not that the tour was bad, it’s that it was poorly communicated to tourists. The tour included Coimbra, home to the oldest university in Portugal and Fatima which is a religious city. Coimbra also happens to be the fourth largest city in Portugal and the old capita yet we only stopped there for less than 30 minutes. It was literally a toilet stop and that is an absolute shame as I’m sure this city has a lot more to offer. The bulk of time was spent on the moving bus but we definitely stayed longer at Fatima. That’s great if you’re into visiting religious sites but not so great if your goal is to visit cultural sites like Coimbra. The tour guide and the driver were excellent and very professional but I would advise to do some research well before purchasing this tour.",2
Terrible end to the tour,"Was going to recommend but the end of the tour was so terrible, I give it a one. The driver stopped for literally two seconds at the major stop to get off and go to the Ribeira. There are no stop buttons on the top deck to request a stop, so you’d think they give people at least 20 seconds to get down the stairs. About 20 of us (from different groups) wanted to get off and had to ride all the way to stop one because he also skipped stop 13 entirely. Had to take an 8€ taxi to get back down to the river because he drove us all the way up to the top of the town again to batalha square. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1
LISBON,"We were very disappointed , half the plug in head phones were not working we had to all move chairs. The tour information was not very exciting .",1
NEVER USE THESE PEOPLE EVER EVER NOTHING BUT A RIP OFF,"We booked on this tour after departing our ship. Was sold it for a family of 5 for approx €124 told where we would be taken and the sights we would see. All we actually saw were office blocks and lots and lots of traffic. We had to virtually sit on the floor because we got crammed on the bus. The earphones even though they were new did not work or it was just the sound system. Would not let us off. Driver did not understand English. And considering it’s a tourist area you would think there would be some sort off communication.

We tried to complain at the office where the terminal was and asked to fill out a form but have never heard back of them to this day. Had I read the reviews I would not have gone on such a poor poor expensive nominal bus journey. If I wanted to sit on the floor viewing traffic and more traffic I would do that at home for a fraction of the cost. So PLEASE BE AWARE BEFORE YOU HOP ON WITH THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY.",1
Not quite good enough,"First, I buy a ticket online and then have to go all the way through the city to exchange my receipt for a QR code.
Are we in the 21st century?

30% of the route went on other roads than advertised.

Only about half of the first floor of the bus is covered.",2
Disaster,"Completely outdated, sound barely understandable, content of the text weak!!!, mostly just music, completely boring, fingers off, really not worth it; no service, just weak!!! Better explore the city differently; the worst hop on off tour ever!!!",1
BAD Ticketing policy by Company disappoints !!!!,"I had high hopes for this tour as I have done GrayLine HOHF in The US. Reserving and paying was easy. I expected an Email with tickets that would be down loaded and stored on my mobile. I was WRONG. I had to down load an app which gave me my reservation code, I presented it at the ticket office where they printed a flimsy paper receipt with a QR code.

We boarded a small bus easily but the roof wasn't retracted even in absence of rain, this restricted vision. The app easily allowed you to highlight the tour, however there was no notice prior to booking the tour that the route to Belem had 80% of the stops cancelled because of road closures on Sunday Due to the Lisbon Marathon. We did a shorter route first and planned the longer route to Belem in the afternoon even with the stop closures. Unfortunately I lost the flimsy paper ticket ( it was like a cheap corner store receipt). The attendant at the ticket office said Company policy was not to issue a replacement. I would have been more careful was I aware of this.
When I asked why, she pointed to the notice on the wall behind her regarding the policy with a curt apology and no further explanation. I know she was just doing her job the policy wasn't hers

This ticket issue should have been resolved easily with today's computer tech/apps where an electronic ticket is emailed to the purchaser thus lost tickets would not be an issue.

I'm very disappointed with this company. Take a bus tour with another company NOT Grayline.",1
Not worth the money,Very difficult to find stops .. no advance map or info… headphones didn’t work in 5 of the 6 seats we were in. The one headphone that did work wouldn’t switch to English. Real waste of money.,1
Total waste of time and money,"Absolute waste of time and money, don't bother. We were in Lisbon for a day as part of a cruise, there is a desk in the terminal as you get off the ship, I only wanted the red route but was sold both blue and red routes as not much extra which I appreciate is my fault, but I thought if we get round the city quickly we can also use the blue route.
Spent 20 mins on the bus before departing, then headed through gridlock traffic to the start point, the entire journey took nearly 3 hours, the commentary was rubbish, we spent most of the journey crawling in traffic. It would have been much better off getting the local bus up to the monastery, Belem de nata and Belem tower and back again, as it was we only saw these on the drive by on the bus as if we'd of got off I was concerned about missing seeing places of interest around the main city centre. Which we did manage to do on foot in the afternoon we also had a quick ride on the 28 tram which is only a few euros. In future I will stick to public transport for getting around cities, google maps is great at showing suitable buses to get you from A to B and a fraction on the cost of the Hop on Hop off bus.
Unless you can't walk far don't bother.
Like previous people have mentioned there is no announcement of which stop you are at unless you can see from your seat it's a guess.
Needless to say all the people on our bus were complaining how rubbish it was.",1
Very slow and freshly thawed meat,"Value for money, pathetic, thawed meat and very dry, after waiting 2 hours to eat. I don't recommend eating.",1
Lisbon Grey Linr,Numerous plugging points didn't work. My wife had no commentry at all. What commentry I got when poor. Also english is 6 not 4,1
Never again,"Worst hop on hop off tour ever. Bus completely outdated, sound on headphones only with noise, eternal waiting times once you have gotten off and the highlight on the blue lines: the 3 main stops (vasco de gamma) without previous not approached. Niiiiieeee wieder",1
Total Timo,"Very bad service, stops are not marked, you can spend more than an hour waiting at the stop, and in the end leave without the bus coming
The outdated explanations
In short the worst tourist bus service we have had on our trips
Tip Don't hire him if you don't want to feel ripped off",1
Not worth it.,"This gets you from A to B, that’s it. Routes seem complicated with much wasted time, maybe it’s the one way streets but… The commentary is pathetic, 2 lines per stop. What would it take to vamp it up? No historical background. Just states what it is you’re seeing, not always well synchronized. Your drop off is not necessarily at the attraction, just sort of close. I have done this in many cities, and usually they are great, In my opinion, a waste of money in Lisbon.",2
Waste of time,Do not book this!!! Their earphones do not work and they do not care!!! Unless you want to go on a tour and learn nothing. Their customer service is rude and non existent.,1
Dont do Grayline for Lisbon city.,Poorly organised. Poor information. No service. No acceptance of responsibilty to customers. My headphone plug in didnt work. Bus stops poorly marked.The English commentary was condescending. Go with the other red bus group..more buses regularly.,1
Incomprehensible,"We saw the green line bus arrive earlier at the stop and then we were more than 1h waiting and none appeared... We gave up.
But you can see there was an unforeseen, we give the benefit of the doubt.

With the red line and Boat everything ok, except the audio that didn't work well.

With the paid ticket, with the QR code on the mobile phone, I was forced to go hand over the paper tickets to our friends who bought the tickets together with me, did not let them make the tour...
You don't understand why they're issuing a digital QR code and we can only use it on paper...

The tours are nice, but the experience with the tickets ruined everything.",2
Try another company,"I’ve used this company in lots of cities before and this was by far the worst audio guide!
It’s basically just music playing - very little information or interesting facts given. If you were on the bus there was no announcement or information given as to which stop you were at…it was a complete guessing game.",2
bad tour badly organized,"The trip started in the worst way, we waited at the agreed time in the agreed place for pick up, but no one showed up. After calling for half an hour both the Company and our Hotel that had made our Reservation, we learned that the pick up point was somewhere else and luckily they managed to take us there. after that we waited for another hour that they defined the various groups with different destinations and let us get on the bus. they counted us and recounted several times, and we left. during the trip they explained that er logistical issues we would have to change buses, with a smaller one (actually we had to change it 2 times, and the 2nd was really small and we were compressed like sardines). Also the Guide during one of the stops lost 2 people that we had to wait.
Guide Recommendation to do less nice with guests and more professional.",1
Don't go!,"Crowded bis with poor air conditioning. Our bilingual guide was limited in what she knew, and mumbled when speaking, so we couldn't tell the Spanish from the English. The lunch was mediocre, we could have done better picking our own restaurant. Sintra castle was crowded, I felt like a hamster being herded through a maze. To be dropped at our hotel after the tour, we spent an additional hour on the bus. Overall, the worst touristic experience in 60 years of travel.",1
Not worth it,"Buses were way too far apart. Waited 35 minutes on the Red line whilst the competitors came and went every 10 minutes. Once on, the bus stopped at the next stop to inform us the audio was broken and we needed to change buses. This then took another 15 minutes & the audio on the next bus didn’t work either. I’d recommend you choose a different company that has frequent bus pickups & drop offs & working audio equipment.",1
Completely unhelpful,"We bought tickets for all the family for the red line in Lisbon, we stopped at the second stop of the track meaning to get the bus at the same spot. We reached the stop, and found the bus there, we asked the staff if we could get in but we were told to wait ten minutes and then we could have. While waiting, another bus of the same company passed through, honking but didn’t stop and continued its way to other stops. So we asked again the staff when the bus would be leaving and the answer was: this bus is only meant to sell tickets you have to wait for another one and wasn’t able to inform us on the time of the arrival of the next bus, mind you they didn’t even notice the first bus stopping buy and honking. We had to wait for more than half an hour in total and wasted lots of time, all under august heat. The only solution they were able to provide us was to walk all the way back to the starting point of the tour and ask for a refund.",1
Very Bad Tour,"Do NOT take this tour!! We did the Red (Belem/Lisboa) tour. We have done many hop on hop off tours in other cities and enjoyed them…this was awful, a complete waste of time! With the rich history of both Lisbon and Portugal, there is plenty to talk about. There was really no significant information about the history of the city or Portugal. However the audio consisted largely of bad elevator music as we drove by apartment houses. When we did go by an actual point of interest almost no information was given other than the name of the POI and perhaps the year it was built. As an example, we came past a point on the river where it was stated many of the famous Portuguese explorers departed from….wow, very interesting tell me more…which ones? Maybe some information about some of those explorers? Maybe an interesting anecdote from their adventures….NO! Nothing more!

The only thing worse than one of these Lisbon tours is 2! (ie do not get the 2 tour “deal” !!)",1
Woeful,"Woeful no commentary, no explanation as to why no commentary spent 90 minutes not knowing anything about the region we were driving thru
Told the driver we had no idea what stop to get off and he muttered in Portuguese and threw his hands in the air
We went back to the office where we bought the tickets to be told we should have told the driver to flick the switch!
Surely that’s his job once he turns on the ignition
Don’t waste your precious time or money go to the competitor you won’t be disappointed
We paid a lot for what we could have done on a local bus",1
If you want to learn about Lisbon this is a complete waste of money .,"Terrible tour . No information about the stops or what you could see at them. No commentary as we passed statues and palaces etc. Next to no commentary at all , just lots of music playing in the earphones and the only comments there were could have be been written by an 8 yr old . ‘ museums are a great way to learn new things’ - what museum ??? would not recommend. Learnt nothing about Lisbon. Really disappointed.",1
Cityrama Gray Line Hop-on Hop-off -AVOID LIKE the PLAGUE,"If you want to meet the most unsmiling, unfriendly people in Portugal and need to call an Uber because the buses don’t run as advertised and you are stranded, then this is the tour for you!

We thought the hop-on, hop-off bus tour would be a great way to get an overview of Lisbon and see Cascais. The recorded audio tour sounds like it is being done by Robin Leach, is somewhat repetitive and not particularly full of information, but it is adequate. The buses are supposed to run by each stop approximately every 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the two times we “hopped off” the buses on two different days, the bus never returned after an extended wait. We needed to call an Uber both times in order to get home.

This was a TERRIBLE experience and would avoid this tour.",1
Terrible customer service.,Bus was 20 minutes late. Poor signage on bus caused me and a few others to get on wrong bus. Audio guide was non functional so I wasted 2 hours driving around a city and not know what I was looking at. Asked for refund but was offered $3.00 off of the $30.00 ticket. Oh ...and the bus driver drove like a maniac through the entire tour. Even speeding 10 KM over speed limit in school zone- there was a RADAR speed sign. I do NOT recommend.,1
A Lisbon bus tour with not nice surprises,"We arrived in Lisbon by cruise ship. In the terminal at the exit were various providers for tours. The first Red Line offered a tour for 27€ per person. We assumed that the bus departed from various sights and did not want to get off. This tour should take two hours on request. It started a drive through the city, traffic jam, traffic lights, stops, it was bad.
After two hours, the bus stopped somewhere and we were told to get off, the journey had ended here. We told the employee we were going to the ship. We'd have to take the next bus to the ship.
Which was also true....after another two hours we arrived at our ship.
Good thing we drove early, otherwise we might have missed it.",2
Very disappointing tour,"I was very disappointed in the hop-on-hop-off tour by Gray Line I took yesterday for several reasons. Initially we were directed to the nearest stop to begin the tour which was approximately a half-length from the sales office. Porto is hilly so this treck was not an easy one. But what infuriated me was that we drove back and stopped at the sales office. Why the treck then?
Secondly, I found it impossible to determine which site the recorded narrative was describing as we drove past. This needs to be clearer.
And finally, our route map was not the route we took. There were only 3 downtown stops which did not facilitate our sightseeing. Frustrating!
I'll not book another Gray Line tour as my vacation time is valuable & they wasted my morning. Avoid them!",2
Wasted time - many problems.,"Internet booking led to problems due to a system change. Two stops were not served. Information about this was only available in the app - 20 people waited for over an hour in vain for the bus.
In summary, and after the problems were solved, there was hardly any time left for sightseeing.
In the buses, the audio devices in the open area were barely legible. The traditional continuous music in the audio guide was too loud.
You do have a 24-hour ticket - but the buses only run until around 6:30 p.m.
An email to one of the addresses provided was not answered.",1
Dreadful waste of money.,"Originally we had tickets for the Yellowbus line through our Travel Agent, but arrived in Porto to find they were no longer in business, despite all the bus stop signs still up. So bought another ticket for 48 hrs on the red bus which included the blue line across the river.
Audio commentary was scant - more music than commentary and often after we passed to POI. Buses infrequent and no communication from any of the drivers. Nobody told us that stops were closed and we had planned our visits around some of these spots near the port tasting areas. Would have cried if we hadn’t laughed as we sailed past our stops at a million miles and hour and ended up back at our starting point! Driver obviously wanted to get home!!
I do not recommend this company. It’s quicker and more efficient to walk and get your cardio fitness up!!",2
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS OR TRIPADVISOR AT ALL,"DO NOT BUY TRIPS FROM THIS SELLER OR TRIP ADVISOR.
i purchased this trip and it reads 2:30 for a meeting point.
i arrived at the designated place 2:20 and was told that the person left.....
15 minutes prior the time showed on the purchase, when escalated to trip advisor they say all party were agree to NOT REFUND THE MONEY.

its just an scam.... BE CAREFULL",1
Disappointment of my visit,"My disappointment regarding the guided tour that I recently followed in Porto at the end of May 2024. I understand that works may require changes to the route, but at no time was it made known to us that the route would be modified and that we would not be able to not seeing most of the interesting monuments that we expected.
Despite these changes, the price of the tour remained the same, which seems unfair to me given the reduced value of the experience.
I strongly recommend that you inform future participants of any route changes in advance and adjust prices accordingly. This would help manage expectations better and ensure higher customer satisfaction.",2
Bad audio content,"The audio guide is bas. It is very limited and unspecific. For example, it gives a small bit of info on a building but does not describe it nor say where to look for it.",2
Use a different operator. Dreadful day!,"We bought a 1 day pass as we have limited time and have used this company in many cities before.

However, this was awful. No room on the bus, despite another almost empty bus not stopping at our stop. Very few of the jack points worked so we couldn't get the commentary. The bus was very old and partially broken ... and the driver was appalling ... driving dangerously fast and using his brakes very aggressively.
What a waste of 54 euro and our time. Use a different operator.",1
Unhelpful Grayline Staff...Use Another Company,"Rude and Unhelpful Grayline Staff. Try a different Company!
For a company dealing in tourism there was not one encounter that was good. Whoever we asked a question to the answer was the same... scan the QR code and you will get answers. It was clear that couldn't be bothered. Standing around doing NOTHING!",1
GRAY LINE HOP ON HOP OFF LISBON BUS - DO NOT USE GRAY LINE!,"Our ship docked at around midday on 16 May and a lot of passengers bought tickets in the port terminal building for the Hop On Hop Off city tour, for a circular journey said to be 1.5-2hrs depending upon traffic. We were assured the bus we got on at around 12.30 was red line. Most of the headphones didn't work and those that did the volume was so low it was difficult to hear...we sat downstairs as I walk with a stick. An upstairs passenger came down to ask that the volume be increased and explained many had issues with headphones, requesting faulty bus be reported. Driver unable to change volume and said the company knew about the faults. We couldn't work out where we were headed, as route didn't seem to follow map given. Gave up on map and headset as narrative when I was able to hear it didn't seem to match where we were. After an HOUR touring the slums of Lisbon, dilapidated buildings covered in graffiti and any number of sad, homeless people in tents and doorways, we appeared to arrive at Stop Number 1! A further HOUR AND A BIT brought us to the river again but a long way from the ship and the red route seemed to go inland again, back to Stop Number 1. Many disgruntled passengers asked how we were to get back to the ship and were told to get off and walk if we were unhappy. At the next stop most of us got off and shared taxis back to the ship. Needless to say, the ticket office in the port was empty...having taken our money they weren't going to stay around to face the music. We were able to see that there are two different companies operating Hop On Hop Off tours. MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE - DO NOT USE GRAY LINE.",1
"Don’t bother, not worth it. Do something else.",How could you make Lisbon boring!!! Audio really dull and not synchronised with tour.Oriente route not worth seeing. A wasted 2 hours,2
Don’t Red Bus in Lisbon,The worst Red bus city tour I have been on. These are usually excellent. The commentary was poor and not in alignment with the bus. The music in between the comments got on the nerves. The bus stopped at two of the stops for at least 15 minutes. The stops were not announced by number let alone at all. No wonder we got 2 days for the price of 1 ! Don’t let it stop you using the Red bus in other cities,2
Do not even think about it,"The headphones don't even work, the drivers have no courtesy, they give a bad perception of the country. Supervision is urgent. At the main stop, lines are not respected",1
Bad line,"Long waiting times at stops.
These were not continuous or complete. Audio guide sometimes doesn't work.
It's better to take the red line. Things are probably better there.",1
Total waste of money.,"This was the worst hop on hop off bus tours I’ve ever experienced. There were a number of seats that you couldn’t plug in the audio ear piece. The seats where the commentary was working it was hopeless with a lot of music, couldn’t turn the volume up, not much information on the buildings or the area. Traffic was very heavy, the bus crawled along, we had no idea where we were. Total waste of money for 4 hours..",1
Unhappy for two 85 year old's,"It was very, very difficult to find the Get on/Get off stops.
My ticket included visit to Wine Cellar, impossible to find a person that knows where we should go to meet bus.
The bus trip was very poor compared to the Red bus, your driver was not able to answer our questions in English????

Will not recommend Gray line",2
Disappointing,"Very disappointed with our visit. (Especially visiting the Burmester cellars) We visited Lisbon and loved it. It was monotonous, the information was very sporadic and more or less interesting. Ok if you like to take a bus ride around the city...For the Burmester cellars, it's a tourist trap, 10-15 minutes max of boring explanations and then straight to the tasting, no visit to the cellars! We didn't even use the 2nd day included",2
"Full of promise, reality disappointing.","We bought a 2 line ticket, red and green lines over 48 hours. On the red line on the first day the driver missed 3 stops which meant that we had a 25 minute walk to get back to where we wanted to be. The next day on the green line we waited at stop 3 for 50 minutes for a bus to continue our journey then when a bus did turn up there was no room. The driver estimated that another would be along in 15 minutes but no guarantee that this would also be full. We were very disappointed.",1
Long wait,"We waited at the Castle stop for more than 30 minutes. Two buses arrived at once.
Enjoyment is below average. The regular bus runs much more often.",2
Avoid,We suggest to avoid. It’s (the hop on hop off model)worked well for us in other world-cities but the traffic is too heavy in Lisbon to allow the buses to be any way on time. We had to wait in full sun heat for well over half an hour for one (having narrowly missed one due to a very unhelpful staff member at the stop). The narration on tape is dreadful (long bouts of boring music interspersed with repetitive drivel about some of the sights - I don’t want to hear about the Hard Rock Cafe three times thanks). Many of the staff at stop #1 were varying unhelpful to down right rude. We eventually just got off and walked around.,2
Terrible service never again,"Reviews should be constructive, we used the Green and Red line bus. THEREFORE.
Improve the audio, the sound was limited to just about hearable, the content was insufficient , eg. advising we were at bus stop 13 after the bus had stopped, how about telling me before it arrives at the stop. No information on a potential sight till we had passed.
No relevant information in any leaflet about what could be seen at places listed at the stops.

Would we visit Lisbon again, Yes
Would we use you bus again, NEVER",1
Not a good service,"Not worth the price we paid. Buses don’t run regular enough, the app does not correspond with the bus stops. Very confusing where to get the bus. Waited half an hour for a bus at stop 13 on purple line only to see it diverted away from us. No mention anywhere it wasn’t stopping at this stop! 4 adults, 2 young children, had to get an Uber back to hotel. Travelled to Oceanario through residential areas of Lisbon. No headphones or commentary, maybe because nothing to comment on!! Again long wait for bus to go back into town. Over 120 euros for 2 days, definitely not worth the money. Buses need to run more regularly. Never again!",1
Not Enjoyable,"Over crowded, had to stand almost the entire way and when we were finally seated only 1 of 5 of us had audio that worked properly. Surely you can do better.
A tightly packed €23 bus ride with no audio just isn’t worth it.",2
Never again!,"Waiting time of more than an hour in the blazing sun, an extremely unfriendly driver, but 4!!! empty buses at the last stop.",1
Too much waiting,"Few buses, timetable not respected, long waiting times. The application changes schedule every ten minutes.
Take the yellow! More frequencies",1
Deplorable company!,"A company to avoid because the plans are not correct, the schedules are inaccurate and are not respected
For example, we have been waiting for an hour for the bus, normally with a frequency of 8 p.m. to 30 minutes, and it is still not here!
And the competing company has more interesting circuits
Jyves",1
Experience not recommended,"48h Pass Lisbon, the welcome on the first day was not very friendly. The young woman was unpleasant. The stops are poorly indicated and in the event of a stop crowded by a tourist bus, the driver does not look to see if people want to get on. Passages on the blue line are random. The guides for Belem district excursions, Sintra Cascais very good.",2
Too much waiting time and rude staff,"This company are literally a waste of money and of your precious TIME!!

This Good Friday morning I bought the tickets for the family and quickly I regreted. When the first bus arrived (after waiting 30mins) was full and not enough space for us.
The sales lady in Restauradores Square told me to wait for the next one. We wait for more 40mins and no signal of the bus. Then, I went towards the sales lady (at that time was 2 girls of them there) to ask for the refund. They say no to me quest and they were very rude dealing with all the situation.
I think this is not a good way to deal with your clients but maybe because it's a big company, maybe it's the operating policy..

During the time waiting for the bus I observe that more people were in the same situation than my family, with tickets and waiting for the bus to pick them on the stop.
Hop on hop off is good on the theory because realistically, they don't make your vacations be fluid.

I recommend you to avoid buying Grayline hop on hop off tickets and look for better tours options..",1
Literal waste of time,"This was a literal waste of time. Waited long to get on the bus which seemed to have no real schedule. The app didn’t work so you’re really left to wait and wonder where exactly each stop was (no real signage) and when to expect the bus. When we were finally on the bus, the tour recording was lacking and often announced the stop and attractions at that stop as the bus was pulling off! Too late at that point to get off. We wanted to get off at times but worried about how long we would be stuck at a particular stop so we just stayed on. We finally decided to just walk and take public transport to get around. Much better use of our time.",2
Yellow Bus is Much Better,"Don't waste your time. We bought tickets then were refused entry to the bus, he gave us the wrong tickets and said we could buy more line but the bus had left already. Poor service and even if you have the right ticket it does not always scan correctly.",1
Bad experience,"Picked up a tour bus and paid for a ticket at the cruise terminal in Lisbon. Was not put off by road works.

Informed by the lady that the bus is every 30 minutes was not the case.

Ear plug inn's not working on a loop. Lady bus driver tried to reset and fix problem. Tour got on. Then we pulled in to transfer on to another packed tour bus. Informed issue with bus ok.

People who could not fit on stayed on the bus that we got off? Which followed behind us.

Got off at bus hub to be informed to get on another line to go back to the cruise terminal that we have to wait one and a half hours? Not 30 minutes as Informed.

Then, I got back on the same bus on the gray line bus stop 5 to walk back to the cruise terminal. NOT A NICE EXPERIENCE. Put me off.",2
Very bad experience,"On Sunday, only one bus ran on the blue line all day. The information is sparse or only one sentence for some sights. In the evening, the bus ended at point 1 at 6 p.m.",1
Disappoint experience with Hop-on Hop-off Tour in Lisbon,"My partner and I were excited to explore Lisbon with a Hop-On Hop-Off tour, expecting a seamless experience to discover the city's highlights. Unfortunately, our experience fell short of our expectations.

Firstly, the ticketing process was needlessly cumbersome. Despite downloading our tickets, we were required to visit a kiosk to have them printed, without any forewarning about the consequences of losing them. It was frustrating to discover that the QR code on the app wasn't utilized for boarding, leading to unnecessary complications when we misplaced our printed tickets.

Furthermore, the tour's equipment left much to be desired. The headphones provided were non-functional on both the first and second buses we boarded, depriving us of the audio commentary vital for understanding the sites we were passing. This equipment failure significantly detracted from the tour experience.

Additionally, we were disappointed by the attitude of the drivers, who displayed rudeness throughout the journey. This was not an isolated incident, as fellow passengers also voiced their dissatisfaction with the drivers' demeanor.

In summary, our Hop-On Hop-Off tour was marred by logistical inefficiencies, equipment malfunctions, and poor customer service. We hope that the company addresses these issues to provide future customers with a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience.",2
too much money for a bad service,"Waste of money. If you buy an online ticket you can not use the digital ticket you get. It should be changed to a paper one (printed on thermo paper). After two days the QR code was not readable anymore and they could not give me a new tickets.

The public transport is great in Lissabon. For 6,80 per day you travel (including tram 28) to everywhere!",1
Rudeness from Cascais Line driver,"One star, but considering ZERO STARS for the driver Antônio da Linha de Cascais, he was extremely rude and rude. When greeting him, I asked him a question: *Good morning, - sir, to get to Boca do Inferno, do I get off at point 9 or 10? and what time will you return? .... Simply, he responded in a loud tone of voice rudely and pointing his finger in my face he said: - to begin with I'm not young, call me driver or Antônio which is my name, then he put the earphone in my hand where I was holding the pamphlet about this company's lines and he told me to put the phone in the spot on the bus seat that explained where I should get off... I was perplexed by this reaction, but in a tone of In a low voice I said that when I called him *young man it was out of pure politeness, out of respect for him, I didn't know his name, at that moment he spoke to me in a very loud tone of voice - What if I called you ma'am* The girl, girl, girl (he repeated the word three times)... I was shocked by such an unnecessary and aggressive attitude and I said that I would respect him if he called me girl because I understand that it is a word that comes from the culture of his country, At that moment I simply left this sad person with the pitiful expression of voice and gestures and went to the bus seat. I noticed in this individual a great dissatisfaction with the work he does, without empathy and sympathy for customers, tourists.",1
"Not worth the cost, hire a local taxi","The staff were disinterested and like other reviewers mention, the commentary does not link with the ride and there is no information beofre the stop to tell you what to see and encourage you to get off. The timings are erratic, we waited 45 minutes at one stop, gave up and took a cab to the next stop, then waited there, with a lot of other people who had been there for ages, and still no bus. So 44 euros for one half hour trip as we abandoned.",1
Be careful,"We took 3 of the trips over 4 days and can honestly say that the Red Line is the only one that covered most of what we were hoping to see.
The ladies in the ticket office were multilingual and helpful. However the drivers were unfriendly, unhelpful and one was downright rude! He drove through 3 red traffic lights whilst playing games on his mobile phone! Ourselves and a number of other passengers got off without completing the tour, purely because we felt unsafe. We then took further trips by train.",1
Miserable and unhelpful driver,"Today on the blue line leaving at stop 1 at 11.45, sitting up top at the front, the windscreen wipers were off and it's raining heavily so we can hardly see out. Another passenger asks the driver to put the wipers on and they came on for 3 seconds then stayed off again. Spoiled our trip not seeing out properly. Another passenger tells the driver there's a leak in the front upstairs, the driver makes a face and says that's normal. We needed a more friendly and helpful driver, he wasn't one of them.",1
Cascais Tour,"Terrible! The driver didn't know how to give information and was extremely rude!
The company also refused to provide help!",2
Never take GreyLine!,The bus departed late from the beginning. I was told the wrong line. Waited for an hour and forty-five minutes for the next one. The sellers on the street were rude. The Wi-Fi on one bus did not work. I reported all the issues and nothing was done.,1
Don’t waste your time,"I purchased my ticket online, so did not receive any direction. I couldn’t find a bus stop for hours on my first day. Website is glitchy. The live schedule doesn’t work. One day I couldn’t see my location, the next day I couldn’t see the buses. No bus timetable online. I called them several times for information and was always given incorrect information. Purchase tickets for the red hop on hop off bus. Ive waited 50 minutes for a bus because I was given incorrect information and I saw no less that 12 red buses go by. Dont waste your time and ruin your trip by booking the yellow bus.",1
Take the other one,"Terrible, a shame, buses always late, hours of waiting, equipment to follow the tours not working, unprofessional guides, the other company is much better. DON'T BE FOOLED, they are always red buses.",1
Pick another hop on hop off linr,Sitting at stop 13 in Lisbon—Red line—where bus driver would not open the door even though we had tickets. So now we wait for the next one and hope the driver is not near so rude and unaccommodating. It was a total disregard for the customer and by far our most callous experience in all of Europe that we visited. Guess he needed to get the route done and get to a bar or something. It has soured me on this service and any future hop on hop off will be with another line and I will avoid and search NOT to ride with a Grayline bus hoping a competitor is available.,1
Do not book this tour! Maria Theresa is a terrible guide! You will not see what you paid to see!,"We booked this tour, and were very excited to see the largest waves and the best surfers in the world at Sitio in Nazare. Our tour description states "" ...enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding scenery from the village's highest point, Sitio.""

Our guide was Maria Theresa.

However, Maria Theresa dropped us off at a tourist trap little beach in Nazare with waves as high as an ice skating rink, and no surfers at all. There, I looked through my monocular and could see huge waves and surfers at Sitio about two miles away almost hidden behind a cliff. When I went back to the bus and asked Maria Theresa if we were going to see the surfers at Sitio, she responded that there were no waves or surfers today due to the weather. I offered her my monocular to see Sitio and the surfers about two miles away at which point she got very mad, and refused to look. If you don't have a monocular and didn't know what you were looking for, you might indeed believe that there were no waves due to the weather based on what our guide told us.

I asked Maria Theresa if we were going to Sitio, and she got even more mad, and said that if we wanted to see Sitio, then we should have hired a private driver; we were not going to Sitio, period. I showed her the written tour description stating we were going to the ""highest point, Sitio,"" and she became furious. She stated that Nazare is a fishing village, there was no surfing today due to the weather, and that she knows this because she is from Portugal, and I am not. She then refused to answer any more of my questions, and began very loudly talking to the bus driver in Portuguese. I asked her to speak English so I could understand her, and she refused.

This tour was a rip off, our guide was arrogant, rude, untruthful, and the written tour description if false. There were many other issues with the tour as well, but really too much to write about.

Lesson leaned; do not tour with Cityrama Gray Line, and especially with tour guide Maria Theresa.",1
"A true disaster, what is offered does not correspond to reality. waste of time and money","It is a disaster and completely inadvisable.
They give you a map with the different stops that the two lines have, the blue and the orange. And it turns out that they do not coincide at all with reality, but no one informs you (neither at the sales stands nor the driver), so if you plan to get off to take the other line, you may find that it does not go there. But not every line complies with the route of the plane.
If there are works and the stops change, they must update the plans, or make provisional plans, or at least notify them.
A disaster that only wastes your time and money",1
Absolute Waste of Time and Money,Joined the bus at the cruise port . On entering the bus the driver never asked to see the tickets and made no effort to communicate. Went upstairs only to find that you needed to have collected your individual ear pieces from the driver . Returned down stairs and helped myself from a box on the windscreen. The fun then started getting the audio system to work . When it eventually started it was nay on next to useless. Crackling noises and over loud Fauda music and little or know information. Tried following the route designated on the map and coordinating it with the reference points . I’m not sure the bus even followed the designated route. Spent the first hour in crawling traffic in what can only be described as urban sprawl and no indication as to what was relevant in the area apart from Cortes Ingles department store ! I won’t bore you with any more information as the tour was a complete rip off and a waste of time . Been on many city tours of this type all over the world and this one was the absolute pits . At the first opportunity got of the bus near to the entrance to the city and enjoyed a afternoon on foot. Don’t waste 27 euros on the tour get a Tuk Tuk or a taxi instead .,1
Awful,It was awful Recording rarely mentioned any of the high lights Sort a driver do you had to wait forever for next bus I would never use again,1
Very poor customer service!!!!,"Very rude and disrespectful ticket agent. Afterward threw her hand up smiling when she saw me taking her picture. Very insulting. Notified bus driver that the portal for the earphone was inoperable. There were no more seats. She said oh well sorry. Thus, I had no tour information for which I paid. Use one of the competitors stay away from this company.",1
Avoid in winter,"Whilst we had no problems with the bus when we were on them, the major issue is that in winter the times between bus gets very long (45 minutes for red line and 60 minutes for blue line). This wouldn't be an issue if there was any live bus tracking feature, but there isn't (Android and iOS apps mentioned in the booklet don't seem supported on any modern device).

This means that we avoided getting off the bus as we would not be sure when we could get back on it. So definitely avoid in winter, especially if you have young children (use the metro instead).",2
Sitting on the stairs instead of a seat.,"Half way round the tour we got off on the understanding that the next bus would be along in half an hour. It wasn't. We stood for a full hour and when the bus came it was full. I had to sit on the stairs, totally unable to see anything and with nowhere to plug in the commentary phones.
Complaining was a total waste and even writing to complain evoked a ""Sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused""!!
A waste of the afternoon. Travel with someone else.",1
"Buyer be aware, broken technology and map is not clear or helpful",We bought tickets for the Gray Line Cityrama Portugal Red line and Blue line hop on hop off bus tours. We tried to download the app so we could see the stops but the app is broken. The map provided is not clear. We immediately requested a refund at the ticket office where we purchased the tickets but no refunds are provided.,2
The worst city tour ever !!!,This was a very disappointing experience from the beginning. The earphones would not connect into the plugs and staff was unable to help. The bus was packed (we came from a cruise ship and another one was docked right next to us) so we could not change seats. We changed buses to get on another route and none of the staff was able to tell us when next bus would come. Finally it came and the tour on the new route was short lived as the bus broke down and we had to wait for another bus. Again no help from staff. When we reached out to customer service afterwards in writing we were brushed off. It’s mind boggling that an international company like gray line operates like that in Lisbon. We should have listened to the independent destination adviser on our cruise ship and have gone with the yellow buses ( who did not have a booth in the cruise terminal). I learned my lesson : NEVER ever Gray Line.,1
"Cityrama, NO WAY.","On 11/14 at the Marquês de Pombal stop (Lisbon) I booked a tour package covering 2 lines for 48 hours for €26. Tickets for three adults. (78€). When hiring, the company representative informed me that it would be a Red Line plus Blue, Green or Yellow. She never asked me to define the 2nd line that I intended to use. Because of her, she defined the Green line on the ticket. I repeat, she did not ask us to define the 2nd line. When we arrived the next day (15/11) at the same stop to take the Blue line, which was our desire, we were prevented from getting on the bus and if we wanted to go we would have to pay extra. The girl who sold the tickets before requesting it showed her dislike and stated that there was nothing she could do. We went to the company's kiosk already irritated by this situation that we did not create and the attendant stated that that was it, that there was nothing she could do, that we were rude and stated that she would call the police. If this is your company's policy, I would like to be informed because other Brazilians need to know these details.
I would like to add that the attendant did not even suggest returning the payment for the 2nd day that we would no longer use. In Brazil we would say: “You lost Mané” That was the feeling I had, the feeling of having been deceived.
We contacted the company but the person responsible is advised to respond with evasions.",1
No interest ! Services to avoid at all costs!!!,"Almost no comments in the audio guide! Nothing justifies paying 22
€!to tour the city's bus stops!",1
Avoid Graybar HOHO in Lisbon!,"We stopped in Lisbon on a cruise and decided to do a HOHO bud tour around Lisbon to get a feel for what we wanted to see. We bought tickets at the cruise terminal from Graybar and went to the bus. The upper level seats were dirty and the bud looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while. We were on the red line but when the bus left they took us on the blue line (much less desirable, mainly working class apt neighborhoods) for an hour and then they finally switched to the red line itinerary. The audio portion was so bad we couldn’t use it, it was garbled and full of distortion that you couldn’t understand a word! Even trying other plugs didn’t help. There were many complaints from other passengers but no one did anything! The bus didn’t stop at some of the stops and the first opportunity to actually hop off was almost an hour into the drive.

We have done several HOHO tours but this one was the worst. Save your money and book one of the other tour buses!",1
Don’t use this service,"I wish I had read reviews before we bought tickets. We bought the ticket and were given a map showing three routes of different colours. Once the journey started there was no announcement to say what route we were on and when announcements were made the English was so bad it was hard to tell when the speaker was speaking Portuguese and when he was speaking English. We were on a cruise and only had four or five hours in Lisbon but the first hour of this trip was spent driving to the outskirts of the city and back again where there was nothing worth seeing. When the bus stopped in a central place, there was nothing to help us decide whether it was a good place to get off and then we set off on another route without knowing which one it was. Eventually we ended up back in town, got off the bus and never got on again.
The bus didn’t explore any of the main part of Lisbon because it is not allowed to as they have small lanes and it is mostly pedestrianised.
We then discovered that the port was only five minutes walk from the edge of the centre. I have given it one star because it did take us along to the Magellan monument but we could have got a tram there for two euros. We wasted 25 euros and an hour of our precious time in Lisbon :(",1
Don't buy it!,"Just appalling, we boarded from the port, have been going for 2 hours and still waiting for the start! Dirty vehicles, audio broken, unscheduled stops for no reasons and hopeless staff who ignore your complaints. Don't be conned like us, save your money. Chaos",1
Lack of driver information,Why doesn't the driver know where the casino is? Is there a lack of training or is there another reason?,2
Very poor information about the bus route frequencies and where to get tockets.,"We chose the Lisbon hop on hop off tour, as they had four different routes and we thought this would give good coverage of Lisbon. We bought the tickets online and went to board a bus on a route which passed near our hotel. The driver told us that the ‘voucher’ bought online had to be exchanged at the place where all the routes start from. So we had to get a taxi there to get our actual tickets.

The brochures and web site advertising the routes and ticket prices don’t mention that tickets are only available at the central point.

Bus frequencies were poor. On some of the routes, if we were to have got off the bus, it would be more than an hour before another bus comes along. On some routes there appeared to be only one bus running. So, not really hop on hop off. More of a series of bus tours.

On some of the tours we went round, there were long queues of passengers at some of the stops and not all waiting passengers were able to board the buses that we were on.",2
Total waste of time,The 1/2 day Lisbon Grayline tour was part of the Air Canada Vacations Portugal North/South tour. It was a total waste of time. The guide was difficult to understand in English. She would not get off the bus to explain the historic site. There was no air on the bus and only after many tourists on the bus complained did the guide say “we have to check with the agency to see if we can turn on the air”…what a farce! We wish we would have booked the Sintra tour with a different tour company instead of wasting our time on this tour! Hope this is helpful! October 24 2023 morning tour!,1
Don’t waste your money!!!,Awful commentary with no history or significant details. Seemed like a bored afterthought. More than 3/4ths of the time we had to listen to awful music which was loud and painful. Very disappointing audio commentary. Take Uber’s instead and go exactly where you want with a good travel book for details!,1
Skip this in Lisbon,"I have been on hop on hop off buses in many cities around the world and thought they were fantastic. But the Lisbon cityrama bus is the absolute worst. I had to switch seats 5 times until I found an audio jack that actually worked. They do not provide very much historical, or interesting narrative. Many areas within the routes were not very attractive or interesting and a complete waste of time. Instead you are inundated with a loop of Portuguese elevator music piped through in poor quality audio. I used a Bose noise cancelling headset instead of the free orange ones provided so it should not have a constant hissing sound in the background.

I bought the ticket through the tourism office and was instructed that I needed to board the bus at stop # 1 instead of jumping on at any one of the stops close by. There isn’t an assistant selling or processing tickets on the bus. Or, to answer questions regarding historical sites or routes. Stop #1 was a huge hike from where I purchased the ticket. Being elderly with physical challenges this was quite an issue. I would advise, skipping the hop on hop hop bus in the city. Unfortunately, I purchased a 72 hour pass and it’s nonrefundable.",1
Unfriendly staff,"I inform the flight attendant Joana that my audio guide does not work and not only does she not pay any attention to me but she also answers me rudely.
The treatment with the staff has been terrible.
I think that to work in front of the public, people with a friendlier profile should be hired.",1
Terrible service,"Terrible service, infrequent, drivers without customer service, poorly labeled stops. Headphones don't work",1
"Hop-on, Hop-of tour bus","The city is small and it is much cheaper to use the train, subway and public buses. Cityrama employees, both ground staff (on the defensive) and drivers, super edge. There are no notices of the stops and the signs they have invite confusion. If you make a mistake they don't give you any option. At the Bethlehem tower, it was pouring rain, the driver made us get off the bus to look for the tickets. In Cascais he stopped in double row, was half a second and told us that we could no longer get off. We did it 1/2 hour later. To return to Lisbon we had to take the train and metro (much cheaper and with the certainty that you know where you are going) because they canceled a stop after having scheduled an Iron Man for months. At the stop there was no sign and as a consequence we either used the public transport service or we had a wait of 3 hours and a journey of one. In short, even if I was sick of wine, I would not contract services with this company again. A real scam, expensive and on top of that it seems like they are sparing your life.",1
Avoid at all cost,Absolutely shocking Really poor commentary. Started raining and even though we were undercover upstairs every section of the roof leaked with pouring rain coming through. Side windows also leaked. Avoid at all costs not worth the money at all,1
Avoid avoid avoid,Furious with this company. Bought ticket in the day for £85 for 4 people. Specifically chose this due to proximity to our hotel as we had one of our group with mobility issues and struggles to walk or stand for long. The office near Palace de Bolsa pointed us to a bus stop in easy walking distance. Waited an hour with about 50 other people to only find out that stop/route was closed. Was told to walk to another stop which was way to far for our disabled group member. Tried to get a refund as even the local office near the stop did not know that bus was not running that morning. So far they have refused. I will remove this review if they change their mind. Totally unacceptable business behaviour to treat people with disabilities with so much contempt. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. Use the Yellow bus instead.,1
Do Not Hop On These Whatever You Do,"We had one day to see Lisbon so bought a city hop on/off bus tickets for 26 euros each at 10am. Waited 50 minutes for 1st available bus. This ground through 1960s concrete suburbs for 30 minutes then kicked us off at a bus terminal for another 50 minutes. The next bus trawled us back down and up a boulevard which we had already come by. Stuck in central city traffic for another hour, no commentary, no sights, eventually going past our cruise ship again where we started from. Along the waterfront we went, no sights to see and stopped at the Belem Tower and told we were going straight back into the central gridlock of Lisbon so got off and paid 15 euros for a taxi back to the ship, just had time for a beer before ship sailed.
What an absolute disgrace. A complete waste of a day which cost 68 euros to see bugger all with unhelpful staff to boot.
Not a good tourist experience or advert for Lisbon as these look like an officially approved bus company.",1
Trashy company,"Trash company
Not many buses, so long waiting times
Not very clear where you can hop on.
Not worth your money! Waiting 45’ for a bus is way to long",1
Disorganized Time Waster,this is silly disorganized and a massive waste of time waiting around - we waited for the green line it came 2x was full - we gave up went back to the hotel - what a waste of time and money - I get how non-customer service oriented Portugal is - but damn this is next level IDNGAF. At the main terminal at the park - there is no organization it is mayhem no one directs you and there is no clear markings so ??? waste of time complete and total -,2
Uncomfortable and not worth the money.,"Bus would not start at cruise port. Eventually got going, suspension was bad on cobbled roads. Driver did not stop at points 1, 2 and 3 at all. Went through derelict streets with people sleeping in tents on the pavement - scary! Finally stopped at point 4 after a row with the driver. He began to shut the rear door before I got off and hurt my hand. €26 each was a rip off! Commentary was useless via earphones. After wandering around we found a nice restaurant fortunately and took a taxi back to the port for €5!!!! Don't know how many people he left behind by not stopping at the first 3 points. Nightmare!",1
Why drive a tour bus when nothing works,"The guides didn't work, the driver was very unfriendly and we had to wait 40 minutes in the blazing sun until we finally got going.",1
Don’t waste your money,"I have been on man city hop on hop off tours, but this one was awful. Although we’d booked on line, you couldn’t use the QR code unless you exchanged it at their office. That involved a tram ride to get there followed by a very long queue in the full sun of already dissatisfied customers. Bus stopping places weren’t clear, no earphones, but for those that had them, the commentary wasn’t working or out of sync. We took just one ride. My advice is don’t waste your money on this bunch of cowboys!!!!",1
AVOID AVOID AVOID,"AVOID its total pants. We booked through an online option. Despite having a QR code you can’t use this to get in the bus. You have to go the the ticket office miles from the waterfront area . Get their paper ticket with a QR code oh and wait in the general line as if you don’t have a ticket. So you can only board at the start. Utter rubbish, totally disorganised and no communication or signage for the buses, routes, times, stops etc. Not hop on and off total waste of money. We gave up waiting for a bus that runs when it wants so wasted €22. We got the general public transport back for €2 all the way from Belém to the main square. I suggest you just use the ordinary bus.",1
Crap tour,"Do NOT waste your time or money.
Bloody aweful.
Late. Slow. Poor commentary. Walking is quicker, nicer and Wikipedia more informative.",1
Bad experience,"We miss the day of the tour due to confusion of the day that we have our tour.We were late in checking in at our hotel that we were not able to come.
We notified viator and we requested a refund but we were denied.So I felt bad that we lost the payment and unable to go to Fatima.We came all the way from Canada and missed our tour and money as you did not give any co sideration.",1
Not recommended GRAYLIME LISBOA bad service,"Bad service, buses always full, frequency of passage greater than 30 minutes, unfriendly staff. Much better by taxi or bus…. AND ON TOP EXPENSIVE",1
Terrible Awful service,"AVOID- terrible, terrible service. Very infrequent buses. Buses frequently full so you can’t get on when they do come so please save your money and either go on a private tour or use public transport.",1
Tour Guide was rude,"The trip itself was not bad but the tour guide was extremely rude. Time was not well distributed among places. 2 hours in Fatima and 20 minutes at the Batalha. Batalha is huge and beautiful, when I mentioned to her that only 20 mins was not enough she said to stsy and get a hotel. I think the experience would be much better with another tour guide.",1
Do not go - save your money,"Cruise visit? Save your money.!
Bought a ticket in terminal. Was told it wouldbe a 2 hour trip - lasted 3!! Had no time to hop off and info incorrect and/or out of sync. Very disapointing route and a total easte of money.",1
Disappointing experience,"We have been on several hop on, hop off bus tours and this one was extremely poor. There are 4 routes, green, blue and red and purple (red and purple are the same route, but in reverse direction). What you are not told when you book is the buses are one an hour. Bus timings at stops are unreliable, so we arrived at stop for Mostario dos Jaronimos, on time, without realising that we must have just missed a bus, which came early. Waited an hour! In other locations (Cadiz), it is possible to track the buses.
The interchange for all routes is bus stop one, but times are not particularly well co-ordinated, so you can arrive on a red route bus, and then have to wait 45 minutes for a blue route bus to leave.
Narrative on headphones not particularly good. Lots of music!",1
Go only Nazare & Obidos..Dont go Fatima & Batalha,"Go only Nazare & Obidos
Dont go Fatima & Batalha

Tour company doesnt give phone numbers of their staff for coordination for pick up nor they share number during trip

They took break of 30 mins before reaching Fatima which was unnecessary

Dont go Fatima at all unless you are religious person
Dont go Batalha if u r not fond of church

Spend more time at Nazare..Tour company gives only 30 mins but you can spend more than 1 hour at Nazare viewpoint. You can also go down to beach which tour company doesnt take us

Tour company gave only 45 mins at Obidos. It is beautiful place where u can spend 1.5-2 hours…

Tour company dropped us at Rossio but they didnt give us pick up from rossio . They called us far place which was away from our apartment

Tour company wasted 30 mins as they started bus late just because the staff didnt have proper coordination or number/ count of passengers. Bus should leave on time even if other passengers are late

Tour company wasted another 15 mins at loo break for waiting couple who came late.

Tour company should adhere to timings. They need to have proper planning & coordination",2
"Horrible, Not worth the money spent.","Horrible!! Bus got stuck on a side street. The bus was packed, had a hard time finding a seat. We spent more time sitting going nowhere than seeing the sights. This was not worth the money spent. DON'T DO IT!!",1
Bloody awful,"27 euro each for absolutely NO COMMENTARY or idea where in Lisbon we might be……….have NEVER experienced any hop on/off this bad, been to 48 countries, says a lot!!!! DO NOT BOTHER…..",1
SERVICE SUCKS,"Service Sucks!! Buses are extremely infrequent!
We waited the blue line for 2 hrs on points 11 and 12, and the bus never came. Information about stations is also full of errors. A total waste of money!!",1
SERVICE SUCKS,"This service really sucks!!! Lines are EXTREMELY infrequent as a consequence you can waste hours and hours of valuable time waiting for a bus to come. They have an app with bus stops but indications about stops are full of errors.
A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!",1
CITYRAMA GREYLINE - TERRIBLE!!!,"CITYRAMA GRAYLINE (blue bus) : ESPARRO!
Very polite employees both at the sales counter and in the call center. HOWEVER, make no mistake! TERRIBLE service!!!!!! Orange line takes more than 1 hour to pass each point; Blue line, theoretically more frequent, however, it takes more than 40 minutes to stop at the stop, with an unattractive route (long way to stop at a tourist spot). It was extremely IRRITATING to see the yellow Bus and the CitySightseein (red bus) stop NUMEROUS times at our stop and the blue bus (GRAYLINE) didn't show up. Finally, we lost the money because we started to travel by other means. Part of the city of Porto is under construction due to the metro and some stopping points have been suspended. In addition to not notifying us, the application has not been updated. In short, the physical map says one thing, the app another and the website another. Maybe it makes up for the other companies (from what we saw, the yellow bus and red bus stops are very frequent), but GREYLINE, NEVER AGAIN!!!!",1
Failed to stop,"The bus failed to stop & we got a taxi instead. We had a day at the beach & when we decided to return we waited at the pick up point. The bus came along & sailed right passed. Very annoying, as they’re only every 30 minutes. We complained at the point where we bought the ticket, but this fell on deaf ears. Choose one of the other two, red / yellow lines instead.",2
There are better tour bus companies in Lisbon,"iPhone app kept crashing.
Location of buses on the app spotty.
Some stations were not properly marked (am I waiting for a bus that will never show up?)

Went to Caiscai and got stranded because no buses were on line at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday. There are no schedules anywhere. Online or elsewhere.

Was never able to validate my ticket. Driver always had to look at the receipt.
Some drivers drove like they were angry. Jack-Rabbit starts. Slamming on the brakes. Constantly honking the horn.
20% of the fuided tour devices on buses were non-functional.
Long waits to “hop-on”

Route do cover a lot of ground.

Yellowbus is better transportation . Ran much more frequently",2
Avoid - explore other tours,"Explore your options first. Got on at cruise terminal. 40 minutes before we set off. Did tour but didn't get off. Got to final stop (number 1) but needed at stay on until stop 2 to be in centre and near shuttle pick up point. Too far to walk (half an hour) with elderly relative. Headset said we could stay on. Unbeknown to us red line changed to blue line and we were stuck on bus for another hour straight back to cruise terminal. No option to explore centre. Driver not helpful. Said colleague had explained but no-one had informed the upstairs passengers. Lots of other passenger complaints showed that we weren't the ones to have made a mistake. So many options for tours - look at other options. Driver said he was hot, tired and hungry!!! Aren't we all.",2
Complete waste of money,"Total waste of money on the green line. Very few buses and when they finally arrive they are full. Rip off moneywise as well, 22 euros for a trip which will cost you 8 euros by your own driver with an Uber for example. No office or place to complain.",1
"This tour is pretty bad, I don’t recommend.","We got the Sintra deluxe tour through Grey Line. They were suppose to pickup and drop off at hotel. They dropped us up at the bus square (not hotel) and told everybody on the bus that they are on their own. We took a Uber back to hotel. Second issue, they talked in Portuguese but other languages are weak and skipped. Sometime they speak so fast no one understand the guide. The guide is useless and not helpful, we can’t ask questions inside the bus, guide does not seem to care about the tourists. When they drop us to a site, we have to figure out everything on our own.
We did tons of tours around the world, but this one is a big no no! Chose another group!",1
"To forget, money wasted","Bus without air conditioning, in August! Downstairs or on the front seats upstairs we were dying of heat without air, the seats in the sun to be cooked. A lady felt sick from the heat during a stop and the driver didn't even move.
Terrible audio quality, completely useless audio explanation because the bus travels too fast and it is not clear what the description refers to.
They advertised a bus every 20 minutes, we waited even 1 hour for one to arrive.
To forget, money wasted.",1
A not so guided tour…,"The places we visited were beautiful but the guided tour wasn’t that guided, as our tour guide left us alone in the various places of the Sintra deluxe (green) tour. Literally told us to go alone and meet her again at the pick-up spot X time later.

The guide was supposed to speak French and English but she spoke well only Portuguese and French, her English was acceptable at best , and that reflected on the quality and quantity of the information given (very poor in English).

All of that could have been better with a tour guide that wasn’t so obnoxious; It literally transpired that she couldn’t stand any of us, and we were in the way between her and her home.

So don’t expect a guided tour, but just a transport from Lisbon to Cascais, Sintra and the Castle of Pena, and back. A little pricey if you ask me :-)

The driver was a pro, though, navigating through every situation like a piece of cake. Thanks George!",2
Not as advertised,"Only half of the headphone connections worked on the first two buses we used.
No commentary on the 6 bridges boat tour.
Currently watching the blue route bus tracker from the stop at Serralves, but the bus just rerouted by continuing along Av de Boavista rather than following advertised route.",1
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"More than 1 hour waiting with my children for the bus. The application it's useless. Very difficult to download and impossbile to get information about the buuses. After one hour and half waiting with a hot day, we had to take a taxi. Conclusion: we paid 100 euros for all of us and were able to use it only for some stops.",1
"Commentary: Terrible audio, many seats just did not work and out of sync.",The driver was quite unfriendly. The audio on the headphones was poor. The commentary was not synchronized. Stopped working altogether halfway through. Tried to fix it and missed whatever we were to see. We asked the driver if a certain stop was a certain number and he responded “Yes”. It turned out it was a wrong stop. Don’t waste your money. Just do some research and make a list of places and learn about them and then just get a taxi or Uber to take you around. You can download info about any city on Vox City for a few dollars and it will give you a similar commentary as you drive along. Or just pin various places on Google maps.,1
Inadequate commentary,Definitely the worst hop on hop off bus trip I’ve ever done. The commentary was sparing and totally inadequate. Some of the inner city stop numbers were incorrect. No air conditioning.,1
Avoid,"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. There are other bus tours in town. On the first bus the audio did not work at all. After several passengers complained they sent another bus. On this bus some of the audio connections worked but at least half did not.

Only use Gray Line in Portugal if you want a guided tour with no guide.",1
"Beware of Scammer, Cityrama in Lisbon","Cityrama & Holiday Inn Continental (Rua Laura Alvis) sold us the tour tickets, only to find out that Cathedral was closed and one cannot go inside Belem. I was categorically advised that we could see all the places with the purchased tickets.

I complained and followed up with a few messages, but nothing doing. We were scammed. Avoid these two places, as I feel both parties are guilty and taking no accountability for the fiasco.",1
Worst experience ever - Don‘t use this Bus Line - You will regret it immediately,Worst experience ever! Entertainment System mostly broken! NO German Language on bord - they promised they should be! Asked to get our Money back immediately - don’t give a F*k! Thanks for absolutely nothing!,1
Waste of time and money!!!,"Shocking tour! Bought voucher in a shop. €30 each, total €60 for a 3 line tour. Had to wait an hour to start as the first bus was full. Used red line to get off at stop 11 where the driver told us we needed to wait for the orange line bus to get to Cascais. We waited two and a half hours, no orange line bus!! Waited another 30mins to get a red line bus back to where we started so spent the whole day on a bus or waiting. The commentary was terrible too. We really wanted to visit Cascais but never got there as we were only staying for 2 nights in Lisbon! Spent most of this tour sat on pavements waiting for buses!!! Stay away from this tour! Total waste of time and money!!!",1
Lisbon sightseeing (gray line cityrama) - péssima experiência,Péssima empresa de hop on hop off. Ônibus com pouca frequência. Funcionários mal humorados. Fazem os turistas aguardarem em fila no sol!!!! As duas outras empresas tem frequência e estruturas melhores (citysightseeing e os ônibus amarelos).,1
Daylight robbery,"Booked this whilst on a cruise. No information given. Audio guide not working properly (and was very poor anyway).
One of the main stops was blocked off for the day, the company must have known.
So a 25 minute detour to get back on track. This meant that arrival at change over point was delayed and there wasn’t enough time to do the second half. As it was every hour impossible to get off and get back to the shop on time.
None of this was explained. Daylight robbery.",1
"Bad. Save your money. Walk, take a tuk tuk or public transport","We should have read the reviews and saved our money. This was the worst Hop on bus we have been on. Very confusing as the narration didn't tell you what stop you are coming to and no announcement from the driver. Ofen, he just did not stop . It was very hard to follow and no information when the bus would return. The app was no help
Narration was limited and boring. Mostly filled with annoying music.
The driver was unhelpful and couldn't understand English.
In the end, we got off and walked.
SAVE YOUR MONEY ..take a tuk tuk or tour.",1
"Appalling, disgraceful Hop on Hop off Bus Tour!",My family and I were on a cruise ship and Lisbon was our port of call in June 2023.We queued for about 30 mins waiting on the next bus. There was a lot of people waiting to board the bus in a very disorganised way. Two girls were selling tickets. The bus turned up with very limited seating one of the ticket sellers checked if there was seating. We were sold tickets €108 for the 4 of us. We tried to board the bus and it soon became obvious that there were no seats. We were told to get on the bus by the ticket seller and we’re told seats would become available as soon as people disembarked. The driver was a very rude ignorant man and shouted for us to board we were apprehensive as no seats. We boarded reluctantly and went to the back of the bus. We were offered no headphones or maps. The driver proceeded to drive recklessly clearly angry his bus was full.I was standing at the double back doors unaware they would open at some stage. I was trying to steady myself. After about 15 minutes the bus stopped and the doors opened catching my right thigh causing me extreme pain and leaving my leg very red and bruised. I reported this to Customer Services on my return home from our cruise requesting a full refund as we did not get the experience of hop off hop on. My email was answered in an unhelpful way I have since sent another 2 emails and no reply. This tour company should not be selling tours for buses that have no seating. My experience was terrible and for that reason I will be pursuing my refund through other means.,1
Don’t waste your money on this!!,Totally waste of money and time. You will very limited information about what you pass on your 2 hour trip around the city. Book a tuk tuk instead.,1
Do NOT book with Cityrama,"Do NOT book with Cityrama Gray Line.
They are a SCAM.

My hotel booked a day tour with them.

They gave me the incorrect pick up location.

I arrived at the location they told me, and I quickly realized no one was there and called the company.

They told me that they gave me the incorrect pick up location and I should go to their main office to join the tour 15 minutes away. They said that they would wait for me.

I paid for a car to take me to the new location. When I got there, the office said the tour left, and they didn’t wait for me, and they can NOT help me.

I missed my tour to Sintra and had the worse day because of it. I had to pay for transportation back to my hotel.

I contacted customer service, and they said it was not their fault that they gave me the WRONG information and they can’t do anything to compensate me or do anything for them giving me FALSE information. They ruined my trip.

Cityrama has NO customer service, abd LIARS, and a scam.

There are other tour companies. Be smart and do NOT travel with them.",1
Rubbish Tour,"We took this tour without reading the reviews.
It was a waste of time and money. The commentary was out of sync with the buildings/monuments we passed and it stopped working for the entire second half of the trip. It was so disappointing. Shame on Gray Line for this bad service and lazy effort at producing a decent, insightful commentary. The red route was really poor, we saw as much from the train line as we arrived into Lisbon from Cascais. Most of the audio was made up of bland commentary. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this tour.",1
Très mitigé,"Très déçu par cette expérience. Nous avons pris en famille le ticket pour 48h. Les bus sont trop peu fréquents. Heure d’attente en chaque rotation, ce qui fait perdre énormément de temps entre chaque visite. De plus l’audio guide ne passe que de la musique donc aucun intérêt pas de commentaire sur les monuments
Le circuit proposé dessert trop de passage sans intérêt culturel. La numérisation n’a aucun dans logique et le site en ligne pour voir les stations n’est pas mis à jour. Nous avons attendu une heure à la station qui devait être la 24 pour voir notre bus passer devant nous sans s’arrêter et avons dû marcher vers une autre station pour refaire le tour des monuments déjà vu avant de repartir dans la bonne direction. Vraiment l’organisation est à revoir. Seul point positif le ticket 48h donne accès à une balade en bateau sur le Douro et à la cave de Porto à villa de gaia",2
Bus Cityrama da evitare,"Pessima esperienza, come le altre 2 compagnie concorrenti in città offre ad un prezzo di ben 26 euro il giro in pullman di 2 percorsi ( potendo salire e scendere quando si vuole ) cittadini ascoltando ( in teoria) le informazioni storiche e turistiche di Lisbona. Avendo usufruitoin altre occasioni di altre compagnie posso dire che Cityrama è la peggiore in quanto l'audio sul pullman non sempre funziona ( altri viaggiatori si lamentavano) e il personale sempre scocciato e indisponente. Consiglio di rivolgersi alle compagnie concorrenti tanto il prezzo è uguale",1
Waste of time and money,"Respect frequency. Out of 3 times we took the bus, 2 of them waited almost an hour. As I'm writing this review I have already waited more than anhour for the boat at Belem. No signs of it.",1
Not for us,"The tour guide was really nice and gave us a lot of information during the day which we enjoyed!
But: from the tour itself we imagined something differently. From the Living Tours tour description we had the impression that the time would be equally divided with the four stops. Unfortunately it was mainly a tour to Fatima, with a (from our point of view waste of time) stop of 30 mins at a tourist shop. We left Lisbon at 9 am, and left Fatima (which was the first stop) at 2.15 pm. Therefore there was not much time left to explore the other villages. If your main interest is to the see Fatima then this tour is for you, otherwise we can not recommend it.",2
hop hop hop somarello...!!,male...molto male. aria condizionata assente a luglio... orari inprecisi e non indicati in nessuna fermata. se guardi la app ti fanno capire che puoi fare i bilgietti on line...falso: ti fanno una prenotazione che poi devi convertire in biglietto ad un chiosco sperduto... salvo poi scoprire che i biglietti puoi farli anche nel bus con l'operatore... le altre compagnie hanno bus più frequenti e si vedevano passare molto più spesso,1
Terrible Experience,"Do not use this bus line. Poor customer service, poor audio equipment, and very poor signage on where to catch the bus. The signage and location did not always match the info in the brochure, especially for the orange line. A bus driver drove right past us while we were standing at the spot designated on the map and wagged his finger at us. There was no Grayline sign there, but it showed the location on the map. We walked to another so called Grayline bus stop, according to the map, again no bus sign. The only way we figured it was a stop was someone else was also there. Luckily a bus arrived after a very long wait. Save your money and go with one of the other bus companies in Porto to be guaranteed a better experience.",1
Zéér slecht,"Hop-on hop-off bus ticket, met Burmeister port tour en de bruggen tocht over de Douro belandde letterlijk in het water. De port tour wad uitstekend echter onze boottocht om 18.30 uur ging niet door. Bij de valreep werd dit door de kapitein medegedeeld. Alle ticket Offices gesloten en onze laatste dag. Gelukkig op het nippertje een boottocht reserveren via een andere organisatie.",1
Een zeer vervelende trip,"Het enige compleet geef ik de minibus chauffeur. Tour begeleidster Annabelle een onvriendelijke en bazige vrouw. Airco functioneerde niet goed. Wat een mooie Trip moest zijn, werd voor veel passagiers een ongezonde ervaring.",1
Diese Unternehmen zu wählen war ein grosser Fehler,"Einfach mies! Hop-on hop-off tour mit der red line in lissabon war schrecklich. Nach dem halben Tag entschied das Unternehmen nicht mehr bis ans Ende der Strecke zu fahren. Bei 33 Grad haben wir 2 Std auf den Bus gewartet,der nicht kam. Ende vom Lied: mit taxi zum Hotel.. wer also gern für veraltete Busse mit Musik anstatt Infos über die Stadt doppelt zahlt, ist hier richtig!",1
Do not use this Hop on - Hop off service,"The worst hop on - hop off service we’ve ever used. Aggressive driver who shouted and gesticulated at passengers when they asked to get off whilst failing to stop at numerous points on the so called tour. No information from the person we bought the tickets from so no idea what route we were on and at one point, having downloaded the app, it looked like we weren’t on either the Red or Blue route…slightly worrying. First stop was approximately an hour after we set off from the cruise terminal at which point we escaped and decided to walk back. Complete waste of €27 each, which in itself was expensive. On returning to the cruise terminal, guess what, all of their staff had vanished. DO NOT USE!!",1
Underwhelming,Pretty underwhelming experience. The information on the bus via earphones wasn't very rich in content. It was also very limited. An hour long bus ride you could've done by spending the day just walking.,2
Avoid this tour,"We sat on the bus for about 20 mins with no head phone commentary most of the head phone connections did not work. Then found a couple that did. After about 50 mins my partner did not feel well ( we think a bit of dehydration. We saw an area with lots of cafes and thought we could get off to get some water. ( after all it is a hop on hop off service ) We were sitting stationary in traffic for about 5 mins and said we need to get off. The driver was very curt and told us we could not and need to move backward behind the red line. I tried to explain we need to get off to get some water as my partner was feeling unwell. still no positive response. By this time my partner was quite unwell and feeling faint. She sat and was holding on to the support bar looking very unwell. I tried to explain we need to get off to get some water still no get behind the red line. My partner sat a little way back to get some support from the upright bar and was now looking quite pale I stayed looking for a cafe that was near a stop where we could get some water. Without walking too far. Our driver was on another planet. Just no regard for us or any other passengers for that matter. While he nonchalantly drove the bus for the next 15 / 20 mins continually chatting away to someone at the other end of his iPhone. His earphone was plugged in to his smart phone and he did not once stop chatting to the person at the other end for at least 20 mons or so. Other people getting on and off asking questions like what time is the last bus here, just a shrug of the shoulders. I was sitting next to him while my partner was feeling faint and I was looking out for a close by cafe to get some water.
I took this picture though his read view mirror. He was so engaged in his conversation on his phone he didn’t even notice that I was taking picture of him My suggestion to any traveler to Porto

Porto is a fantastic place and well worth a visit. The people are so friendly and the variety of culture is amazing this place have something for everyone. But please don’t waste your money on this trip it was awful.

Go to Porto and enjoy one of the best cities to visit in the world but please do not use this bus service particular if it’s driven by this man I really do not think he represents the generosity of the people of Porto.
Taken June 22nd 2023 orange route around 16.45.
We have done loads of open top bus tours around the world and they have all been good, except this one 1 out of 10 is being generous let along 1 out of 5",1
Stay away!,"Stay away! We paid the tickets with debit card and the sales person Julia Castro said that the payment didn’t work, so we paid cash. Later we found out in our bank statement that we were double charged and the company refuses to acknowledge and to refund us, although I sent proof of both payments.",1
No service at all,"Having waited for 45mins at the correct tour bus stop, the bus arrived and went straight past us and stopped 400 metres down the road to let passengers off. Although the driver knew we were at the correct stop he did not wait for us!! The bus was not full!!!",1
Better to walk and take public transportation,"Incorrect information, untrained staff that did the correct information on where to purchase tickets. To make matters worse traffic was hell, the audio narration was completely obvious. If you’re willing to just money away for what you could get on a city bus, don’t waste your time or money. I have taken these types of bus tours all over the world, this is by far the worst experience.",1
Worst experience ever,"If I could have gave them a zero I would have done this. Worst experience ever on this tour. The places to visit are not interesting except for few ones, they have buses every one hour while other companies have it every 10-20 minutes maximum. The drivers are in general impolite and not helpful. They were late even for the one hour wait we had. The earphones on some seats had just one language. This is not a serious company. Trust me do not take it! They convinced us to take the 24 hours tour. But with a bus passing every one hour believe me you need much more than the double to be able to see everything. Finally the comments in the earphones are uninteresting, very concise and not really useful. It’s not about money you will be loosing but something much more precious when you are visiting a new country! It’s about loosing time…",1
Not Hop on Hop Off Unless you want to wait an hour + for the next bus,"Disappointing! They should not call this hop on hop off. The busses run too infrequent to hop off to see a sight unless you are willing to wait a very long time for the next bus. They do not run in the 15-20 minute spaces as put in their literature. There were other HOHO busses that seemed to run much more frequent, wish we had chosen them. Also had to hop seats to find ones where audio worked. The red City Sightseeing Bus appeared to run much more often.",2
Good tour but difficult to be on alert when guide switched from one language to other.,"We booked this tour through Shore Excursion group for May 16,2023 and Cityrama Gray Line was the local provider. The bus audio system failed and bus departure was delayed for 30 min. The comments were in four languages. English speakers were minority group and comments in English were the last when bus already passed the points of interests. English speakers should look English only tours even if they are more expensive.",2
Orange route / Gray line tours Porto,"Five of us, all adults, took the Orange route tour from this company. This is the worst bus tour we’ve ever taken. The route turned out to be 50% uninteresting and the audio description was almost non existent. This route goes through the port warehouse district but failed to include any audio history about the area. The actual time in the warehouse area was only about 10% of the time in Gaia. The rest was through uninteresting apartment buildings. I would discourage anyone from taking this tour route. Better to walk across the bridge and walk up into the port warehouse area.",1
"Awful, boring tour.",Worst tour I have ever taken. The tour guide lacked any enthusiasm at all and I had a tough time understanding her. It was so boring. I ended up not paying attention because she was so low energy. And not enough time was spent in Sinatra. Avoid this company.,1
"Awful, never on time and a waste of money","Never on time where it says on the timetable ended up waiting for over an hour for 1 bus.
When on the bus tkmings for the information are always delayed and saying them at the wrong times. Majority of the time it's music you can barely hear. The red and yellow bus went past about 3 times before a blue bus arrived.
Better of using public transportation or users to get where you want to go cheaper and more reliable. I would like a refund?!",1
Terrible experience,"Had a terrible experience on this tour bus. There was a group of unacceptably obnoxious students about 40 of them who made the entire experience horrid!
Then our driver came to an abrupt stop where a few passengers, including my family members suffered minor injuries. They were not attentive nor supportive to anyone. Would no recommend going on this tour or using this bus company.",1
Não caia nessa Furada!!!,"A maior ""Furada"" !!! Os ônibus passam com muitas demoras e não tem horário certo !!
O audio sem muita informação e fora do tempo. Chegamos a desistir várias vezes pra não perder o dia !!!Tínhamos feito em Barcelona e Madrid e tudo foi perfeito!! Em Lisboa não funciona !!!Optamos por App BOLT .",2
Bad experience,"Bad experience- wasted time. We bought 48 hour tickets in Lisbon and this is the worst experience ever. The map we got from the company doesn't match reality, and we spent a lot of time finding where to get on the cramped buses. On board almost no information to get, and mostly music to hear the whole way. ridiculous",1
Wasted time,"wasted time!

Almost no information to get from the audio guide, and mostly music to hear the whole way. ridiculous",1
Awful,Steer clear of the Red Bus tours. There’s a reason why the Yellow buses are busier. We used the Belem line today and we were unsure how to get back to where we got on. I asked one of the ticket agents for assistance and boy was that a mistake. She was rude and disrespectful to a paying customer who obviously needed help. She was obviously more interested in chatting with her colleagues than providing assistance as per your recorded message on the bus. Buyers beware if you need help.,1
Nie mehr grey-line,"Schlechteste hopp-on-hopp-Linie, die wir jemals hatten. Viel zu wenig Busse unterwegs. Wartezeit bis fast 1 h. Die kleinen Busse für das Castell sind oft voll und bis dann der nächste kommt.........",1
Awful. Do not use.,"Was in Lisbon for two days and having had previous experience of the hop on hop off buses in other countries previously, I thought the 'Grey Line' bus would be an ideal way to see Lisbon, paying for a two day pass. First off, the paper map you are given is rubbish and the stops do not correspond with thise listed on the map. Secondly, the buses are infrequent and utterly out of sync with advertised times: most of the buses didn't turn up. I even downloaded the app hoping that this would give me a better idea when a bus would arrive. On the first day, I waited for the last bus to arrive for over a hour and a half, nearly giving up and getting a taxi. Eventually, the bus arrived but it was overpacked and so late in the day that we were driven straight to the bus terminal (I didnt even complete the red line) and then driven straight to the cruuse terminal. By the end of day, I had spent so much time waiting for the bus I gave up not bothering to use my pass for the second day. Total waste of money and time. Do not bother.",1
Das Geld ist es nicht wert,"Leider nicht zu empfehlen. Wir hatten uns ein 48 Stunden Ticket für 2 Linien mit der Greyline in Lissabon gebucht. Es war nicht möglich herauszufinden wann der nächste Bus kommt, so dass wir teilweise mehr als 30 Minuten warten mussten und dann fuhr der Bus auch noch an unserer Station vorbei obwohl wir genau davor standen und dem Busfahrer zuwinkten. Die App gab lediglich Auskunft darüber, wo die Stationen sind. Wenn man oben im offenen Bereich saß, waren die displays für das Audio so schlecht zu erkennen, um sich die richtige Sprache auszusuchen und nicht überall war deutsch dabei. Geschichtlich hat man nur sehr wenig erfahren. Schade, denn wir haben schon andere Hop on hop off Busse genutzt und gute Erfahrungen gemacht.
Da hätten wir uns lieber ein Ticket für 6€ für alle Busse, Metros und Bahnen geholt.",1
La pire expérience à surtout ne pas faire,"Voilà plus de 45 minutes que nous attendons avec plusieurs personnes à 7n arrêts aucun bus en approche aucune information la pire que nous ayons faite en expérience avec city tour

A NE PAS FAIRE

si vous ne voulez pas perdre votre temps et votre argent",1
Terrible company! (Citirama),Lousy bus service. Driver was wreck less. The stops were not where the maps indicated. Couldn't see anything. Traffic there is beyond terrible. Never again.,1
Awful Tour Avoid at all costs,"Awful Bus Tour , Doesn't actually stop.
Got on this bus to go out to the Aquarium on the blue route, somehow ended up waiting for 30mins where the cruise ships dock which is on the red and purple route.
Then headed towards the aquarium but the driver didn't stop at any stops, he just kept driving. Worst bus tour we've ever been on.
Can barely hear the headphones which was mostly random music anyway.
Disaster , avoid avoid avoid",1
Disappointing and Often Oversold,"I took Gray Line tours in Porto, Portugal and it was quite good, so when I later went to Lisbon I thought would be easy choice to use same tours in Lisbon.

Was wrong. Firstly there seems to be very few worthwhile stops in Lisbon compared to Porto. Plus it is more expensive, as there are more lines.

It gets way oversold, where busses come not often enough and they are full so people end up having to stand.

Lisbon gets hotter than Porto, so it can be very uncomfortable on the busses. Up top with no cover = sunburn on head. Downstairs no air conditioning so also very warm.

Just won't recommend them, would suggest just taking Lisbon's decent public transit to the places you want to see. Its also air conditioned while you get there.",2
Terrible Waste of Money,"I thought the Porto tour was poor until i got to Lisbon.
The waiting times were overlong and the commentary was awful bearing no relationship to the sights or stops and little or no effort to impact information.
The tour routes were not as shown and the original ticket purchased was not accepted by the driver requiring us to go to the terminus before we could start
and wasted 2 hours.
Also the green route was not operating at all on the first day we tried thus wasting even more time as no-one had given any information.
I have used my trip advisor account to give this report because i cannot find a way to
complain directly to Gray Line.",1
Not to recommend,"Keep your hands off the Gray line busses.
Routes in the flyer incorrect.
Waited 1 1/2 hours for a bus which did not show up.
German couple had the same experience.
Service line not responding.
In the morning they just want to sell tickets then they are gone. Info points closed in the afternoon.
Not recommended at all!!!!",1
Don’t Waste Your Money,"I have taken hop-on, hop-off bus tours in many countries. This one was THE WORST! The numbers on the map did not correspond with the numbers on the signs for the stops. The driver made very few stops. I had to change seats 5 times before I found audio with English (No, it was not on channel 6). There was almost no narration, only music. When the driver finally stopped the bus, everyone got off and agreed it was a terrible excuse for a tour bus. It was wasted money (27 euros).",1
La peor elección,"Realmente no gaste dinero y tiempo en este autobus. Hay otras compañias mejores. Los conductores son muy agresivos, no dan ayuda, las paradas están mal anunciadas. La espera es de 1 hora mínimo.... Realmente no vale la pena. No deberian permitir personas mal educadas, y agresivas para trabajar en turismo.",1
Don’t buy tickets on line,"Don’t waste time buying tickets on line. You still have to stand in line at the very small, very slow ticket line. The employees that stand around at the bus stops cannot print your ticket like what happens in other cities.",2
Don't Do It!,"Terrible experience, the bus was crowded, too hot and the pre recording didn't match the stops. Tried to get off several times during the trip and the bus driver would not stop long enough, nearly fell over when trying to get down the stairs to leave at a stop, when the driver gunned the engine. Also we were told our ticket was 24 hours long, but after going for lunch and coming back later that afternoon when the weather was cooler to get back on, there were no busses in operation and they were all gone. Staff was rude, agressive unfriendly and unorganized. Take our advice, negotiate and rent a tuk tuk instead, it will change your entire experience.",1
Evite,"Fui recebida com a má disposição e completo desinteresse pelo motorista da empresa Gray Line.
Grosseiro e imprestável.",1
Das Geld nicht wert.,"Teilweise zu überfüllte Busse. App empfehlenswert für die buszeiten funktioniert aber nicht immer. Ohne App ist einiges an Wartezeit vorprogrammiert.
Die Informationen sind dürftig. Ich glaub ich hab mehr Musik gehört als Infos. Wenn man ein alten Bus erwischt ist dir qualität der audioausgabe mangelhaft.
Ich fand Oriente Tour besser als die belem Tour. Belem für ich empfehlen zu Fuß zu erkunden.",2
Worst hop on hop off bus experience,"We took the red line tour which cost 22€ per person, what a complete waste of time and money. Had to stand in a queue for at least half an hour at each stop to board the bus as they seemed to be very infrequent. We had to stand on most occasions as the bus was so full which meant we couldn’t really see anything, they had ran out of headphones which would have been no use anyway as there was no where to plug them in while standing. We complained to one of the gray line employees but they weren’t interested once they had your money. We gave up half way round and ended up walking over an hour back to the centre. We have done a hop on hop off bus in many cities we have visited and this by far the worst I have ever been on. Saw nothing heard nothing and very hot and uncomfortable having to stand, not a relaxing experience in the slightest. Take my advice and take a Tuk Tuk a much more personal relaxing experience. Lisbon is such a lovely city but this tour is certainly not worth your time or effort, I would have given it no stars if I could.",1
Pior city,"Pior city tour Péssima experiência, não recomendo nunca. O pior hop on hop off que já fiz. Comprei o pacote completo, para as 3 linhas em 2 dias. No primeiro dia, a linha verde fez um caminho diferente para o castelo. Voltando ao ponto de partida, perguntei se os outras linhas estavam com o percurso correto e garantiram que sim. Embarquei para descer na praça do Comércio e não parou lá, foi direto p o parque das nações. Fui questionar o motorista e ele, MUITO GROSSO disse que a culpa era do trânsito que estava congestionado. No segundo dia, que faria a linha vermelha foi bem pior, fiquei por mais de uma hora no ponto, passaram ônibus de outras empresas e nada da gray line. Depois de tanto esperar, fui para a Torre de Belem de metrô e ônibus. Se souber que era tão ruim esse city nunca teria gasto meus 60 euros, pois comprei para 2 pessoas. HORRÍVEL",1
Don't waste your valuable tourist time and money,This bus tour was a complete waste of time and money. Bought a 2 line trip from hotel. Then had to line up in a long queue to exchange receipt for ticket at their office box. One line not operating so after some discussion got changed to another line. Had to line up in the heat for at least 20mins waiting for a bus - need shelter from sun and rain. The commentary didn't match the upcoming stops and very limited in information. The music was depressing. The bus was hot. We didn't use the second line as this operator is boring. We will go back to the original Hop On Hop Off bus - never disappoints.,1
Terrible service,"Horrible. Drivers don’t announce stops or even stop at them some of the times. Busses claim to pick you up every 30-40 minutes but frequently late. Audo on bus with headphones work less than half the time, and so much static you cannot understand the narrative. Don’t waste your money. Uber is your best option.",1
NO RECOMENDABLE,Al comprar el ticket esta mañana no te dicen que no se corresponde con las rutas del triplicó y solo subir te dicen que las rutas están cambiadas por causas ajenas. Cuando bajas como quieras encontrar de nuevo una parada misión imposible porque no se corresponden los papeles con la realidad.,1
Not worth it,"I honestly don't think the bus ride is worth it. If I had to do it again I'd take regular transportation or a tuck tuck to the sites of Belem, the monastery or the park. It's an overpriced regular bus service. Take the tram.",2
Má experiência!,"1.) Na minha opinião, os locais para apanhar autocarros não foram claramente indicados.
2.) Os tampões não funcionariam em vários lugares, parecia que algo estava preso em pontos de venda.
3.) A Wi-Fi não trabalhava no autocarro como anunciado, em todos!
Recomendo esta linha de turnê sobre o livro outra vez com esta empresa? Não!",1
Do not take it if you wish to use audioguide!,"Do not count on audioguide included. Buses are so old that audio system is not working. You will only hear some creaking sounds. As opposite to other cities, no phone download option exists.",1
Un auténtico desastre. Una timada.,"No hay espacio para todo lo que hay que mejorar: la guía no nos informó de casi nada, fue casi todo el viaje callada; nos cobraron los 14 euros de la visita al Palacio da Pena y no lo pudimos ver ni de lejos. No nos informaron de los motivos por los que no pudimos efectuar la visita al exterior del Palacio da Pena (el interior ya sabíamos que no íbamos a poder verlo, por causas ""ajenas a la compañía"", según reza su página web. Tanto en Estoril, como en Cascais, como en Sintra, la guía no nos acompañó casi nada. Simplemente nos decía la hora de vuelta y desaparecía. De todos modos, reclamaremos el importe correspondiente a la entrada al Palacio da Pena, que nos la cobraron.",1
Servicio terriblemente abandonado,"El 80% de los auriculares/ salidas de audio, no funcionan. No se respetan los horarios y es muy común que haya paradas donde te dejen esperando arriba del bus más de 30 minutos. El personal de la empresa parece estar en un conflicto sindical, pues no dan absolutamente ninguna explicación tras las demoras constantes. Muy muy mala experiencia.",1
Perhaps worth a one day activity.,"We opted for a one day hop on hop off Porto ( HOHO) red bus tour. It is good for either the red or blue routes. It was poor. The red bus HOHO was very confusing. They used both red and blue buses had multiple color named options for different routes. What made it confusing is that the red painted buses could be for the orange or blue routes , instead of red . You had to be sure to read the placard In The widow to know which route it. In other words a red bus Did not mean it was a red route. We errantly got on a red bus assuming it was a red route,but it was not ( it had a blue route placard I the window). I think there is a psychological term for this brain mismatch process that we fell victim to. The stops were not announced, had to focus on that which should not have been necessary.
If you do opt for a HOHO tour, I would suggest considering the yellow bus company, based only on the poor performance of the red bus HOHO. Also,only consider it to get a one day feel/overview of the city. It is not a good transportation option. Use Uber/taxi/bus,metro instead. If buying tickets plan to do so at the bus location/ stop; not a vendor as vendors can be problematic with ; cash only, up selling, misinformation, language, etc.",2
Disappointing red bus hop on hop off.,"Poor experience. We went on the Lisbon red bus hop on hop off. Traffic jams resulted in idle time. If you go, consider going later at nonpeak traffic times- but that is not a good use of time. The scripted narrative was not timed to match locations. Had a 30 minute wait at stop 1 when route was completed before the route continued. If you purchase tickets I recommend doing it at/on the bus. Other vendors can be problematic ( cash only, difficult in understanding options, etc. ). Only use hop-on hop off as a once thru overview of the city. It is not worthwhile to consider it as a second day transportation option, use metro/tram/bus/taxi/Uber instead. There are other hop on hop off type sightseeing busses which offer the same service, perhaps try a different one.",2
"Tjonge, wat slecht","Altijd leuk om een hop-on hop-off bus te nemen, voor een eerste indruk van een stad. Helaas niet bij Gray Line. Dat de oortjes maar half werkten is iets wat in dit soort bussen meer regel dan uitzondering is, dus dat is nog tot daar aan toe. Maar dat er vooral gedacht wordt aan het verkopen van tickets, zonder dat je er iets fatsoenlijks voor terugkrijgt, is toch echt déze vervoerder aan te rekenen. Hop-on hop-off op de Cascais-route? ,,Helaas, de bus is net weg, en er rijdt er maar één per dag heen en terug."" Dat noem ik geen hop-on hop-off, dat noem ik een excursie. Op een ander moment, bij één van de andere routes (ze hebben er vijf in totaal) zeker drie kwartier staan te wachten tot er eentje voorbijkwam. Helaas is er geen dienstregeling te vinden, ook niet iets simpels als wanneer de eerste en laatste bus van een lijn vertrekt. Wél is er een app die aangeeft waar de bus zich realtime bevindt (enige positieve dat ik kan noemen), maar het duurt soms een eeuwigheid voor die bus dichterbij komt. Dat komt misschien door verkeersdrukte, zei u? Nou, niet altijd. Hoe gaat het er dan aan toe op zo'n bus? We zaten in een Gray Line-bus die stopte om tickets te verkopen op een busbaan op een plek waar dat niet kon / mocht. Gevolg: een rij wachtende bussen achter ons, maar vooral wachten, wachten en nog eens wachten. Het duurde en duurde maar. Maar ook als er wél een halte is, duurt het soms érg lang bij de ticketverkoop op de bus. Kortom, meef stilstaan dan rijden.
Nee, Gray Line hop-on hop-off raad ik niemand aan. Zelfs zonder uitzicht (in een metrotunnel) kun je meer genieten dan van deze hop-on hop-off-ervaring. Vreselijk slecht, ergerlijk, gewoon niks. Wil je ergens komen en niet te veel tijd en geld verspillen, pak dan gewoon de metro, de tram of een reguliere buslijn.",1
Very disappointed,"We paid a lot of money for the Gray Line Hop on Hop off bus tour in Lisbon and were very disappointed. To begin with they didn’t complete a good third of the route which we were looking forward to. But the most disappointing part was the great lack of commentary. We spent most of the time listening to music rather than being informed about Lisbon. While there is time driving from point to point, the commentary could have easily continued to give us a broader knowledge of Lisbon and/or Portugal. Instead we had long stretches of just listening to music. This was not worth the 44 euros we spent.",1
Bad,"Very slow. Taking more than 5 minutes in some stops with no reason.
The system audio in the bus doesn’t work well. When it does: just a vey little explanation.",1
Very bad customer service,"Stops are not where its shown on the map, where taking a block away. My partner and I realised this and ran to get the bus, the bus stopped and when we were literally 2 meters from the bus they took off, despite de driver seeing us. The bus was NOT full. Buses are every 30 mins or more, much more. Poor customer service at the vending place and at the bus stop, definitely feels like the staff really do not want to be there! Eyes rolling at EVERY QUESTION!!!!! Very appaled and for anyone wondering why we got tickets if the service was this bad, we had unfortunately pre bought them at our hotel (Marriot Lisbon), this is the tour they sell, if staying there, defo do not buy from them.",2
"Greyline, absoluut geen aanrader in Lissabon","We hadden een ticket voor 3 dagen, oortjes werkten maar voor 50% van de tijd, arrogante mensen aan het onthaal, lieten ons staan aan een halte in Cascais, hun reden:'carnavalstoet en andere route genomen', geloven hun eigen leugens want de chauffeur kwam die avond voorbij in de andere richting en zag ons staan, gevolg trein en metro nemen, schadevergoeding niks. Ik raad deze organisatie in Lissabon aan niemand aan. Ze voelen zich superior in hun business. Maar zijn dit allebehalve...
Jammer, men laat zich kennen voor 10 euro schadevergoeding...",1
Way too much waiting!,"We bought a 24 hour hop on hop off pass with Greyline tours and did a whole lot of waiting for a bus to come - maybe once an hour. We’ve done these types of tours before - example in Dublin - and buses came every 10-15 minutes; and it was easy to find a schedule of when the bus was to come. Not in this case at all. Don’t waste your money. I’m f you want to get to Gaia from central Porto, walk across the bridge or get a tuck tuck or Uber. The orange line was also boring as it takes you through mostly residential areas - just get to the port houses please. The blue line was ok as we got to see some interesting sites, especially the Sea Changes sculpture. Disappointing.",2
Blue route disaster,"What a farce! Picked up the 1st bus as São Bento at 10:00. An hour later we had looped back to the same point before finally heading across the river. Boring for us but more importantly, such as silly loop - would work loads better if the bus went over the bridge first, done that side and then went through the old town of Porto.",1
Não vale a pena,"Compramos um pacote da lusanova que tinha este tour de uma manhã, ficou 36euros por pessoa, foi dificil achar a informação do horario de saida, pois o hotel não sabia, falava que era um tour por lisboa, e só passamos por alguns lugares e paramos na torre de bekem, monumento descobrimentos, museo coches ,uma andada em alfamas e no mosteiro de Jerônimos, depois fomos literalnente deixados no meio da praça do rossio e cada um se vira para voltar para o hotel, sem explicacoes, muito caro pelo que foi oferecido, os yellow card são melhores",2
Terrible service,Waiting over half an hour and no bus. When a bus did turn up it was full. Terrible service. Had to a taxi in the end. Avoid at all costs,1
Awful,"Don’t be duped by the girl sitting at the desk with all red photos… this is NOT the sight seeing hop on hop off bus tours, this is cityrama and it is an old bus with headsets that don’t work and very poor guides.
A waste of money",1
Horrível ! Pessima ! Pesadelo ! Porcaria ! Lixo !,"PESSIMA a pior empresa do MUNDO!!!! Não usem. Possuem só 2 ônibus funcionando (com sorte pois 1 sempre desaparece). A espera nos pontos são infindáveis! Fui pedir o dinheiro do segundo dia que não usei , e não tem mais ninguém para eu reclamar ou telefone para eu pedir o dineheiro de volta ! Não usem está empresa !!!!!!",1
Keinen Einbezug in die Stadt,"Diesen Trail habe ich nicht gemacht. Dafür die gleiche Art ""Sherlock Holmes"" in Regensburg. Dort bin ich einfach whallos herumgelaufen und habe virtuellen Dieben hergejagt, die Story war einfach nur dumm und vorhersehbar. Das schlimmste war, dass die Stadt nicht mit einbezogen wurde. Keine Fragen zu Sehenswürdigkeiten, keine wissenswerte Fakten, nichts dergleichen.",1
DO NOT PURCHASE,"Do not buy these passes! I have used City Sightseeing before in London and had a great experience. However, in Lisbon it was a completely different experience. We bought the 48hr tickets and were never able to use them. The app said there were no buses in transit for the entire day. I immediately contacted customer service and got a robot that said we would be back with you shortly. After not receiving a response, I sent an email instead of using their chat feature. It took a day to get a response and they said to just use the times listed and the bus would show up. Well, there goes over our 24 hours of our 48 hour tickets. They said they could not give us a refund. I told them that was not fair as the app was not working properly and they took so long to respond that it waisted such a significant portion of our tickets. They said I should have just waited for a bus or found one of their employees along the route. Such terrible customer service I had to file a complaint with my credit card company due to City Sightseeing incompetence. Just take public transportation, Uber, or walk, so much more efficient, easier, and better service.",1
Not fit for purpose,"So disappointed
Paid €30 each x 4
No commentary
The driver was so unhelpful
Don’t use this service
Blue line is like an industrial tour and with no sound is utterly unacceptable
I feel we have paid and been cheated",1
Waste of time and money.,"Don’t bother. We paid 33 EUR each for a 15 minute bus journey, then never found another bus stop to ‘hop-on’ again, despite spending hours walking around looking. Followed the map, tried several locations, saw buses and chased them to try find a bus stop, and when we found one, no bus for an hour. We wasted more time looking for poorly signed bus stops than anything else. Only plus point was we saw loads of Lisbon on foot chasing buses!!!",1
Cannot hear the audio,"This review is for CITYsightseeing not Lisbon Sightseeing, different companies. We chose Citysightseeing as it provided for 3 bus routes with one on a small bus that provided a tour of the smaller narrower streets of Lisbon.

This bus tour is mediocre at best.

We headed to the main stop and it was easy to find and locate. We rode the Blue line first as that was departing soon. The drive was fine BUT the audio was terrible. There is music playing constantly on all of the channels with audio voiceover when certain sites are being described. Whomever thought it was a good idea to have music playing in the background with an audio voice over of descriptions needs to have their hearing checked. The background music, which is a woman singing, results in the inability to hear or decipher what is being said. It is loud and when the audio portion is played the music does not stop. Maybe if it was muzak it would make sense, but someone signing (sometimes in the same language) with audio is being played makes zero sense. The music is as loud as the audio voice over.

The red line was perhaps moderately better as the voice over was a little louder but the music remained a distraction.

The green line was a huge disappointment. The audio did not work. The driver said he told the company but they had not fixed it. Why they would have a bus in operation without the audio portion working makes no sense. It was nice to drive around and see the skill of the driver navigating the narrow and curvy streets.

Overall, not worth the money. Do not do it.",2
No English audio-guide on uptown bus,Did the red line Belem first and the audio guide worked (they could have talked more and sung less) - then we went for the «uptown line» and the commentary in English was non-existent. The final bus-ride was then considered our most boring (2 hours) sightseeing experience ever.,2
worst we've had of this kind of bus tour,"we've been on hop on hop off tours somewhat like this in other cities and have had good experiences. This is the worst of this kind of tour we've been on. They are there waiting passengers coming off cruise ships. First it took about an hour from the time we sat on the coach until we sat on our actual tour coach up in the center of the city. The narration was pretty scant. Lots of just uninteresting music. We bailed out at stop 13 and then walked back to see sites of interest. It was easy walk back to the cruise ship. I can't recommend this tour experience, but I understand that for someone else it might not be so bad. Interesting to have had music played through the radio system during much of the ""tour""",2
Waste of money,"The buses are regular but the audio guide was very poor in comparison to the city sight seeing tours in other Countries. It repeated the same thing multiple times, talked about things that were not around and missed what appeared to be important sights. The blue line in particular was a waste of time as it didn't really go to any places of importance and again the audio guide was useless and we didn't learn anything from it. I definitely would not recommend this in Lisbon.",2
Stifling hot bus,"Horrible. 105 Fahrenheit in Lisbon and no a/c in the bus. Customers comfort doesn't even hit their radar screen. Audio ""tour"" was virtually non-existent, uninformative and sparse.",1
Bad experience,"It was a nightmare, a waste of time
No audio broadcast on the history of the city than music. I was disappointed I strongly advise against.",1
Not recommended,"No air conditioning, audioguide hardly available (only music, little info). No sun protection upstairs. You're just stuck in traffic",1
Time wasting experience,"I wish I could give less than one star. We've spent so much time sitting waiting at stops while they've sorted out ticket issues. We've Just spent 45 minutes at stop one. They don't seem to understand the premise of hop on hop off. We really regretted buying the tickets, they weren't cheap either! The price definitely didn't match the service. AVOID!;",1
Try Another Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Company,"The only good thing I can sayabout City Sightseeing bus tour is that our bus driver was amazing - navigating narrow streets and sharp turns.

Everything else was terrible. (1) The audio equipment is ancient. Had to change seats 6+ times to find audio that worked. (2) The audio narration was less than minimal. For 2 hours of seeing Lisbon, the narrator spoke 15-20 minutes tops. I didn't learn much. (3) The bus was ancient, too. Super bumpy and slow.",2
Don’t do it!,"This hop-on/hop-off bus is the worst!
Go with Grayline or Yellow bus:
Narration ports were broken. Wait times were ridiculously long. I saw several Grayline and Yellow buses come and go before one of the City sightseeing buses would come by.
Don’t waste your money or your time with this company.",1
Disappointed and left behind.,"So disappointed, put up with them driving to fast around the city and not seeing the points of interest, put up with broken headphone plugs.
But to be told the 1505 pick up spot is no. 2 in Cascais, where we were dropped off, then to be left behind as they did not go this was too much.
I rang them when I saw the bus was nearly back in Lisbon only to be told they sent me a message, that did not arrive, I had the app. on all day, and then told I had to wait another 3 hours for pick up did not sit well with me.",2
Worst hop on hop off in Lisbon,Was told buses are regular a bus will be 6 minutes. What a joke Lisbon sight seeing/Greyline is far better don’t waste your money or time.,1
Horrible.,"Bad service, lack of information. We even had to resort to an uber at the end of an hour of waiting for the call followed in paregem nume 6 of the blue line. Not recumendo of all",1
try another bus company instead,"Nog enough buses, had to wait a very long time at stops. Also buses did not respect timelines ( did not arrive on time). Audio guide had very limited information on the city, you ear more music then anything else. Suggest “GreyLine” bus company instead - many buses and more organized.",2
"Awful, do not take this bus tour","Genuinely the worst tour bus experience I’ve ever had in any city in the world. Doesn’t stick to any timetable, hardly any information shared via the talking guide, and what was shared was bare minimum. Left waiting over an hour at the palace, for us to get on to bring us back to the centre and our ticket was 1 minute expired so we weren’t allowed on and were stranded at the Palace in the heat, when we had timed it well, even accounting for a couple of minutes delay.",1
Definitely would not recommend,"The recorded commentary was very poor indeed, especially on the blue line. The complete tour took about 1hr 45mins and the information about where we were and what we were passing was very scanty. Just a snippet here and there. I’ve been on similar tours in other cities, where the commentary is almost non-stop. Furthermore, music playing through the headphones was continuous and it was very annoying. You had to keep the earphones in so as not to miss one of the infrequent pieces of information, which meant that there was no respite from the Portuguese music. The music was still playing in the background when there was information, which made it difficult to hear. The little green line bus goes up to the castle. There was no information about the castle and hardly anything on the way up and down. The red line gave a bit of information at most of the stops, but just a couple of sentences. Very disappointed with the experience and for 33€ I would have expected to have learnt more about Lisbon.",2
"Не рекомендую автобусные экскурсии компанией ""City Sightseeing Lisboa""","Good day. We bought a tour from your company on a double-decker bus at the port. I was told that there is an audio guide in Ukrainian. But to my great regret, the guide does not work in Ukrainian. Also, the bus follows an unclear route, not indicated on the map issued when purchasing tickets. I will add that the audio guide suddenly turns on and off, and when the description of some object begins, it is not clear from which side of the street you need to look for this object in question. In general, my impressions of this incomprehensible train on the bus are very negative. I cannot recommend this to other people.",1
Learned Almost Nothing About Lisbon,Frankly disappointed with City Sightseeing in Lisbon. Generally do use this company's buses to get acquainted with a city. Learned almost nothing from the narrated Red Line tour. Generally had music in my earphones most of the tour. Useless. Lots of money for little value.,2
Abysmal,Paid a lot of money for day pass with oceanarium. Blue bus arrived an hour late so we missed our booked slot at oceanarium. Then no bus back for whatever time so had to pay for an uber back. Total waste of money as only seems to be one bus every hour. We never did get on any other route so a 15 minute journey cost us £60,1
Avoid this transport company,"Very bad experience, they are thieves and incompetent.
Lack of seriousness, they left us on the side of the street without wanting to take us.
Run away from this company!!!!",1
Worst choice of bus Drop on Drop off,"Frankly disappointed! The music at the same time as the comments so we didn’t hear well then the comments not synchronized so we don’t understand everything
We had a lot of trouble finding a bus stop then after calling, we were asked to go to the website which is apparently up to date
Finally found, but waited 50 minutes in full sun while the bus must pass every 40 minutes so looked for the error.... asked on What’a app and I was confirmed that it arrived in 5’
Frankly expensive paid for poor service
This is the last time I use their company",2
No recommendation,"The most wasted 29€ I ever invested. We went 30 minutes with blue line, stopped in nowhere to catch an uber for going back to the city. Then I wanted to try red line, waited 30 minutes on station 4 to catch a bus (while other companies passed two times). I left on 6 searching for a bus on 12, but I couldn’t find the station. Even the driver couldn’t help me. Then I catched an Uber again to go where I wanted. Sorry, but I can only give one star for that fail. Please use the historical tram. It is cheaper and you will see more in shorter time",1
If I could give zero I would,"Having used this company in other locations I thought I would be getting a good service but don’t be fooled. List of issues:
1. Stops are tucked away in hard to find locations.
2. Frequency of the buses is abysmal and not as stated in the advertising.
3. Interactive map online doesn’t match with the paper map they give you.
4. Audio is limited when you are on the bus, most of the time it played a woman singing.
5. Buses are packed.

In conclusion I wouldn’t waste your money on this service. There are far better ways of getting around the city. If you want to maximise your time instead of standing waiting for buses, don’t use city sightseeing in Lisbon.
Absolute joke and waste of money.",1
A disrespect to customers,A company bosta. The only proof of admission is a paper. If you miss it (which they themselves admit happens frequently) you will be without the ride. Bad care and after-sales policy. Don't buy with them. Take public transport or a bolt to go to places and save time and irritation,1
Why can’t they do better?,"We love hop on hop off busses. When you want to see a lot in a busy city quickly, they are ideal.
Why is it that City Sightseeing in Lisbon can’t even get the basics right - start the tours at the time you say, have the commentary working, run a decent queuing system. The irony is that the Gray Line company which operates from the same location with almost identical busses seems to manage all of this so much better. It sometimes seemed as though the service was being run for the employees rather than the customers.
PS - and the commentary when it does work is poor.
PPS - and why play that interminable music ALL the time, it’s irritating",2
Andreta Oliveira,"The tickets was sold, the service as claimed by the staff member was not provided (the service was not provided at all at the end). The expenses was not reimbursed. Miserable attitude was demonstrated. The official claim through consumer protection agency will be submitted.",1
Expensive and not very premium.,"Mixed bag.
On the plus side the buses are frequent so you can get off and back on easily, and there was always a seat on the top. Good paper map given to you once you're on.
On the minus side the earphones usually don't work, the commentary is pretty poor anyway, the green line bus has zero suspension and hard plastic seats, the website is infuriating - the map is impossible to find and when you do you can't zoom or scroll without losing it again, and it's quite expensive - for £35 each we could have had a taxi all day or taken a couple of ordinary buses to Belem etc for under £10. Or the metro. So I feel a bit of a mug having done this, to be honest.
Finally, there seem to be two competitors, with almost identical red buses, fonts, coloured lines, but different numbering of stops. Which one's better? Who knows??",2
Avoid getting off the bus,"We took the bus to go around Lisbon, we could get off the bus and pick it up afterwards except the trap is when we wanted to get back on the bus there was no room.
We waited more than 1 hour and all buses were full. So we took an uber to the stop after ""S. George's Castle"", then a bus arrived but still no room on the bus and the driver announces that it is the last bus so we have to get back to the hotel by our own means.
Good adventurers that we are, we finished running and on the rain.
Knowing that we paid 33 € for a tour that we did not complete we were more than disappointed (even if they are tickets for 24 hours).
Despite this we went back to try to make the ticket profitable.
Be careful at the stops because you may not be able to get back on the bus.
Otherwise Lisbon is a beautiful city.",2
Not worth it - poorly run,"Very disappointing. Very little information provided through the on-board audio, not timed to the location, with no reference to where the building is. Busses were infrequent, crowded. Blue loop is a waste of time - too far out and no sites. Paper map is not detailed enough to find stops, online map is not downloadable. Ended up using screen shots. Even on site map with detail the stops are not exactly where they show. Night tour didn’t pause anywhere with city light views. Walking tour was OK, but again, finding the exact location of the start took forever because of poor paper map. Tour guide was at the stop but didn’t immediately identify herself. Boat tour is difficult to find and not explained well in the ticket/email/website. Stops are again not clearly shown on any map. (We ended up skipping it but heard it was good).",2
Horrible,"Horrible!!!!! Misinformation and lies from the salesperson Misdirections to the pickup point. Waited almost 2 hours for a bus after finding out there were other bus companies that did not accept our tickets
Because of wait for bus, arrived at transfer point after other line shut down for day. Required to taxi back to starting point.
Narration was awful, no useful info was given. Just an awful experience. Ruined our day in Lisbon. Stay far away from this ripoff. I will be contacting the company to demand a refund and reimbursement for taxi fare",1
Terrible - do not bother,"This was so terrible. Audio didn't work properly, stop signs were marked with the wrong numbers, complete waste of £33.

I have used hop on hop off buses all over the world, and this company was the absolute worst experience.",1
Not a good experience,"(April, 27 and 28, 2025)
Family of four with tickets for 48h here!

We started with the green line to go up and visit the Castle and it was ok so we decided to take the blue line after lunch and let the red one for the next day.

The blue line is a nightmare. Almost two hours into the modern neighborhoods and suburbs of Lisbon (which are clean and safe and ok if you’re looking for a mall but it’s not something we would have paid that much to see)!

Last but not least: the red line is ok if you’re going to take the boat. Otherwise, you will spend a lot time seeing neighborhoods and then in a highway. The points of interest in the Belém area you’ll see from a far!

Sad note: the sales were very friendly but we asked a driver for some info regarding the departures (we were waiting in their parking area for the red line) and he answered in a very blunt way.

I’d NOT recommend.",1
Don’t waste your money,"This was the worst City Sightseeing Hop-On Hop-Off experience we’ve ever had. We chose the line that goes to the Aquarium (I don’t recall the line color) because it went through a part of town we had not seen. The audio didn’t work and the driver didn’t point anything out. So, we got off before the long drive to the Aquarium, walked to a different station and tried a second line color (city center area). The audio was scratchy, didn’t match with the landmarks and then it quit. When I pointed it out to the driver, he told me “it’s fine”. The audio eventually restarted, but wasn’t any better so we got off this bus for after five stops . We decided the 3rd color line (the one to Belem) would be another waste of our time, so we didn’t attempt it.

The other red hop-on hop-off bus is run by Grayline and might be better. Or, try the yellow bus.",1
Stay out of the blue,"Got off the cruise ship and was told only the blue route was available at our stop so on we got. 90 minutes of my life I won't get back later, after going through a dystopian nuclear fallout zone of the capital ending up at the aquarium we didn't want to see, we finally ended up in central Lisbon. It was then the rain came! 90 mins of sunshine while on the bottom back of the open top bus and rain when we finally get off! Stay out of the blue and in the red or green is the new Tiedos Rogeros line for cruise passengers wondering which way to turn.",1
Not Worth The Money,"As we had so much rain during our stay we thought we’d use one of the sightseeing bus, sadly we chose the wrong sightseeing tour
We paid €34 per person which was a complete waste of money and a rip off
Staff were unfriendly and not very helpful the commentary on the bus was dreadful most of the time it played terribly music
We only did 2 of the tours the green route which was ok but the bus time table wasn’t regular with bus’s turning up every 25 to 45 minutes
We also did the blue route and was taken on a lovely drive through the housing estates of Lisbon and then the stop we wanted to get off at was closed but the driver didn’t let us know, really not helpful
My view is Lisbon isn’t big enough for this type of sightseeing tours and is a waste of money, be warned",1
Don’t waste your money.,"Don’t waste your money. Pick a different Hop on Hop off. Drove around, didn’t know what we were looking at. No narration. Had to look at map to even figure out where we were if we could. Waste of time and money. Ridiculous.",1
Don’t book this!,So very disappointed in this tour. Timings for buses all over the place. Hardly any narrative at all and quite often repeated. Do not spend your money on this !,1
Skip this company not worth the money,"Old broken seats, headsets don't work, very uncomfortable, terrible drivers, rude and information given incorrect, I would not recommend this company go with Greyline we found that company really well ran. Also, getting a refund back from this company was non-existent when I cancelled outside the 48-hour time frame",1
Blue line is very disappointing.,"Red line is fine. Blue line has little to offer. During the entire ride you will not get any explanation or comment, which is the intention with sightseeing.
Could be much better.",2
Disaster,An absolute naughtiness!! Waiting times of up to almost an hour!! Never again!! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone...,1
"not recommended, try alternatives","We have been using Hop on hop off buses in all European cities. Always loving them and having the best experiences as you use them to move around but also to learn something....This one needs for sure improvements: the audio guide is practically not a guide. You just listen to music and the description is so poor, just a few minutes in an hour ride , also not at all synchronized. Many audio guides didn't work on the buses, and we needed to change seats to find the ones working propely. If the bus would be full, we might ended up with no guide at all... We have 2 free walking tours with our ticket. we only did the ""from castle to Alfama"" tour. Absolutely lost of time. We expected to discover Alfama. We did not. The tour guide seemed really bored, not liking her job... we have done free tours in other cities which were so nice. we have just passed from the Cathedral, and just walk down the hill reaching the beachfront road towards the main square (not Alfama). The only things we did see at Alfama and the tour guide had described were the Miradouro (view point) ,one strange tree, and one building. We took a walk by ourselves (not at all organized as we have thought that the tour will cover most of the area... ) and our walk was much better, we discovered Alfama indeed ,which is an amazing place...!! Overall we have paid for 48h ticket with 3 routes and 2 walking tours and 1 night tour. We ended up using it only for 1 day, 1 route, and 1 walking tour. We didn't want to use the service for any other routes or tour, as it was a lost of our time and money basically. Public buses are on time (you can buy the ticket from the driver) .Also, Bolt (instead of uber) is a very cheap and convenient way to use to go anywhere in Lisbon, and Free walking tours using Guru Walk is a great way to explore the city.",2
Fantastic if your idea of a fun day out is standing at bus stops,"Whilst the 3 routes offered do what they say on the side of the bus and provide sightseeing tours, the 'hop on hop off' bit is rather negatively impacted by not knowing when the next bus might come along. Trying to work out where the stops are proved frustrating and time consuming too. The only way to do the latter is, it seems, to get a leaflet which has a basic, not to scale, map showing approximate locations... and the only place we could find a leaflet was actually on the bus! As for bus times, we gave up and relied on hope and St Christopher.

The amount of time we spent waiting for buses to turn up impacted negatively on the amount of things we had time to do and see. In total we got on and off 7 times in 2 days, and spent around 3 hours waiting for buses.

What was more upsetting though was on our first day (we were in town for 3 days total) I spent a gnats under £60 for 2x48hr passes, booked online on the official website. These passes compulsorily included an unwanted night tour that we couldn't get to, as it started on the opposite side of Lisbon to our accommodation, and 2 walking tours (didn't want those either, have you seen the hills in Lisbon?) . Because we could only get 2 day passes we spent the rest of our first day doing very little. It was only on day 2, when, having eventuality found a bus stop and a city-sightseeing bus, did we discover that due to a company policy change our 48 hr passes were in fact 72 hr passes. Shame that wasn't mentioned on the website, we could have used them in our first day too and maybe got to see a few more of the places we missed...

Rant over! But really, if you do book these tours (which I absolutely don't recommend) be prepared to do a lot of waiting around and ideally do your homework first and find out where the nearest bus stop is!",2
Do not use them and if you do do not lose your ticket or they will scream at you,I accidentally threw away my paper ticket and the bus driver screamed at me and made me cry and refused to let me on the bus. It was awful.,1
Worst city tour anywhere,Absolutely awful don't bother worst tour I have ever been on commentary was a joke so we're the parts of the city we went through. Driving along motorway looking at high rise blocks or by the harbour seeing derelict buildings pile of rubbish and rows of tents where the homeless live! Not a great experience of Lisbon not a good word to say about the whole trip waste of money,1
Awful,"I wish I had read the reviews before booking this. It really is awful. We’ve done many of these tours in other cities and they’ve been great. This however was sitting on a bus in traffic with pretty much zero commentary. They don’t even announce the different stops along the way. They literally tell you about 3 things on the whole tour. We went in January, so off season and were constantly sat in heavy traffic, so it must be even worse in the summer. The green line was like an endurance test, we both felt sick so had to get off! A real waste of money. If you want to learn about Lisbon this is not the way to do it. We saw many people on tuk tuks, with live commentary by animated local guides, we should have done that instead.",1
If all you want is a ride around town..,"Essentially no narration or did not correspond to the location

Christmas music (Jan 12) in place of narration

Filthy bus

Nice ride outside is all is has going for it",2
Worst City Sightseeing Bus Experience,"My husband and I have taken many Hop on Hop off including City Sigtseeing company and have been very satisfied with the service, but this one from Lisbon Portugal was AWFUL!.
They gave us an explanation when selling it that had nothing to do with what they do.
We had a mid-morning Tour and we thought we would take it to get to know the City and get to the point of our meeting for the Tour and ended up getting off the Bus and running to find a Taxi that would take us to the desired point because the tour was not in the time explained and also throughout the journey they only played music and did not give ANY explanation of the City or the places we passed.
Luckily when we arrived at the Tour in the City it was formidable (Free walking tour) and we got to know and learn a lot about Lisbon.
My recommendation is :Do not take this City Sightseeing in Lisbon Portugal.You will waste your money and spend your time.It is a real disrespect for those who want to know this beautiful City.",1
Don't,"We should have listened to the reviews. We have used the company before and enjoyed it. We waited 40 minutes at a stop with no sign. I chatted with the help desk who sent us a Google maps pin. We waited. We called the London office. The bus was coming in a further 45 minutes. A full 90 minutes after the advertised starting time. Absolutely no help, terrible service.",1
Disappointed in city sightseeing bus tour.,Disappointing city sightseeing bus tour. Been on these across the world and always try to use the same company. But some of the buses in Lisbon don’t have any decent narration and some of them the earphone connections don’t even work .,2
Hilariously bad. Don’t do it.,"This was so bad. We ended up jumping off the blue line after 40 minutes. We did this as we had spent the time listening to Christmas songs, getting no guided tour insight and driving along a motorway.

Genuinely think there was 5 “guided tour insights” made in the 40 minutes- we were laughing so hard as it’s so bad; it was comical.

General vibe was like “here is the military museum: lots of military items in there”. And that was it!!!
It’s like one of the main tourist sites in the city and you reduce it to that. Then they ramp up the Christmas songs to fill the void.

Also you have no clue where you are in the city. So you end up on some weird public bus trip listening to some rubbish music.

A complete shambles and waste of money. Don’t do it. Lots of great small tours, personal guides. Use them.",1
Worst experience ever … waste of money / take UBER,"The worst experience ever, we were announced in the morning that the service is interrupted from noon to 3 PM on red line .. and the time schedule has not bee respected at all. Basically, you should go for other companies like Yellow Bus or Lisbon Sightseeing which is much more regular.",1
Don’t waste your money with this one,"Just don’t, trust the reviews. The worst hop on hop off in the world. Zero information, you are just riding around. Languages are not available like it says on the bus. No value for money",1
city-sightseeing to avoid,"Hello,

We took a tourist bus for the first time to visit Lisbon. The bus driver was on the phone for most of the blue circuit. She did not activate the comments at the right time when it was necessary.

For the red line, we did not have the end of comments. When we tried to take the red line, we waited for more than an hour. When the bus arrived, there were two buses. The late bus wouldn't pick us up and then it wanted to race with our bus..",1
Poor and unprofessional trip,"Very little audio for a city with so much history and architecture, did not go on a sightseeing tour to listen to Christmas music , no reference to different buildings , size of streets , paving, statues of different people of importance , very little mention of the earthquake that devastated the city , need to go to Bath in UK and listen to audio there",2
Poor experience & very poor value for money.,"City Sightseeing Tours is a very poor service. The commentary provided is very limited often inaccurate & out of date. The route makes a number of loops that are very time consuming & unnecessary. The service seems more interested in delivering passengers back to the cruiser ships than providing a genuine tour of the city.

I also believe that it is very for value for money. The three routes are barely possible to undertake in one one day without time to “hop on & hop off” & further view points of interest.

Also on the day of the tour - there had been a few issues resulting in all three of the trips being curtailed, doubling back on part of the routes. No mention was made of this before purchasing the tickets - yet the drivers were clearly aware. All in all a very poor experience.",1
Just DON'T with City Sightseeing,"Just DON'T.
City Sightseeing is the worst and the most disorganised sightseeing company I have ever seen.
Waiting forever for the buses, large parts of the itineraries cut off with all sorts of excuses.
Impossible to do their 3 routes in one day and yet they sell you the tickets as if that was feasible.
Headphone sockets not working, guides out of sync to where we were, outdated information given.
Just don't choose this operator. You may also regret it.",1
"Expensive, fact-lite and slow way to travel",There was hardly any commentary at all which was the reason we used it. We were on it for about an hour and heard maybe 4 facts. Loads of the ear phone points were broken so it limited where you could sit. We waited a very long time for the bus to arrive.,1
"Avoid this company - read the reviews, don’t waste your money.","Purchased 2x 24hr single red line tickets at Restauradores, stop 2, Lisbon. Was not advised better option for 48 hours and 2 lines was only 4 Euro more.

No space upstairs, very poor visibility downstairs.

Eventually took up some seats upstairs when occupants left, however audio guide system did not work, so no information. Complete waste of time and money, use the tube, tram, bus, quicker and far cheaper, wish I had read the reviews before.

Have contacted customer service, but no refund offered, I will not be using this company again.",1
Such a terrible service,"This is just a terrible service from waiting over an hour for a bus to drivers driving past us when we were waiting at a correct stop to a bus never showing up at all at one of the hop on stops. Please do yourself a favour and don’t go with these guys, yellow bus much better!",1
Horrible this scam,"Traveling regularly in capitals I often took the sightseeing sightseeing sightseeing sightseeing bus. I had never been disappointed so we took the tickets without being suspicious .. and without reading the reviews. What a monumental mistake!! We looked for the wrong stops and when we found them we waited 30 to 40 minutes .. we saw the buses of the other 2 companies pass 2 to 3 times. We climbed to the Castle San Jorge on foot and wanted to take the green bus in front to get back down. 2 passed in front of us complete.. we had to leave on foot after an hour wait.
And today we wanted to make the cruise that we had paid in the 47 euros.. it was mentioned every hour from 10:45 to 17:45.. arriving at the pontoon at 14:30 after having eaten with stone lance to be on time we learn that the only one to come is in 1 hour... no one had informed us while we had asked the driver that same morning..
I strongly advise against this company on the city of Lisbon!! To flee!!",1
Worst hop on hop off bus I've done,"Worse bus tour I've ever gotten (my best one was in Vienna)

I wish I had checked the reviews before purchasing this one.

- you cannot see the bus positions on the map, so you end up waiting a lot, especially because they're often late
- the audio tour is very poor and in many occasions they're triggered in the wrong place
- the blue line goes through several places that are not interesting, which could be a better experience with more audio
- there were stops without marks, like blue 4
- there were stops in the wrong position in the map, like red 12
- the walking tour guide was not very good, although very kind

I don't know how the other ones are, but I strongly suggest you do your research before choosing this one.

Also, I can see they responded reviews here saying the strive to improve, but in my exclusive there's still much room for improvement compared to other buses experiences.",1
VERY BAD,"BAD SERVICE. I would not recommend it to anyone there are other companies that do the same service and are very good.
Long waits (three buses of the other company before ours arrived).
It started to rain a lot we asked to close the bus and said no... you can see that it is the company's disposition. we got off just in time and watching the buses go by while it rained hard and only the city sightseeing buses were open and all the people were very wet ..
I assure you that the minibuses could be closed automatically.
I strongly advise against the company.
With earphones you listen to a lot of muzzles and little history, they do not warn about subsequent stops.
Money thrown away",1
Waste of Money,"Total rip off. Completely disorganized. Unfriendly staff. Barely got any descriptions of anything on the route, mostly just played horrible music. I gave up listening after a while.

DONT DO IT !!,"Terrible experience. Ok, so the driver drove way too fast. The driver did not stop at most of the stops. The buses are old and very noisy. Bought tickets near stop 7 on the green line and buses drove right past. We walked to stop 12 which is not far away to caught it and hoping it stopped for us there, which it did. On this day it was overcast, and the roof was closed. Asked the driver to open it but he said he doesnt have a key for it. Ride was fast and stuffy. Complained to staff when we got off and she told us to contact head office which i did with no reply. Overall Very Unorganised. THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD... DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. JUST LOOK AT THE REVIEWS.",1
DO NOT HSE THIS COMPANY !,"Please do not waste your money on this bus tour. We were waiting up-to 2 hours at a time for busses to turn up and none arrived. We were waiting by the aquarium as bus stop 9 on the blue route in the pouring rain and the two other bus tour services had multiple busses pass and none from this company.

The yellow bus company seemed a lot more organised and were a lot more frequent.

We paid for the 48 hour ticket and really wish we didn’t waste our money on this. We resulted to walking a lot of places or even using a taxi service as the bus service was so poor and we didn’t want to waste time waiting for a bus to not turn up.

I have raised a complaint with customer service and they are useless and offer no help or compensation for the appalling service offered.",1
Fatal experience,"At the Marquis de Pombal stop, the driver bus changed and it was a real disaster. The whole journey of accelerations and sharp turns until, getting off the stop Palacio Nacional de Ajuda, we had a small accident, we noticed a strong blow in the front wheel of the driver, hitting us against the front seat and a few meters, in the middle of the street had to stop for breakdown and come another bus to pick us up as it was full. You'd expect from the way you drove. Besides the bus took more people than seats there were, they were standing in the hallway and staircase, so it was good that nothing else happened.",1
The worst red bus I have ever been on,Do not book with this company. The buses are irregular (over 1 hour 15 min wait at the bus stop). From the terminus at Marques de Pombal the green bus was full (we were on it) and it sat not moving for 40 minutes. You cannot get around anywhere in the city using these buses they are useless. We had a 48 hour ticket but reverted to metro on the second day due the appalling service. Do not waste your money. The yellow bus company appeared to have many more buses and more frequent - use them not this terrible terrible terrible company that ruined a day of our holiday. City sightseeing you should be ashamed of this service.,1
Bus Problems,"I report that I had a recent bad experience (together with my family) at City Sightseeing Lisbon / Lisbon in September 2024; I explain myself, the bad experience was mainly in the following areas:
1- We had waiting time, while trucks of other companies (example BigBus) passed almost every 20 min, Including their similar of the green route, instead, with the trucks of City Sightseeing we had to wait more than 50 minutes between trucks for both routes of, on the green route had more than an hour, this greatly affected our visits that we had scheduled forcing us to reduce their time between each other
2- There was very little variety of information that they said in the audiotur, it was very scarce, they reported almost nothing, they repeated several times in several places the same data and it was not referring to the point that was passing the bus at the moment and they almost do not report the important things when the Bus passes close or are in sight and the few that he mentions did not even say which side they were referring to the bus
3- Also the music they put in the background audio became annoying, I know that the Fados is part of the culture of Portugal, but they have it on is very melancholy and it kept repeating itself.
4- They don’t report when the stop was coming, I had to be with the map / application at hand and checking every second to know when it is about to reach a stop, nor do they inform you what is relevant to visit at that stop, outside of what you can check on the page and in the application.
5- In the Lisbon app, it DOES NOT SHOW the location of the trucks in real time, just put the estimated stopping schedule.
6- Also sometimes, especially at the end of the day, they drove too fast to meet the schedule and that does not allow you to appreciate what you see on the road
I report that because of this bad experience in our first days of our vacation, they affected the decision on the NO use of City Sightseeing buses in the following cities we visited (London / Madrid)",2
Flee poor Lisbon who does not deserve this,We travel very often this morning it was lame 👎 the circuit blue and red uninteresting .. the audiophones of very poor quality .. it sizzled unbearable .. more than half an hour waiting between two lines .. it is the first time we notice all these inconveniences .. sincerely to flee,1
AVOID AVOID AVOID,"I'll start by saying this company doesn't even deserve the one star and apologies for this long review. I hope no one else gets scammed by this company.

Myself and my partner were in Lisbon for 4 days at the end of September and chose to book a hop-on hop-off tour for Thursday 26th September. We had a plan for our day which included going to the Aquarium. We arrived at the beginning of the line, at Marques De Pombal, and planned on getting the blue line (since this went up to the Aquarium). We arrived here at 11:20am just as one of the blue line buses pulled away. We asked the ground operator when the next bus would be and he said 12:00. As this wouldn't be a long wait, we just hung around, not leaving the area. During this time there were 3 or 4 green and red line buses arriving and departing with passengers. At 12:15 there was still no sign of the blue line bus. The ground operator was dismissive when questions, stating the bus was late and didn't know when it would arrive. 12:30 the bus arrives.

As we booked our tickets (X2 adult tickets for €64) online, the driver was evidently annoyed that we did this because he had to use his electronic handheld device. Eventually this was sorted and off we went. The commentary was atrocious and out of sync. Waste of time. Half way through the trip, heading towards the Aquarium, the bus pulled over and the driver instructed all passengers to get off and board the bus that was behind us. Zero explanation given. On the 2nd bus, the driver was on his own personal mobile phone, having a very loud phone conversation. No way we could hear any of the commentary. We got off at the Aquarium.

After our visit, we went to the City Sightseeing spot near Gare do Oriente. We just missed a blue line bus and waited for over an hour for a bus and eventually had to give up and get the metro back to our accommodation.

This whole experience was extremely disappointing and ruined our day. It put such a dampener on our short trip to Lisbon. We have been in touch with customer service looking for a refund, but they said ""there was nothing they could do"" and could only offer us a 20% refund (€12.80!!!). The dispute with the company is still continuing, 14 days later.",1
3 hour Nightmare,"Arrived Cruise Terminal September 12th ,having used them before our group chose City Sightseeing Red Bus. For first 25 minutes into tour everybody trying to connect earphones to commentary with no success, only staff member was driver and he was naturally busy driving .Eventually commentary began.The journey was up and down the busy city streets, minimal commentary, very little to inspire the tourist until we finally moved onto Rio Tejo riverside road.I have no idea what route we were on , a combination of red/blue route according to map and I guess we only got commentary for the part of the route the bus was programmed for. After 2.5 hours driver came upstairs and informed us in broken english(as we were all off the cruise boat and English/ American nationals) that he was taking us back to Cruise Terminal.We arrived back almost 3 hours after our 12:43 start , overexposed to the sun and desperate for the toilet, certainly in no mood to have a chat with the sole City Sightseeing staff at Terminal. The tour was a complete waste of money, Lisbon is properly an interesting city but we did not see it on this tour, very disappointing.",2
Just don't,"Just don't. It ruined our day. First we waited 40 minutes and were then taken just one stop where the driver had a break for 15 minutes. Then the tour continued. The recorded commentary was very poor, uninformative and out of sequence. After about 20 minutes we 'hopped off' for the first and only time. After looking around, we found ourselves stranded at the top of a hill waiting for 90 minutes while the buses of other companies passed one after the other (we were not alone). No information online as to why this happened. Tried to contact the company by phone - one number went unanswered, another was unobtainable. No email address. Tried speaking to agents at two ticket kiosks and got given the runaround.",1
"A classic tourist trap, take a Tuc Tuc instead and get the personal service.","If you want to spend your time and money on standing in queue and countless bus stops with several minutes waiting time almost each stop, go ahead. We experienced bad service on our trip as well. We got a print out ticket from our first driver. Without any further comment from the driver, we regarded this piece of paper as any other receipt (we got the booking confirmation by mail). When trying switching buses layer the same day, we suddenly got asked for this piece of paper. Without that, it wasn’t possible to continue our trip. There was no way to reprint the ticket our show the digital evidence of paying our 24-hours tickets. You make up your own mind - I don’t think it’s good customer service in 2024.",1
bad experience,"We had a tour on the red line of CitySightseeing Lisboa in September.
The bus was old. We sat at the bottom, because too hot to seat in the sun on the top.
There was no ventilation in the bus. No windows at the back part! And no aircon!!
Apart from that, the sound system was not understandable!
Why the review is poor and not terrible? Because we also took the green line, and the conditions were better.",2
Why do City sighseeing allow this dreadful organisation to continue ?,"Avoud at all costs , fond someone else Truly DIRE , Every other city sighseeing trip arounf Europe have been great but this one?
We were picked up at the port and went on our way , bit concerned it was different to the map but we thought maybe roadwrks (NO, there weren't) the commentary dreadful as it was nearly just Fado music - the trip took around 4 or 5 hours , spent ages at bus stops and we didn't see any sights , just the outskirts of the city - loads of office blocks and apartments . Eventually the driver took us to a car park and went off , a guide came o ask us whywe were on the bus - its a circular trip and we need to get back to the ship , she did her best and got the driver back whod gone for a snack and a cigarette and eventually he took us back via the outskirts of the city - got the impression he was laughing ! My partner who has a bad back suffered and did very little for the next two stops of our cruise",1
Waste of money,"Waste of money. Was charged 32 euros against advertised price of 27 euros. Waited an hour at stop 5 for a green line bus only to be told bus was full and we should only get on this at stop 1. 2 alternative operator buses passed in time we waited. Told to walk to alternative stop 30 minutes away. Buses not as frequent as advertised, poor signage for blue line around cruise area and last buses all at 5 pm and limited commentary. In 6 hours only managed to complete part of red and blue lines and 2 stops on green line without any opportunity for sightseeing. You’d be better off walking and using metro and trams to get around the city.",1
Bad experience,"We stayed more than half an hour waiting for a bus on blue line 12, the bus did not stop because another bus came behind and the other bus was from another company. There are very few buses from this company, which makes you not give to complete all routes, unless you spend the whole day on the bus. I do not recommend, money put out.",1
Shocking commentary. Give this tour a miss.,"Give this your company a miss.

This could have been very informative but the commentary was terrible. 90% of the commentary was crap music. There was no explanation about the city, people, history or anything. We went past so many interesting buildings and parks with no explanation.",1
Don't do it!,"Hardly any buses and no way to find out, even one star is far too many. If you want to save time and nerves, book the Grey Line!",1
Extremely disappointing,"My husband and I paid 64 euros for a day pass on the city sightseeing Hop on - Hop off bus. What a disaster. We were taken to bus stop 5 by the representative and waited for a bus. We wanted to try the green route first but only a small bus so no chance of getting on one. We couldn't get on the first red route bus and had to wait another 40 minutes for the next one. There were just a few seats but we managed to get on the back of the bus. There was only one plug in point to hear the information so only one of us could plug in. We heard music then it went off so no information was heard . We stayed on the bus to go round as if we got off we wouldn't have got back on again. We tried to get on another route but buses were always full. The agents were not interested. I asked for a refund but no chance of that. We finished up paying for a boat trip on the front which was lovely for half the price. We cannot recommend the bus at all, expensive less than 2 hours sat on a bus looking at buildings and not knowing anything about them as no information to be heard.",1
Absolutely no Recommendation !,"We had to wait a total of 45 minutes at one station. During this time, two buses of the other line passed by, in which there were still enough seats. When our bus finally arrived, it was of course completely full. During the journey, terrible music plays and only at the stops is something briefly said. From other bus trips I know this differently, that you are also informed during the trip.",1
Don’t Even Consider This Tour,"Do not do this tour. Their service is not only spotty but if you hop off and expect to hop on another bus anytime soon expect to wait hours. The green bus to the castle is small due to the small streets it has to navigate but there need to be many more of them. I was sitting right behind our driver who while driving watched a video on her phone, ate and had a phone conversation the entire trip. Talk about distracted driving! This company is disorganized from top to bottom. I think we hopped off a total of 3 times from 2 buses due to the long wait in between. If we hopped off more would probably still be waiting by a sign in Lisbon.
Save your money, walk and take cabs or uber.",2
No!,"To escape. Very few buses with totally random schedules. At the same stops, another company. Two buses from the other company pass... 50 min wait... (red line, the one we expected) the few comments are uninteresting, but fado with rotten sound floods your ears. End of shift at 17.30. Conclusion, a journey from the ferry station to Belem Cathedral for 34€. No more buses back 17.15 at the stop. Return by bus 15E. Take the tram!",1
Lisbon City Sightseeing Misery,"City Sightseeing Lisbon Red line
This tour was one of our worst experiences. We (4) purchased the Essential tour. Our first experience was to go to Belém Tower. The driver had difficulty with the ticket purchase but sorted it out after showing him a picture from the website. At the end of our trip we waited an hour and a half for the next bus. Everyone on the bus was furious. The poor driver got an earful from many customers. We decided to Uber as the wait wasn't worth it.",1
Disappointing,This is the worst sightseeing experience I have ever had on a sightseeing bus. A short audio is very lacking. Disappointed with experience and a waste of my time and money.,1
The worst city sightseeing we've been on,"We always tend to use the red bus City Sightseeing hop on and off when we visit new places. They tend to give you a great overview and orientation of the area. This one cost €35 each for 48 hours. We purchased the tickets at 11 a.m., and this meant on the 3rd day we were able to get on the bus nice and early to take us to the station for a trip to Cascais.
All I will say is this is a facility to get you around the sights. Nothing more. You're not given the headphones by the ticket seller, then you're left wondering where they are. They are in the front dash area of the buses. The commentary is very sparse with little information about where you are, what the next stop is, and what you are about to come to. When there is commentary its out of sync with the places of interest, by that, I mean you've missed them as you've already gone by them. Make sure you're looking out for the stops the bus doesn't hang around if you're dithering as to whether to get off or not.
The green route is the better route, but smaller bus due to the narrow roads, it tends to fill up at stop 1, so you've no chance getting on it before the castle stop. Blue line more for expo centre. Red line, for Belem.
I am sure there was more to learn about the place, it was quite disappointing from that point of view.",1
Red route tour wasted 3 hrs,Total waste of 3 hrs . No information earphone didn't work on bus. Spent 3hrs doing circular of 26 miles around shops and few monuments not knowing what they where,1
Not so great tour,"We took city sightseeing tour in Porto and Lisbon and the experience was not there.
Company staff gave us bad directions. Long wait at bus stop sometime one hour. The company has no App for bus tracking.
I don’t recommend City sightseeing tour company. You should book with Grayline tour or Yellow Bus. There are more convenient.",1
Truly shocking. They need massive improvements,I’m only sorry I didn’t read reviews 1st the tour of all 3 lines is truly shockingly bad. If I could give no star I would. The audio only explained a few sites and had to listen so rubbish music in between. We’ve used this company in other cities and had been very impressed but they need to massively up their audio here. Lisbon has so much to talk about but only heard but the earthquake in 1755 about 10 times and the fires in 1988. Seriously fix this guys!!,1
Probably the worst of all!,"Awful! Green line: very few words spoken by the audio system, uninteresting as well. The driver was driving too fast to enjoy anything. Red line: audio was better but the driver scratched the front bumper of a car parked. We stayed on site for 30 minutes not knowing what was going on until I went down and saw the driver signing accident report! No communication whatsoever. The worst!",2
"Terrible company to deal with - avoid, use a different city tour!","We purchased an online ticket when in Lisbon with our cruise in July. The company’s own website states buses are every 30 mins. We waited at our chosen stop in heat of 36 degrees for 40 mins and no bus came, until the kids couldn’t stick the heat anymore so we had to leave and got a taxi. The ticket wasn’t activated and the company has refused to give a refund despite them not meeting their own commitment regarding time between buses. A completely unreasonable, unreliable company! I even asked for a credit to use in another city (we were only is Lisbon that one day) and they’ve refused that too! Don’t give this company your money!",1
DISAPPOINTED in Lisbon,"Having gone on the Liverpool tour, we were excited to see this available on our day stop in Lisbon for our cruise. Didn’t even come close the meeting expectations.

We bought tickets in the cruise terminal. We were advised as to the two route options of Red or Blue. We decided Red was the right option for us and hopped on the bus. Fortunately we learned early from another passenger that the Red route only picked up at the cruise terminal…but that we would need the Blue route to get back to our starting point

While the flyer/map says English, only the major stop descriptions are in English.

The design is awful for trying to actually see the language number of the 13 options. The sound is mono … meaning it only generates into one earphone, not both. This is problematic when you have busy street sounds and people conversing.

Once we got going, the narrator was very limited. Since we didn’t start at the usual starting point we thought it would get better when we stop 1 … about 30 minutes later. Even then we only could tell it was stop 1 by the map.

Getting going the narrator picked up again. You except silence at stoplights and slow traffic. However most of the narratives were about 3 sentences. As we approached stops, there was nothing that clearly stated stop 2, 3, etc. Again had to figure it out from the map … in Portuguese.

Finally arriving at stop 6 nearly an hour after starting at stop 1 (not the cruise port, but the real stop 1) we got off. This was the closest to the cruise terminal. With 10 more stops to go plus needing to get onto the Blue line to get back to the port, we gave up. We didn’t expect to take 3 hours or more to make it one time around the route.

Very disappointing and a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!",1
Non sight seeing tours,This was a poor experience compared to similar tours in other cities . The commentary on the headset provided was scant and the brochure was in Portugese with very few tips or descriptions on what would be good to see . We did the red line bus which had 20 on/off stops most of which were not near any decent attractions . Nobody got off at the first 10 stops and nobody got on which indicated how poor the attractions where . Some of the attractions were closed on Monday but the driver didn't know if they were open or not . The only thing I discovered about Lisbon was that the hop on hop off buses are the worst tourist guides I have ever been on.,2
Avoid,"Avoid buying from cruise terminal.
You will be told that you have bought green (old town), red (new town) & Blue (surrounding area).
We were met at the bus stop and told to get Blue line first after an argument about the tickets went left, good grief you don’t want to see anything on the blue line it’s the rough side of town.
The bus was packed & forced downstairs with no air conditioning & most of the audio was dreadful music.
We arrived at the main meeting point number 1 after 45 painful mins.
We waited patiently being told different places to wait in the scorching sun & watched the chaos.
After 20 mins & letting the red line pass we got on the small single decker bus.
Only to be told our purchase didn’t include the green line.
We tried to explain we bought all 3 lines to be told it’s impossible to buy all 3 lines.
While trying to explain, the bus now full went without us.
I can understand €27 pp for the green & red lines (didn’t get to use) & then extra €3 for blue line if u really want to see the rough side.
We bought 8 x €27 = €216 if we were told €30 we would have paid it.
There were other places selling all 3 lines.
The town is easily accessible by foot from the cruise terminal & heard good things from passengers using the electric tuk tuk.
If u really have to use this service just walk into town & get on at any green line stops for €3.",1
Poor narration,Very little narration and they don’t announce the stops. If you aren’t on the right side of the bus to see the bus stop signs you don’t know where you are,2
Avoid City Sightseeing in Lisbon,"Crappy. They just drove around the city for 2 hours with nearly no narration, what narration there was, was difficult to understand; there was no announcement of stops or what could be accessed at each stop. No clear method to get back to the cruise port. Find a different company.",1
I would give it a ZERO,This was the worst hop on hop off bus I have ever been on. the audio was not in sync with what I was seeing and the audio was not informative. Big waste of time. I was able to use my tickets that day and the next but only did the one leg and would not get on again. The company was less than understanding. VERY DISAPPOINTED,1
Crappy tour - no information,This was a waster of money-might as well have been on a city bus. Most of the tour was just music with no explanation of what we were seeing or any history. I would not recommend this tour to anyone!,1
Much longer route than advertised - check the route timings!,"6 of us went on the Red Route tour from the Cruise Terminal, 27 euros each. It started off well, but the commentary was average and 80% was music being played. The person who sold us the tickets at the cruise terminal told us the Red Route was 90 minutes. 3 hours later, and feeling fried in the heat, we made it back to the terminal. Check that your bus returns to the cruise terminal as we were suddenly told to change buses part way through the route.",2
Mai più!,"We disembarked from the cruise ship and, having little time available, we chose this service. A decidedly wrong choice! When we made the tickets we were assured that the full tour would last about two hours. We went up at 8.30 and after two hours we arrived at the Belém tower... of course from there we had to return...another hour and a half! Many headphone connections did not work, ours for example... we changed seats twice to find one that worked, but the volume was very low, with traffic you could hear very little! Also not always the information given corresponded to what you saw... probably the service works for other cities, for Lisbon just not!",1
Disappointed,"I had high hopes for the tour. My goal was to learn about the city before deciding what to see later in person. I travelled both lines in one day: blue and red.
Two of my biggest complaints are:
1. No air conditioning on the lower level. On a hot sunny Portuguese day the choice was to bake in the sun on the upper deck or broil in the shade of the lower deck. None of them too pleasant
2. The audio commentary was very, very scarce. Each line was about 90-120 minutes long but the total audio time was maybe 5-10 minutes. The information was very basic and repetitive. The rest of the time, the system played fado music. Although beautiful, it gets old when you hear the same songs couple of times over.

Improve the guide, install some AC or at least fans and the score will go up!",2
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH EXPERIENCE. RIPPED OFF AGAIN!,"What a shocking experience.DO NOT USE. €60 wasted poor information passing lots of historical building with nothing on the audio guide but they do tell you about the biggest department store in Lisbon. The map is very difficult to follow, you’d think by now such a global company would have an app as guidance!
You’d be better off jumping in a tuk tuk or using a local guide as the red buses are rubbish. Had a similar experience in San Sebastián last year and vowed not to use again but got sucked in by a the clever sales person. I’VE BEEN ROBBED NEVER AGAIN!",1
Don’t book any City Sightseeing tours - dismal “commentary” and awful music,"This was awful. Commentary was sloppy, and the same information was told on all three routes. Dont do this tour - the lady with the long ponytail at the Marque roundabout at the beginning of the tour was fantastic and informative. The commentaries on all three buses were dismal. And they played dreadful music constantly. It was awful. So many lovely buildings, parks, etc with such an opportunity to inform. Awful awful awful",1
Rubbish,"Got tickets for the blue & red lines. Caught the blue line at starting point. Couple of staff hovering around clearly left their brain at home that day. Eventually got on journey, driver was riding other cars/bikes back sides, so dangerous. Blue route dull and like going through the bronx/interstate highway. Got red route later in day, slightly better and more scenic. Staff were of very poor quality.",1
Bloody lip + Bad Service,"My Mom got a bloody lip after an emergency break because the driver didnt See the Red Light.

We didnt got the headphones. Only after we requested them and then our Tour was already half done.
Such a bad Service for 81 euros (3 adults) . Stay away",1
Avoid - they’ll waste your day,"You’ll spend more time waiting for the bus than actually on the tour. The website says 30 minutes between buses but I waiting over an hour for each bus, consistently. Terrible experience, you’ll waste your entire day and the staff are extremely rude",1
Use a different travel company,"Waited at the bus stop for an hour (busses supposed to come every 30 minutes). No busses ever came - well four busses passed from other travel companies but zero from City Sightseeing. Wasted an hour of our day and ended up Ubering the rest of the day. When I contacted the company for a refund they said no, I had to have requested the refund more than 24 hours prior to the day of use - as if I knew ahead of time that their company sucked and wouldn’t have any busses running on time. Use a different company if you intend to do a sightseeing bus. There are multiple options and City Sightseeing is the worst one.",1
City sightseeing disaster of a company,We used city sightseeing buses in many cities we have visited but lisbons version was very poor. We booked the 24 hour pass and got on the red line at belem and stayed on until we reached stop number one as we wanted to change to the blue line. This is where it all went very wrong. The blue line bus didn’t show up for 70 minutes and at this stage the line was long . There where staff from city sightseeing there but when they saw how frustrated people where getting they quickly distanced themselves from the ever growing line. The main frustration seemed to be with people who where using the bus to get back to their cruise ships. The blue route bus finally arrived and we managed to get on. We had planned on getting off at the aquarium but it was now 3pm and the last bus was at 6pm so we didn’t feel we had enough time to get off and get back on due to the unpredictability of the buses. So we stayed on the bus and did the whole of the blue loop which was one of the worst routes we where ever on. Absolutely nothing to see of any interest mainly down through the industrial area of lisbon then up to the aquarium and back down some main roads. The commentary was non existent due to it being a prerecorded version you listen to on individual earphones. The buses are severely underpowered to deal with the lisbon hills slowing to a crawl on some inclines . It took approximately 2 hours to do 3/4 of the blue loop as we got off at the first stop back in the city and used a bolt to get the rest of the way. Terrible experience with city sightseeing and would be hesitant to use them again in any city. We used Grayline the next day to do the green / castle route which we found much better service from. Agin the commentary was useless but the have a live app you can see when the next bus is arriving which was good,2
Diabolical and shambolic service,"A complete waste of money. Buses infrequent., rude and bad drivers, used car sales people. Just not worth the hassle, time and money . Don’t do it!!

PS the headphone sockets don’t work in a lot of seats…",1
Don't do it!,"Absolute waste of €27. Virtual tour guide (where you plug in earphones to hear what you're seeing) did not work. We tried several adaptors. It took 3 hours to get half way round the red route. We chose to abort for fear of missing our ships sailing. 4 of us paid for this. Total waste of time & money!

Constantly sat in traffic. I'd score minus if l could",1
Waste our money,"The worst experience we had in Lisbon. Without any information, because quite simply no one spoke English. We were told that for 27 euros per person we could use the red line one day and the blue line the next. The next day 09/11 the bus with the blue line never passed, and neither did the following 10/11. They worked for us normally. The red line bus came whenever it wanted without any specific schedule. Waste our money.",1
City Sightseeing Lisbon should definitely be avoided!,"Absolutely bad, had to wait 1.5 hours for the next bus, while Gray Line (another and much better provider) had a bus stop 5 times.
The comments didn't work either.
The roof also couldn't be closed despite the rain.",1
Worst bus company in Lisbon,This bus was honestly so awful and not worth the money at all!! Do not recommend using them at all! The Lisbon hop-on hop-off or yellow buses looked way better! The bus would consistently drive past and not stop even if it wasn’t full! Had to wait over an hour and a half for one single bus to come. Not worth it at all!,1
Wish I had read all the others review first.,"We found the same things - no air conditioning downstairs in the buses, it was like a sauna down there, the alternative was full on sun upstairs, no usefully commentary on the audio and the tours stop so early (4:30) that we didn't get time to use all three tours.",1
Bad experience you’ll wait over 30 minutes for a bus.,We consistently waited over a half hour for our busses other operators like grey line would have 2 and sometimes 3 busses come by before 1 of the city sightseeing tour busses. Bad experience overall and would not book again. I HIGHLY recommend finding another provider who won’t leave you waiting your day waiting for busses with no audio guides of what you are seeing.,1
Not worth it,"If you want to get to know Lisbon and move around the city, this is not a good option at all, you waste a lot of time, the frequency of arrival and departure of the buses in different parts of the city is too late, we had to take Uber several times to be able to really fulfill our plan of visits to the points of interest, a joke.",2
Waste of money worst ever city bus tour.,"Appalling experience on green route, awful music, no commentary. Driver spent all the time on mobile phone. Two sockets failed to work in a group of 6. Not told limited numbers on bus when booking so risked group being split. At most pick up points customers could not avail of bus due to lack of seats. Would not recommend waste of money. 😡",1
Terrible experience using this company for a tour of Lisbon.,"Worst experience I have ever had on a sightseeing tour!! Had to change seats 7x’s to find a working place for the headphones. Minimal information about the sights/ attractions. Two hours later and very frustrated I gave up and took a taxi back to the cruise ship.

😂🥵",1
Waste of money !!!!,What a waste of money. No audio guide or personal guide. So 1 1/2 hours on a bus not knowing where we were going and no one to complain to !!!!!,1
outdated,"I really can’t recommend this company. The map is behind the paywall, finding the pick up spots is a hassle because half are missing because if construction, getting the location for Bolt or Uber to take you to the pickup is bear impossible because you get coordinates and not addresses. This is especially frustrating for people with limited mobility as is my friend. then there is no way to know when the bus is scheduled to arrive. Setting up a live map should be a given at this day and age. so now we have been waiting an hour at the same pick up spot and have no idea if the bus will even arrive. Also they insist on printing out a receipt. once you have the paper voucher you cant reuse the digital QR. so if you lose it it or forget it you cant get on. why not just use the same QR instead of printing a physical ticket?",1
Rubbish,"Pitiful commentary - mostly music. Learned nothing. Major buildings not mentioned when passed.
No mention of what stop you are at when on the bus.
Finishes at 5.30pm whereas others go until 8pm.
Told we had a 48hr ticket but nowhere does it mention on the actual ticket (leaflet/map says 24hr only)
Wish we had read all the 1 star reviews recently before buying tickets.
City Sightseeing should be ashamed of this - it will ruin their reasonable reputation in other cities.",1
Loss of money,"I think the company is in decline. We used it in other cities and it was cool. But in Lisbon it was a trap. Buses take a long time to pass, until the bus arrives (it seems like it's always the same) there were on average 2 cars passing by. On the blue line, it just didn't pass. That's why they're giving 2 days for the price of one, but it's not worth it.",2
Better to add runs,"The beautiful tours last 48 hours at the cost of 24 hours. But there are few buses, the wait is eternal. You can't use them to see or enter the monuments, at most one... you waste too much time waiting for them. Already started 30' late from stop 1 with the first race. At 5pm it is too early to finish the service.",2
catastrophe,"We bought the ticket in the cruise terminal, as the queue for the red line was very long, we went to the first station on the blue line (every 50 minutes). The stop was not marked at all and after an hour there was still no bus. Back to the cruise center, red bus was right in front of us, after 45 minutes there was still no red bus. The next day there was no chance of getting the bus. We wrote to them and were fobbed off with blabla, NEVER AGAIN!!!",1
Do not use this company,"Beware of scam! The bus looks like the “Lisbon Sightseeing” company that the tourist office told us about. We positioned ourselves on a stop (which for the most part are the same as the competing company) we were fooled by a tout who sold us “CitySightseeing Lisboa” as identical and 2€ cheaper
We understood over the 2 days that they are not quite the same stops and that in terms of timetable nothing is respected.
On several occasions we saw 2 competing buses pass on the blue line and still not ours!! i.e. 45min late
Headphone jacks for audio guides on most buses work poorly or not at all
I strongly advise against this company, maybe the others don't respect schedules well, but at least it wasn't within those deadlines.",1
Avoid the Red Buses,"Experienced travellers, we usually take a hop on hop off tour early after our arrival to get our bearings and get around the city. We’ve even enjoyed a tour at home, in Toronto, to experience being a tourist in the city. However, our experience yesterday in Lisbon with Worldwide City Sightseeing red buses (not to be confused with the Yellow Bus Tours or the Gray Line’s red buses) was terrible. Pre-booking online was the best part of the experience, as we already had our QR code on my cell phone while we awaited the bus. However, we had to wait the better part of an hour for a bus; by contrast three yellow buses and two Gray Line buses arrived in the interim. We wished we had not prebooked. Our bus when it arrived was of course packed and the driver grumpy. She had trouble with her scanner and manually input our QR code. Other passengers were annoyed with us at the delay; if looks could kill. The commentary via the headset was poor. It primarily played music with very, very little info about what we were seeing. It did not even announce stops, so we had trouble knowing where we were on the tour or where we could get off. It really was a waste of time and money. We tried to be good travellers and make the most of it, but eventually we just gave up and hopped off when others on the bus did at a major stop. We walked from there. Don’t waste your time or money with Worldwide City Sightseeing’s red buses.",1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Waste of time and money. Red route - meant to start at 9.30. Driver 20 minutes late and no company rep to field the questions and concerns. Blue route afterwards - commentary failed after 10 minutes so it was nothing more than a bus ride. Would have been better to spend Euro1.60 on a metropolitan bus -we would have got as much out of it. Spoke with the rep when we got back who tested one socket and said it works fine (with a shrug of the shoulders). E mailed the company head office and got a similar, but written, sorry but not sorry in response. Do not waste time or money with this company - you have been warned. Go with Lisbon Sightseeing or the Yellow Bus (or indeed the numerous Tuk Tuk tours) instead.",1
"Red line is fine, avoid the blue. Needs updating.","I wish I had seen these reviews before booking!

I got a pair of tickets for the red & blue line.
Overall the red line was alright. The audio in both lines are dreadful, maybe 1-2 sentences every 10-15 minutes. We passed so many beautiful locations with little to no commentary. There also (at times) wasn’t enough time to get off the bus - there was one stop we tried to get off but the bus took off again before we could get out! Some of the stops are in very random locations, and the signs are not easy to identify. No timetable to be found on signage or online, which is a shame as other city tours with the same company do provide this. Buses themselves are old and could do with some attention.

The red line mostly ran to time, but the blue line is painful. We ended up getting an Uber after a stop in the evening, as we were running out of time to get to the next attraction! Even if on time, 1 hour intervals are crazy! We also did make note that the City Sightseeing bus is the last to arrive at stop 1 Marques de Pombal at 9:30am.

Overall, red line is fine, I would absolutely avoid the blue line. But maybe use another company instead.",2
Absolute waste of money. Be warned,"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY! This was a totally dreadful experience which was the only blot on an otherwise amazing visit to Lisbon. If only I had read these reviews first! Unfortunately for us we picked up the company leaflet in our hotel and trusted that it would be a worthwhile experience. It so wasn’t. Please believe all reviews that say the wait for each bus was painful. We waited over 45 minutes at the tours biggest attraction and were not surprised to see the driver we had on our first journey. I wouldn’t be surprised if they only have one bus!!
We got stung €30 because we were sold two routes which we thought we would do over two days. The next morning we again waited for the ‘Green route’ bus… I genuinely believe I’d still be waiting.
The other Lisbon bus company with the yellow buses maybe better as we saw more of their buses.
I shall be writing to the company to ask for a refund!!",1
Yellow bus. Sightseeing Portugal red line.,Bus did not stop in front of the stop. Make sure you are ready for the exit on time. The driver let us drive an extra stop.,1
JUST DONT DO IT!,"Please read the other reviews, it's not a coincidence that there are so many complaints! I wish we had done our homework. We had to wait for over an hour and were later told that there were no delays at that moment. To make things worse we were denied entry with a baby, this after we had already purchased our tickets. When we complained we were laughed at in the face.",1
Don't bother,"Ridiculously infrequent (we waited 70 minutes) to the point that you didn't want to get off the bus because you weren't sure when the next bus would come. The audio announcements were extremely limited, and offered no pre notification of the upcoming stops, or any attractions best served by that stop. The printed maps they give you are such poor quality, that some stops are impossible to locate.",1
DONT DO IT,If you want to waste a whole day get on this bus. Worst experience ever. Uber is way faster and more reliable. Do not fall for this scam. DONT DO IT,1
Never again,"If I could leave a rating if zero, I'd leave a rating of zero.
We were rained on severely with no accommodation whatsoever from the bus staff to keep us dry and comfortable, some staff members were very rude, nine of the drivers have microphones so if you're not sitting directly behind the driver you could rarely hear what stop you're at or when you should get off, and the schedule is a joke that's just not funny. We spent a much bigger part of our one day in Sintra waiting for these stupid busses and we got so wet from all the rain (both while waiting for the bus that was always running late and on some of the busses which only had the first couple of rows shielded from the elements) that it became a thoroughly miserable experience.",1
Take the other line,Go with the yellow bus or Grayline. This one takes forever to arrive. By the time it came the other companies had 2 busses already gone.,1
DISCARD THIS OPTION!,"DISCARD THIS OPTION! 22 euros thrown in the trash! We only managed to catch the bus at the train station at the beginning and the one from the Palacio da Pena back, after an hour of waiting. We had to desperately pay for a tuk tuk to get there because we couldn't find the stop, which is not at all clear and where it is, it is not clear what the schedule is. The map directs you to a page of times that do not work. The public bus 434 meanwhile, passing constantly. The audio guides do not match what you see, or most of them do not work. Totally wasted money and time!!!!",1
The tour is not worth the money,"The tour is not worth the money! We waited for the bus for an hour at the Park of Nations in Lisbon. During this time, we drove 2 other buses from other companies. There is no schedule anywhere, just stand and wait. The audio guide is terrible. Portuguese music plays on headphones 90% of the time on the route. In the remaining 5%, when the voice says something, it is an absolutely unrelated and not interesting story in 2 sentences. As a result, we drove and read everything on Wikipedia. The impressions were bad. It costs a maximum of 5 euros for the red and blue route.",1
Waste of time,"Bus taken from the port which supposedly stops regularly but ultimately almost never stops... The comments in the headphones are minimal and we have fado on repeat.
To get back on the bus you have to be able to find the stop (very poorly marked).
We spent more than two hours on the bus so as not to see much, in short, to escape!",1
HORRIBLE,Scam no commentary on bus sit on bus for extended time not moving. Random streets. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!! Other companies to choose from when stopped by someone selling tickets ask which company,1
A TOTAL SCAM. AVOID.,"Buyer beware!

I bought four single line (green) tickets for 20€ each for me and my family members and we got on the bus.

NONE of the 16 Channels available worked, you only heard static or faint but somehow overblown music. The four of us tried multiple seats, we could find no plug that deliverd intelligble audio.

The driving was horrible, the bus just speeds through town, robbing us of the time needed to look around and at least enjoy the view.

We hopped off the bus on the next stop and were so aggrivated by the experience that we never boarded another bus again.

As if that wasn't bad enough, i contacted the company immediatly with a request for a refund, 80€ for the above mentioned torture is nothing to sneeze at.

As of now it's been over a week and over 5 emails and they are not willing to offer me a full refund. in none of the emails was there an excuse or even an apology. This seems to be the modus operandi of this company.

in short, this is a tourist scam, must avoid!",1
Blue route is Random!!,"Blue route is a joke, we sat on the bus for nearly two hours and everyone was bored! The green route was good but could have done with a personal commentary. We asked three times what was the last bus from the castle and was told 5.30 p.m. so we duly arrived at 5.10 and when the bus came we couldn't board it as there was no room so had to get a taxi back to the hotel! When we approached the lady who sold us the tickets she told us it wasn't even high season and there was nothing she could do , so no offer of a partial refund. We watched the Gray line buses come and go and all round seemed a better company but as we didn't use them couldn't say for definite.",2
Buyers beware…,"Bad Experience. We did the “Iconic” (Green Line). For starters, the audio doesn’t work. In none of the 2 buses we were able to hop the audio worked in multiple seats we tried. And they know because when we mentioned it to the driver he told us he knew. Too bad, your problem Mr. Tourist.
Second: your online voucher is ONLY good to hop in your FIRST leg. Do not lose it! The first driver will not explain this and then the subsequent drivers will not let you get in. I didn’t cave and went to the back of the bus. When I call customer service, they told me : you need to buy another trip!!
Third: Some people in the bus wanted to report our driver. She drove like crazy in the narrow streets of Lisbon sometimes getting too close to kids and pedestrians in general.

Dear Management: we are tourist trying to enjoy the few day and dollars we have. Do not scam us!..you need us. Just be smart.",1
"Terrible experience, no support.","I was not able to find the stops. Their website functions so poorly, the map was hard to use. I had ubers take me to two stops. Eventually, I gave up. I emailed their customer service asking for a refund. They sent me back several questions (which stops did you try, what time etc. etc.) through SEVERAL rounds of emails, only to let me know they would not refund me. Terrible service. I never even saw a bus go by the whole weekend i was there.",1
Choose a different company!,"Chose City Sightseeing as used them a few times before with excellent experiences... although NOT in Lisbon, and never would again.

Smooth service at the port - 4 tickets bought, with ease, smooth transaction, good start. 3/4 seats in our rows didn't work (sound).. and lots of others saying the same. Earphones are awful - hard, uncomfortable and tinny.

Was assured we could stay on the bus for a round trip from/to cruise terminal. 1st lie. We're on 'red route' and needed to swap to 'blue route' to get back to terminal. So hopped off for lunch at the same stop we'd pick up the blue.

Went to blue stop at 3pm - was told it wouldn't be there until 4pm now (was a 30m trip to port, and needed to be on board by 5.30pm max).4pm came and went, no bus. 4.10pm, 4.20pm.. was told it's delayed due to traffic and should be there by 4.30pm. That would have been a 90 min wait (was told at the port they're every 40 mins). At 4.25pm with no bus in sight, I flagged a cab.. and was on the boat within 30 mins.

Lots of people were waiting by this stage.. perhaps 50-70. If the bus was full, then what?! I wasn't going to risk it. All the while, there was a bus there ""out of service"" with the driver taking a nap in the back. And the reo just shrugged her shoulders, smiled and said it'd be all OK... very stressful, and frustrating.

Choose a different company - saw SO MANY buses from Sightseeing Lisbon, Greyline and Tuk Tuks, constantly pucking up and dropping off.. v rare to see a City Sightseeing one... not worth the stress.

€95 ish spent to not even do a full route. No working speakers. Severe lack of buses and resources. Awful experience.",1
City sight seeing you are very posturing,"Bad experience, money wasted. We went to the sad palace and waited 1 hour and 30 minutes for a bus that never arrived. Since we opted to take a taxi. That 1 hour 30 minutes it was raining, very windy and very cold. They only want the money. Lea, people don't care! I am not going to allow anyone around me to take one of these buses, at least in Sintra.",1
“Hop Off” This One!,"TLDR: “Hop off” City Sightseeing Lisbon before you “hop on”!

City Sightseeing Lisbon (CSL) runs too many routes with too few resources, resulting in long wait times once one “hops off” someplace. We noted that THREE competing Yellow Buses arrived at our stop in Belem, for ex., on the CSL Red Route, for each CSL bus that showed up.

Once aboard, we discovered that a surprising number of speaker jacks were either disabled or so worn as to be intermittent. Three sets of cheaply-made CSL headphones also failed on us. The sound was only monaural, anyway, so there was no need to put jacks in each ear! The (recorded) English narration was quite sparse, and no more than three sentences were provided about any given point of interest. The intervals between narrations were filled with long, long stretches of repetitive, sleepy-sad Portuguese guitar music and singing.

CSL route selection shows a distinct lack of strategic planning. The
nonsensical Blue Route, for instance, highlights for tourists the disheveled port area, including many crumbling, graffiti-scarred warehouses, car repair shops, shipping insurers, alleys, and 100 blocks of lookalike residential high rises. In our judgment this Route could be eliminated or at least vastly tightened up, with the bus transit-time saved devoted to running this or other routes more often (to reduce the waits).

CSL tries to do too much with too little, but this ambition doesn’t add value for the rider. We note that hop-on/off tour bus lines even in Paris have only about 15 stops, but each stop is richly covered by an engaging, enthusiastic narration in dialogue between multiple characters, with plenty of general city facts and “Did You Know”-type quizzes filling the gaps between stops. They also call out each stop and bid the departing passengers adieu. CSL’s current narration is clunky and strictly amateur by comparison. To provide value for money, CSL should hire a scriptwriter and audio production team, and should re-baseline all its routes with a view toward simplification.

Finally, CSL’s claim to be environment-friendly is belied by the fact that our diesel-powered bus idled for *40 minutes*, in nice weather, before we finally departed on the Blue Route. It’s possible that no CSL bus is ever shut off during the working day — not only making for an air quality disaster, but dissipating the company’s own profits.",2
Terrible. Don’t bother.,"The worst hop on, hop off bus tour that we have experienced - and we went for City Sightseeing as we’ve used them before.
The buses are infrequent (green line is every 2 hours, for example). Purple and red lines are almost identical routes but in reverse.
The commentary was terrible: it either repeated itself, stopped mid-sentence or was out of synch. There was very little information given when it did work, with long periods of silence. An absolute joke.
The driver of the green route bus spent most of the journey on his phone driving one-handed.
The Gray Line hop on / hop off tours seemed far more frequent and better organised. We should’ve done more research before we chose City Sightseeing. Lesson learned because we completely wasted our money this time.",1
"Avoid, tourist rip-off","Writing this whilst experiencing the 'blue route', 50 mins into the trip. Little to no information of surroundings. This is so boring, what a waste of a morning.

Did the 'red route' yesterday - same, we couldn't find a seat that the ear phones would work in and so no information. Based on today's experience, we didn't miss much.

Will be requesting a refund when we eventually find somewhere suitable to get off.....shame we can request a refund for the 2 half days wasted on what is no more than a boring, uncomfortable bus ride!",1
No spots on the bus.....terrible customer service!!!!,"TERRIBLE!!!! We waited 40 minutes for the bus (totally normal and to be expected). We had a pass for the green line...the purple and red line buses showed up basically empty. When our Green Line bus showed up, it was a tiny van and it was completely full. We were told it would be a 2-hour wait for the next Green Line bus with no guarantee that we would have a spot on the bus. We asked to be put on one of the other buses but were told we would have to purchase tickets for those buses.

We decided to pass on the bus and just walk around the city. When we returned home, I explained the situation to the company and requested a refund, but they refused. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they stopped emailing me. I have since sent 2 other requests to the company, none of which have even been replied to.

TERRIBLE!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!!!",1
The worst CSS I have used in Europe,"Endless stops without time coordination between them. You wait 15-20 minutes in each one so the journey becomes endless.
The audio guide is more like background music because the explanations are very brief and fill in the rest with minutes and minutes of music.
I've been waiting in Pombal for 20 minutes for the bus to start. And yesterday it was the same tone.
Avoid this company in Lisbon even though it works very well in Athens, Paris and other destinations I have visited.",1
"Terrible, and I was generous","Terrible!
Things that are wrong:
- Absurd hours
-buses that stop in out of the way places
- audio that didn't work in 3 of the 6 seats tested and in the others it crackled or had an unbearable volume
-it's raining inside the lower deck of the bus
-driver incapable of starting in a timely manner at traffic lights and driving in a minimally smooth manner: better that he change jobs
-high cost
Tip: use public transport!",1
Better walk or take the metro/ Tram/ train,"This company has only old busses and goes in low frequency which means long waiting. Headphones are cheap make and often don't work, or the plug 8ns on the seats are broken. And if you re lucky and both works, we got to listen to music. Explanation and guidance is very scarce. I recommend to choose another way of getting around. For that 30 EUR its a ripp- off. Can imagine the countless private TukTtuks are a better choice.",1
Punctuality not being maintained and the trip is different for going and coming,"The yellow bus was not on time and the worst thing was that the return trip, we had to sit from the same spot we got down. We wasted lot of time on our return and today because of the traffic we had to be in the bus for more than 2 1/2 hrs instead of 1 1/2 hr",2
DO NOT GO ON ANY OF THESE LISBON SIGHTSEEING BUSES,"Awful. DO NOT go on the Lisbon City Sightseeing tour unless you want to spend three and a half hours being stuck on a bus in slow moving trafficon city ring roads whilst seeing no actual sights. A complete rip for €27.

- We were told by the vendor selling the tickets outside the bus that the duration was two hours - we were on for over three and a half hours
- We weren't given earphones when boarding the bus
- The ""sightseeing"" tour had very little sights to see, and spent all of the journey stuck in traffic on main roads for three hours

- When we became concerned we would not make it back to our cruise ship in time for departure, the driver said we would be back at cruise port in 25 mins, but it actually took more than an hour to get there

- The driver was taking a telephone call for the whole journey, and was rude to ourselves and several other passengers who were also worried about getting back to their cruise ship

- After we got back to the cruise terminal, there were no remaining City Sightseeing staff left to complain to and request a refund from.",1
Avoid city SIGHTSEEING in Lisbon,"Worst experience ever.
Few trips and few vehicles always full, not adequate for the tickets sold and in terrible condition.
All the other competing companies have new vehicles, staff everywhere and continuous runs worthy of the hop on hop off concept.
Expensive prices for a non-existent service.
ABSOLUTELY AVOID",1
Disappointed,"Indulgently unacceptable, we are in Lisbon waiting an inordinate amount of time to catch the blue line bus without any information about the multiple delays. The staff kindly try to transfer us another color line but that is not our wish. I draw attention to those who wish to avail themselves of this service. Here, where we wait, the buses of another competing company perfectly serve their audience. Unfortunately it was a tragic experience for us and all this under heavy rain. Be careful with your choices. I refer to the date Saturday, October 28, 2023.",1
Don’t bother with this!,"A waste of money! Very bad signage. Couldn’t see where we had to stand. Long waits. We are in our 70’s and are well travelled. I wouldn’t recommend this way of getting around Sintra at all. There are many much better alternatives. The only positive thing that we can say, is that the drivers were very good.",1
Avoid. Use someone else.,"Utter crap.

No buses available at the cruise terminal unless you wanted to wait 1hr+ for the blue route (and apparently the blue route is good if you like to see an industrial estate covered in graffiti). We were instructed to walk to ""Red-route"" as this would be more frequent and easier to get on. This is a 20 minute walk away. They were wrong. We walked to Cais do Sodre and waited nearly 1 hour for a bus. Went to Belem and waited nearly 1 hour again for a bus. Meanwhile, ""Lisbon Sightseeing"" and ""Yellow Buses"" turned up like clockwork every 10-15 minutes. Audio guide also completely non-functional. We tried multiple sockets on multiple buses and got nothing but silence. So either broken on not switched on.

Its just a really poor service. Don't bother with it. Especially if you are coming off a Cruise, these guys are front and centre in the port building as you get off. Just walk on by and see one of the other companies. We know it will be busy on port days with multiple ships in, but you know... put more buses on or don't over-sell what you have. Its not difficult.

And of course, by the time we'd made it back to the terminal, these guys have scarpered (and it was still within what I would call ""normal working hours"" on a weekday). I suspect they know full well they'd get a load of angry customers facing them and that is why they don't hang around.

Currently trying to get a refund off them but whilst they are replying promptly, of course they're fobbing me off with ""bus frequency is posted at the kiosk"" and ""we check all the audio systems daily"".

Well... for the avoidance of doubt their own website says Lisbon buses will run up to every 30 minutes (not our experience) and if you just look at any one of many reviews on here and other sites, you'll see lack of audio commentary is a regular complaint. So they're either lying or the people in the office simply do not know what is going on on the ground and think everything is hunky dory. It isn't. It needs to be a lot better than this for the money.",1
Don’t waste your money,There was less than 1 minute of commentary on a 1 hour & 45 minute tour. Many of the earphone jacks didn’t work. We went by numerous key sites with zero commentary. Truly embarrassing for a city tour.,1
A pure scam.,"We were aiming for the blue line. No timetable displayed and the attendant gave us the wrong time. We miss the bus. We continue on foot and take a visit. At the exit, we wait for the bus for 1h30. In vain. Still no info, no timetable. We finally take a taxi. From the so-called hop on hop off for 54 euros. If you have the chance to get on a bus, don't get off. The chances of getting back there are almost zero... In short, run away...",1
BUS DEPARTURE FROM THE PORT,"We took the bus from the port towards the city center passing by the Bélem tower. Journey time 1h30
Then for the return Blue Line We waited 1 hour without seeing a bus
We went to the terminus on foot and challenged the announced times
We were around twenty people, the company arranged a bus to return directly to the port
We did not see the blue circuit duration from the terminal 40 mins
Lisbon assessment we only saw the bus in 4 hours on site
Strongly not recommended
September 2023",2
More than entertaining it ends up being torture,"The tourist bus is a scam, a line saturated with people who don't get off for fear of not being able to get on the next one. The bus was packed at the stops and couldn't pick up anyone else. The tour starts out entertaining and ends up being torture with so many turns and uninteresting places, a waste of money but above all of time, especially for those of us who are going on a cruise.",1
Timo,"It's a real scam. Very expensive for what the tour offers. There is no coordination of schedules between one line and another. The condition of the bus is terrible, it was raining and there were leaks everywhere, all the seats inside were wet. The headphone jacks do not work for the most part, and those that do work have little explanation and bad sound. The only thing that is spared is the driver.",1
WORTHLESS,"The bus takes the route it promises but it is absurd to pay €22 per person since you cannot see any monuments from the bus. The audio guide did not work in Spanish and the driver was not responsible for the incident, he was not friendly at all. Sintra is beautiful but the important monuments are pure business for them, you cannot see them even from the outside without paying. The bus is not worth it at all, you only get dizzy and waste time.",1
Biggest scam of my life,"We bought Red, purple and blue route.
In the morning, we did Roja, a lot of music and little explanation. In the afternoon, the blue, total waste of time, route through suburbs without any tourist interest and with the audio in total silence 90% of the time. Tremendous lack of respect for the time spent by tourists.",1
Very bad,"Got the ticket for 2 days for 3 lines. On the way to Belem everything was ok. The problem was the return. The stops are not clearly marked on the maps. Buses run once an hour. The biggest problem is finding the stops and it takes about half an hour of walking. Lisbon is best visited by public transport or, if you are a walker, on foot.",1
I feel ripped off as a tourist,"🚫 Don't fall into the trap, they tell you that you have 24 hours to enjoy the tours but the traffic is chaos, schedules are not met... terrible management and a shame for money, it is necessary to make an immediate change and a lesson",1
AVOID CITYSIGHTSEEING PORTUGAL!!!,"There are 2 companies that do tours with Rossi buses. Absolutely avoid the one that says CITY SIGHTSEEING PORTUGAL!!! Old buses from 1970, noisy, the audio doesn't work, and when it does they make you hear the fado. The timetables are obscene: the buses run every hour or every hour and a half!!! Take the other partner!!! I forgot: the prices! Out of place for the service that does not exist.",1
Unfriendly and terrible service!,"Terrible service, we were running 1 min late because my 80 year old mom got stuck at the

Horrible,Si j'avais pu mettre zéro en note je n'aurai pas hésité ! Une honte !! Le centre de Lisbonne en travaux (ok pas leur faute) sauf que personne ne vous prévient bien évidemment et du coup nous avons visité uniquement les zones industrielles et le coté moche des côtes. Impossible de prendre le pass pour une journée deux journées obligatoires. 57 € pour voir des bidonvilles et zones industrielles. Super.... Finalement obligé de rentrer en taxi. Bref une expérience horrible !!! Fuyez !!!!!,1
Very disappointing,Most disappointing experience of our holiday. This is a rip off! The bus was late leaving the station and once we had visited the Moorish castle and the Peña palace we waited half an hour and no bus came. There was no signage about where to get the bus and no timetable displayed. We ended up catching the local bus for an extra cost to get to the National palace and then walked back to the station. Will be advising our many friends to choose alternatives when in Sintra!,1

Waste of money,"Shambolic timetable information. Website blocked by my iPhone and no timetable at bus stops. Hopping back on very difficult. Hard to find and identify the bus stops, very long waits. Not clear which buses serve which colour routes. Too many empty buses polluting the city. Front of bus says ticket valid for 24 hours, staff said 48 hours. Use a small electric vehicle instead, many tuktuks available.",2
Ce n’è di meglio,"I punti della fermata non sono chiari, quindi ti ritrovi a girare per cercare il cartello. Ti fanno la cartina ma dovrebbero essere più chiara

"Pésima, dinero tirado a la basura….","Un grave error contratar con City Sightseeing Sintra. No tienen combinación ninguna hay que esperar más de hora y media, nada puntuales, hemos tenido finalmente que coger el público tras contratar con ellos, vaya 40 euros tirados a la basura… UN ENGAÑO!!!!!!!!",1
je ne recommande pas,"Je ne recommande pas du tout, en hiver les bus passent toutes les heures ou jamais.
Les arrêts sont compliquées à trouver, ce n'est pas du tout rentable !",1
Avoid if you value your safety,Avoid if you value your safety . We boarded the bus on 4/1 in Lisbon . Within 10 minutes our driver who thought he was on a F1 circuit had hit a tree . Fortunately we were the only people on the top deck . The bus was covered in glass . I hit my head . No one gave a damm . The driver was laughing with his mates back at the terminal where we returned. No offer of refund. I left my name and address nothing. All emails to their support desk get returned. Absolutely b disgusting!!!!,1
English speaking guide?,Very nice but English needed to be much better for us to understand. There are so many operators. Would pick another……we had fun still.,2
Disappointing!,"It was very disappointing. Nobody showed up for the tuk tuk tour. We were left standing on the street waiting! We finally made a phone call and the provider told us they were unable to make it. This is the second time we have used Viator through TripAdvisor and nobody has showed up. We previously booked a tour in Venice, Italy, and another one in Istanbul and both times neither one of those tour guys showed up. We will never use this service again.",1
GetYourGuide and CityTuk 3-hour tour of Lisbon was the worst!,"First, the driver (Andres) was 40 minutes late picking me up at the meeting point. I had to contact both his company (CityTuk) and the booking company (GetYourGuide) to find out where he was. I was told he thought my tour was supposed to be later in the day. Secondly, his English skills were terrible and the information he provided about the city was minimal. I finally gave up trying to understand him and just looked at the scenery. I've seen many other tuktuks equipped with microphones for the driver. That might have made a little difference as he mumbled most of the time. Thirdly, I understand driving in Lisbon is challenging at best, but even when we were on back streets with no traffic, he was speeding then slamming on the brakes every few feet. Since the streets were wet from a recent rainshower, we skidded down several hills. I finally started looking for seat belts, but they weren't functional. I cut the tour short by 40 minutes and asked him to drop me off near my hotel.",1
Just a drive around the city,"I do not recommend this tuk tuk company. I booked the 3 hour city tour which lists multiple stops along the itinerary for durations of 10-15 minutes. We did not make the stops, all that we did was ""pass by"". We just drove past the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos that lists a 15 minute stop, not even enough time to take a picture! When we showed the driver the Itinerary she said that she had never sen this itinerary! The driver spoke to the office on our behalf, feeling bad that we did not get what we expected, they would not lower the price of the tour. After returning home from our trip, I reach out to the head office concerning my complaint and did not hear back from them at all. If all that you want is a drive around, any tuk tuk company can do that for you.I expected more for 170 Euros!",2
Forgot us,"Lost our reservation so left us standing on the hot sidewalk across from the cruise ship. Called them using our international hotspot. They finally found the reservation but said they had no drivers. They called 20 minutes later and said they had a driver. Buy this time over 90 minutes had passed and we found someone who's group cancelled on him. Glad I didn't pay in advance. Don't pay in advance, wait to see if they actually show up.",1
A very bad day in Sintra,"I paid 714 euro for a private daily tour with an Italian guide but what I got was what a rasta not-very-clean girl that only spoke Portuguese and some Spanish, not even English. She just drove and left us alone to visit every place and did not say a single word throughout the entire day. During visits, we listened to other groups’ guides and read info on the internet. She picked us late in the morning at the hotel and continued the whole day, having no idea of where to park, no plans for the day, skipped half of the locations expected when I bought the trip. During the day I talked on the phone with the local agency and Viator but they did not help, they just wanted to sell me a trip knowing that they had not a guide available and no refund was provided. Unfortunately our day was totally spoilt and that is not refundable.",1
Tours civitatis lousy service,"4 tours that cancel us, today to go to auschwitz ...cancel it the same day. that did not open, terrible service, they must have information of the holidays , do not hire civitatis, besides that the only tours that gave us the one day and another at night were wrong, we repeated tour.always contracted with them , never again",1
Horrifying ordeal,"We introduce ourselves to five friends in the Obelisk Square and assign a Guide: Manolito.
He starts to look at us badly and then, he asks us to come very close, to which a person of the group, they tell him that he is heard well, that it is not necessary.
Then he starts talking about his country, Colombia, so we look at each other, as if not understanding anything. Which he doesn't like.
When the tour starts, and the list passes, they say it is mandatory to answer: Manolito here, making a hand sign as if we were clowns. When it comes to my group's turn, the person who made the Reservation raises his hand and says: Here.
The Guide doesn't like this and he starts clowning around saying that's not the formula, that you have to clown around and say: Manolito here.
Since we're not willing to clown around, it drives us out of the Tour.
We travel muncho and always hire the Tours with Civitatis. Until yesterday the experiences were very good. Manolito's an unpresentable.",1
disappointing,The boy did not let us do the excursion because we were with another group that we met in port and we had squared to meet here and for them 4 and us 5 told me to go to another company for the first time this happens to me with this company and I always use it in all destinations,1
"What a shame, they kicked us out for going on two reservations. CIVITATIS SCAM","Incredible, we make two reservations for 6 and another for 5 with different names and emails, we show up at the agreed time and they kick us out rudely and without explanations, nor do they stop to reason saying that we are a group. We have done many freetours and we have never had any problems. CIVITATIS should look at how it manages these things.
TIP if you make a reservation with your friends/family, when you get there pretend you don't know each other.
I have no words to express the disappointment we felt.",1
Shameful,"Shameful. We are 3 families that always travel together. The day before we did the Tour in Sintra xon Civitatis without any problem and very well. Today in Lisbon they refuse to accept us because there are more than 6 people despite having made 3 reservations. Very bad manners and without any coherent explanation, it seemed that we had done something illegal. It is the first time something like this has happened to us and we travel a lot. Thank God we were able to rejoin another Tour from another company despite not having a reservation. We naturally thank this other guide that has been compiled from us. We will never organize anything with Civitatus and we will never recommend it.",1
Disastrous experience with Take Free Tours (subcontracted by Civitatis),"We go to the indicated meeting point and they do not allow us to access the tour because we are a group of 6 people and another of 3 people (with independent reservations), arguing that there are 9 of us and the maximum is 6.
We have tried to explain to them several times that at no time did the 9 of us intend to go together, but they have not even bothered to understand it.

The attitude of Mariana and Kike has been quite undesirable, showing an absolute lack of understanding and collaboration.

Now let's just hope that they don't charge us 5 euros per person for not taking the tour (because they haven't allowed us to)",1
Scam on a visit to Lisbon with Civitatis,"The tour guides were very unpleasant to us for being Spanish and with a slight touch of homophobia. Never again a tour with them. They rejected people, at our time specifically 15 people. The guide says that the answer is Civitatis",1
Pesima consideración frente a un pedido de cambio,"Pésimo trato , pesima atención al cliente. Desaconsejo contratar con CIVITATIS ! Hemos debido solicitar un cambio en medio de un viaje de vacacionesy no se nos otorgó Una modo muy feo de aguarnos unas vacaciones. Han sido sumamente desconsiderados NO CONTRATAR con ellos!",1
Take a taxi from the Lisbon Airport,"Be careful when booking your airport shuttle with this company since it sometimes takes a longer time to get through the Lisbon airport than the time that the shuttle company will wait for you. It took us almost 2 hours from the time our plane landed until the time that we finally had arrived at the airport lobby to meet our pre paid shuttle driver. We were bussed to the terminal from the plane, had lengthy lines at customs and waited an exceptionally long time for our luggage. By that time our driver had left. We did not have our Portuguese SIM cards to call in time to ask him to wait for us. When I borrowed a phone to call the company, we were told that they would be there in 5 minutes. When that didn't happen after another 30 minutes, I called back and spoke with a very rude woman who told me that in fact, we were not going to be picked up since the time that the driver would wait was an hour and a half and we would not be getting any refund. I have travelled throughout the world and have always ordered shuttles for convenience. This is the first time that the driver has left us stranded at the airport. I don't know what the solution is, since I understand that a driver cannot wait all day at the airport and the confirmation did stipulate that the driver would wait for only 1.5 hours. We ended up taking a taxi to downtown which ended up being cheaper than the shuttle, so that would probably be your best bet since you might get held up a very long time in the airport as we were.",1
Disappointed,"Disappointing, poorly maintained garden, dirty paths and benches (too many peacocks and ducks..)
Too bad because it is well located near the Belém Tower.",1
Very nice store..great sellers..I bought for almost 100€ of soap and I was asked 1€20 for a paper bag.,Very nice store great sellers..I bought for nearly 100€ of soap I was asked 1€20 for a small bag .inadmissible...last time I buy these soaps..,1
Visiting the coach museum,It's a pitty how they take care of such precious vehicles. They should have much more protection from light and other agressions.,2
Too bad about the bathroom.,To go to the bathroom you need a drink ticket. But if you want to go again you have to submit ANOTHER ticket and so on. D right?. Illegal and mean. I'm not coming back.,1
AUDIO TOUR ON YOUR OWN PHONE - DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE TECHNOLOGY,"This is an awful tour and I have asked for a refund but none is forthcoming. You have to dowload an app and then download the tour, take headphones for your own phone - all of which was complicated and not made clear at the outset. When we got there it wasnt clear whether or not we had bought a ticket to get in and the tour or just the tour and needed then to buy an actual ticket to get in. No wifi so couldnt access any information and then the queue was 2.5 hours to get in. We did not queue up as it was hot and 2 of our party were in there 80's and it was too long... so it was just a complete waste of money. It wasnt clear when I booked it that you had to download stuff and take headphones.",1
St J,"This was a huge monastery, with very large rooms and very interesting architecture, but we have seen so many different museums and things. This did not stand out and you had to wait in a huge line even with buying tickets online beforehand . there are too many people traveling it’s not fun when you have to wait in long lines so if you want to wait in line go see it but it’s huge place with a bunch of big empty rooms",1
Scam. Scam. Scam.,Scam—ticket didn’t work. It had someone else name and another date. Total scam. Waste of time. Avoid this company at all costs. I’ll be doing a chargeback.,1
no eticket received,"the eticket was never received, only a pdf stating this is not your ticket. I folliowed the instructions to download ticket however the ticket was never emailed nor texted. I had to buy another ticket on site.",1
Too Long a Wait!,The lines at these two attractions are unbelievable. We arrived at the Belem Tower 15 minutes after opening and waited an hour and 40 minutes before we were able to enter the Tower. We had plans for the afternoon and were unable to visit the Monastery.,2
Unimpressive and overpriced,"Overpriced. Long queue. Outside looks impressive but when you get in very little to see.
Was quoted in Aus $ but charged in Euros and was unable to cancel.",1
Too long queue yet we got there at 9am.,"We thought that purchasing electronic tickets would help us skip the line.....well no, we waited in line for 1 1/2 hours before returning.",1
Disappointed by this first experience,reserving the ticket was of no use to us given that we still had to stand in the single queue (more than an hour). We were not able to visit the church which was closed to visitors due to the celebration of a wedding.,1
Awful,"Not as advertised, difficulty getting logged into the app, which is completely separate from Tripadvisor / Viator. Awful.",1
Would you like to wait 2 hours?,"It should be a Skip the Line ticket, but the only queue you can skip with this ticket is the ticket sales line. And there is no queue at all, because everyone buys online these days. So, since I wasn't looking forward to a 2 hour wait (times 2), I ended up viewing both attractions from the outside only.
Worthless scam, this ticket!",1
Not worth it,"The ques at the monastery were so long we didn't even bother (at least 5 hours). Very impressive from the outside. Next Belem tower excitement back, no another 3 hour que. My youngest daughter persisted and was not bowled over enough to say the wait was worth while. Do this at a time when Lisbon is not busy.",2
Awful experience,"It was an hour wait for entry even with this ticket
Such a complicated system of down loading app to acsess the guide … once in Lisbon it used so much data & it only was only available 24 hours before
I DIDNT EVEN GO IN
TERRIBLE WASTE OF Time & money",1
bad phone service,"The phones are useless, 2 of them do not work and are out of service, they do not respond to emails and it is as if the property only existed in photos, maybe fake.",1
Venue great - but E-Tickets did not were possible scam,The tickets were not accepted at the venue- the security guard said it was a scam. Thankfully he took pity on us and granted us access. However the tickets did not work.,1
No audio and difficulty getting tickets,"Booked the ticket and ‘get tickets’ link doesn’t work. Work around was to go to trip advisor and email ticket to myself. No link to download audio. Hoping the operator will respond to my text.
Hoping the actual visit tomorrow goes well.",1
Waste of my time and my money! Is a NO go!,Save your money and time . This place is not worth it your time or your money. Some walls and nothing else. Get few beers instead and you’ll be happier.,1
Waiting time for entry / price / visit,"The monastery is nice, it has very beautiful architecture.

However, the 40 min queue for entry knowing that we were already there before the site opened, as well as the price of the visit are not worth the visit to the monastery which is short and with little information in my opinion

It’s up to everyone to have their own experience now!",2
Not worth of it! Don’t buy this!,"Castle ticket is only 15 euro each and 2 tickets are only 30 euro. The charges to me from it is 62 euro which bundles useless Service like city audio. It is to me a deceive. The only good thing was that the customer service from Greece was nice. Other than that, this service is highly un recommended! Don’t take it, you will be regretted paying double for nothing!",1
Une honte ! A éviter absolument !,"62€ payés pour visiter le château emblématique de Lisbonne et pas de possibilité de télécharger malgré mes e-mails et mes relances au tour opérateur c’est un scandal! Grosse arnaque! A fuir absolument! (Pour info l’entrée au Chateau ne coûte que 15€, j’´aurais donc du payer seulement 30…). Ils vendaient aussi un audio guide pour visiter la ville impossible également à télécharger. A éviter à tout prix",1

Fado music was lovely; the dinner was not,"We went at the suggestion of friends (she grew up in Portugal). After my wife informed the wait staff that she was a pescatarian, we ordered soup -- and after consuming most of it, she found pieces of meat in it! Then she ordered a fish meal but it also came with pieces of meat!!! I ordered veal and they brought me chunks of beef (taste was ok but nothing memorable). At least they ""comped"" us on our glasses of wine.",2
Not worth it,"Fado, good. Food, average. Service, poor.

We arrived and quickly the reception area started to fill up with people. We had booked for 8pm and got there in plenty of time. We were seated and then the wait started. 15 minutes before we were given water another 15 before our order was taken. We ordered a bottle of wine which was poured but then stored in a wine cooler 2 tables over. As the waiter never came back to serve us the wine we ended up getting it ourselves (disturbing another couple). We were offered bread about 45 mins in but no butter or anything else to go with it. Just before the Fado started we got our starter. 15 mins of Fado which was excellent. We then waited 15 mins after Fado for our main. My companion had Octopus which was a little tough, I had cod which was good. 15 more minutes of Fado. We then left.

For what we were told is a high end restaurant, the service was poor. We fed back to the hotel (as we booked it through their recommendation. Many famous people have visited there and I am sure they got better service than we did. Not made to feel special, just a number. We both felt we were forgotten about. The waiter advised us service was not included in the bill however we did not feel the service was there so did not leave a tip. Normally I am a good tipper for great service but not on this occasion. I would suggest there are better places to go who would value your custom more.",2
"nicht zu empfehlen, Touristenfalle","Clube de Fado - das klingt nach ein paar kalten Getränken und guter Musik. Leider ist es das nicht. Es handelt sich hier um ein Restaurant, das möge man beachten.
Unsere Nachfrage, ob es möglich sei, lediglich etwas zu trinken und die Musik zu genießen, wurde sofort vom Herrn am Empfang bejaht. Nachdem er uns dann schnell im Saal platzierte, fielen mir als erstes die schon auf dem Tisch stehenden und jämmerlich mit Folie abgedeckten Couverts auf. Diese bestanden aus recht trockenem Brot, irgendeiner Art von Fisch und Butter (ungekühlt!?) und alten Oliven. Allein das ist schon indiskutabel und nicht hygienisch. Schnell kam ein Kellner, wir bestellten eine Flasche Wein, die nie ankam und erklärten 20 Minuten später auf Nachfrage erneut, dass wir nicht zum Essen sondern zur Musik gekommen waren. Wir wurden dann sofort von zwei Personen, unter denen der Mann vom Empfang, unhöflich hinaus komplementiert.
Ich bewerte diesen vermeintlichen Club als Touristenfalle mit überheblichem und unfreundlichem Personal. Keinesfalls zu empfehlen.",1
See another fado show!,"Horrible food but ok music. No vegan options.
Advise anyone to see another fado show! The staff was rude and the manager unable to handle most simple tasks",1
Potential far from objective.,"A Club with enormous potential, but still far from achieving all its objectives, a very well set up reception, but with an entrance that is all abandoned, dark, with zero lighting.

Just go down the stairs and understand that what we pay is far from delivery and compared to good clubs around the world.

Gym with equipment in poor condition, old and dirty.

Old men's bathroom, dirty and very poorly maintained and installed.

Installation of the children's pool, depressing.

Kids Space, with broken, dirty toys, with zero structure for children. Just as positive and very well educated, the monitor who stays with the children.

WIFI does not exist! Something impossible, it simply doesn't work.

It can be seen from afar that good management goes a long way, unfortunately.

As I live opposite, I end up going there, as nothing good is nearby.

Something in such a noble part of the city of Lisbon, in this state, is unbelievable.

Potentially lost.",1
Thieves,"Do NOT give this gym your banking info. They love to scam expats. They will agree to cancel your membership and then keep debiting your account and then they will ignore you. Portugal is filled with great businesses and lovely people, but this gym is a vipers nest of pure scum.",1
Péssimo serviço,"Péssimo! Dizem que são um clube de excelência, mas depois o serviço que prestam é do mais baixo que existe.
As aulas de tenis são caras e más.",1
All in the sauce and faith in God,"We waited hours in line for a good place (there were 4 parallel queues), until the security team decided to make all the people in at once, generating a crowd trying to pass through the same door. It was so aggressive that there were no security reviews, if there were knives etc, in the premises... no one knows. There is no point in complaining because they blame people (customers).",2
Interesting building with very bad acoustic quality. Not acceptable for classic music performances,"We have listened to a performance of Nabucco of Giuseppe Verdi. The building is quite interesting. However the acoustic in the building is bad. Singers and orchestra sound was passed through amplifiers and loudspeakers of at best mediocre quality. Very, very disappointing. We had seats J2 and J4, which should be amongst the best.",2
Coliseu Recreios terrible experience,"Unbearable heat and uncomfortable chairs, the Coliseum does not offer the minimum conditions to see a show, only the ticket prices seem to be up to date given that the entire venue has stopped in time!",1
Coliseu despeça o engenheiro de som,Sei que por €30 para assentos laterais não me dá direitos a visão perfeita mas acho que me dá direito a ouvir a música para qual paguei. A pior experiência de som que jamais ouvi. Martinho da vila não merece rebaixar-se actuar em tão pobres condições. Jamais irei ao coliseu novamente,1
Disappointing Collette Experience,"The Collette tour of Portugal was my first with that company. My travel partner had never been with them before and she wanted to try them out. What a disappointment. We wanted to go in the fall of 2024 but they refused to tell us how many they could handle and how many openings there were. Friday after Thanksgiving rolls around and they had a special deal running. But when our travel advisor contacted them early in the morning there were no openings. I think they held out for a large group .
Then we went to the June trip and again they would not reveal any information to us.
We did not know how many until we arrived in Porto and found out there would be 39 on the trip. I never received an itinerary which is unheard of as of I have been on tours to 30 countries. We spent on day riding on a bus to various Catholic churches where we just walked ourselves around the inside and went back to the bus for the next church. We expected to see Roman ruins, Jewish sites, and information on the Moors
but did not. Food was disappointing. Choices were mainly lots of pork for lunch and dinner and then some fish.
I could go on but you get the picture and I would never go on another Collette tour again and do not recommend them.",1
Terrible TukTuk Tour!,Our experience was disappointing. Our driver was 1/2 an hour late. She did not know where we were supposed to go. We said the historic district. She was not very knowledgeable and did not give us the overview of the city. This was our first Tuk Tuk tour. I would not recommend this- I think a tour bus would have been better and more informative.,2
Compadre not Compassionate,"We were very disappointed that we had to end our trip to Lisbon due to an emergency. We were even more disappointed that Compadre Cooking School showed no compassion whatsoever and despite our rescheduled class being 2 weeks after we were forced to cancel, Compadre Cooking School had a “too bad, so sad, we’re keeping your money anyway” attitude. Personally, I wouldn’t choose to do business with anyone that lacks empathy and compassion. You shouldn’t either.",1
Disgusting and too bad I can't get a refund,"I came two days ago. I bought €60 worth of products. You should know that a box costs around €9 to €12. The octopus is absolutely disgusting. I'll let you go to the final point on the other side of the Tagus and you will taste quality for less money. In this store, you pay for marketing and not for quality and appetizer.",1
It’s empty!,Empty on Friday. Although the music is good the crowd is very unpleasant. We arrived early by 5 minutes but they refused to let us in although it was raining outside.,1
Bad online and face-to-face experience,"Those who take care of the profile of the disco should know how to deal with the public or at least have professionalism, since they supposedly exercise this profession.
They were holding a party where there was a stories informing about bracelets and I sent a message asking about and was blocked by the page profile.

Already at the club a good part of the team was rude not to say anything worse.
Environment totally unprepared to visit.",1
Avoid like the plague,"Absolutely horrendous place. Rude staff from door staff, security and bar staff. Stinks and looks dirty. Looks like it looks a very good cleaning and buckets of bleach. The bar staff treat you like they’re doing you a favour and gang up on you when you mention it. Absolute appalling.",1
I trash this place,"Very bad nightclub.. everything was of poor quality, the music, the dirt, the service! I'll never go back, plus it's very expensive for what it offers! Low level",1
Does not comply with official opening hours,"We would have liked to have visited, but we did not catch a single moment during a week of Lisbon during several attempts, when the museum would have been open! And this despite the fact that we had previously checked the homepage! At the main entrance there is a plaque with the opening hours, which says that is open daily with the exception of e.g. 25.12. and 1.1. There is expressly no mention of New Year's Eve there and yet we found the doors locked on 31.12.24 around 2 pm! We weren't the only ones who were puzzled by it. Very poorly organized!!",1
Disappointed,The church is famous because it has no roof then there is a small museum with archaeological finds 7 euros is the ticket price I was disappointed,2
Peu de choses à voir. Bof...,"Nous avons visité le covento do carmo lors de notre séjour. Il y a peu de choses à voir. Des colonnes au milieu des ruines de cette ancienne église qui avait été détruite lors du tremblement de Lisbonne. Attention il faut savoir qu'au moment de notre visite : Avril 2023, il y avait des travaux de rénovation avec des bâches ce qui ne permet des photos que sur une partie du monument. À l'intérieur quelques expositions de tombes et 2 momies péruviennes. On a eu l'impression de perdre notre temps. A moins d'être passionné d'archéologie je ne vois aucun intérêt à cette visite.",2
Décevant..,Nous sommes déçus de ce couvent car nous avons été surpris des travaux en cours en rentrant à l'intérieur.. (non signalé à l'accueil au moment de payer)... Les travaux prennent une bonne partie du couvent (celle que l'on voit d'ailleurs sur toute les photos sur internet..). Nous n'avons pas pu profiter de la beauté de ce lieu.. Dommage... Pensez à demander où en sont les travaux avant de le visiter !,2
Cancelled class,"Cooking Lisbon cannot be trusted. I booked a cooking class and then days before the class, Cooking Lisbon informed me the class had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Then on Monday, Cooking Lisbon informed me the class had been cancelled. I contacted Cooking Lisbon and was told that since I had not confirmed the class on Wednesday, the class had been cancelled. I informed Cooking Lisbon I had received an email stating my reservation for the class on Wednesday was confirmed. I asked why I needed to confirm the class when their email stated my reservation was confirmed. I also asked where in their email it stated I needed to confirm the class. Cooking Lisbon could not show it to me. So typical. Blame the customer. I had rearranged my visit to Lisbon so that I could take the class on Wednesday. I spent the next day contacting other cooking classes. I explained my situation that Cooking Lisbon had cancelled at the last moment and could they please add 1 more to their class. Unfortunately, they were all full. Some did say they were not surprised Cooking Lisbon had cancelled the class. Do yourself a favor. Find a more reliable and professional cooking class than Cooking Lisbon to avoid having your class cancelled.",1
Skip this one unless you are a meat lover and do this for fun,"I love to cook. I attended many cooking class and I was recommended this one by my client. They were a big group and had a lot of dishes.
I read that the class is not recommend for vegetarians. I believe we always find sth to eat. Our group was very small and I believe that is the reason why there were less dishes. To my surprise there were 2 chicken dishes. I left hungry even though there was an aperitif in the begining which I liked. Our chef Felipa was super friendly I just felt I did not learn really any cooking hacks. The kitchen was amazing. I hope everyone washed their hands before class…
I would skip this since I left hungry and really did not learn sth exciting.",2
Skip this one!,"Tour was a big disappointment. I have done many other cooking classes in other cities, and they usually give me a feel for the culture and people. This chef was uninspiring and had a flat affect. He was unable to illicit any energy from the group, was not engaging and mostly people stood around waiting. The wine was scarce with two bottles opened for 12- people. Had us stand around while one person fried literally 52 cod fritters (for 10 people). This took forever and most were not even touched. The sous chef just stood there and stared at us. Not sure he could speak English. The group was very friendly and nice but everyone was disappointed. Skip this one!",2
CHEF NO SHOWED,"The chef didn’t show up and we were not notified. We took an Uber across town, was left standing outside in the rain, and had to take an Uber back. It was our last day in Lisbon and a cooking class was a number one goal of our vacation. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING and poorly handled.",1
Disappointment,"I notified the company of my seafood allergy when I booked the event (months in advance). When I showed up, there was no acknowledgement of this. I gave the class a short, but I had to leave after 30 minutes. In the end, I wasted $80.",2
Cakes,"Very rude! They treat you like sheep. It is quite expensive compared to others right there.
I will not come back",2
I had food poisoning & vomited everything I ate from this class…,"I took numerous cooking class on & off for over a decade in US. They’re either cooking by yourself or 4 people in a group. As for this class, when there are approximately 20 people were involved & as for my sensitive GI, I have food poisoning. I was in an early flight next day & I emptied out my stomach by vomited 5 times. I had diarrhea 3 times after the flight & had dizziness throughout the day. NOT a great experience for me… My suggestion is instead of letting the people use their bare hands to mash the potato & picked the bones out from the codfish, it’s best to use disposable gloves or the kitchen tools such as potato masher & fish bone tweezer can get the job done. It’s much more hygiene than with their own hands.",2
Caution before booking if you have food restrictions,"I attended a cooking class at ""Cooking Lisbon"" with specific dietary requirements in mind (celiac disease), having communicated these needs in advance and received confirmation. Unfortunately, these requirements were not met on the day. When I addressed this with the instructor, her response was dismissive, suggesting that unless I had a severe reaction, it shouldn't be an issue.

Upon discussing my concerns with the manager post-class, I was met not only with skepticism but also with an inappropriate comment suggesting that people with my condition would only be seriously affected if they were to die from exposure. While the cooking class itself had potential to be enjoyable, the handling of dietary concerns and the subsequent interaction with management deeply affected my experience. For those with allergies or dietary needs, I'd advise caution before booking.",2
"Disappointed by the cost compared to the amount of participants, wouldn’t recommend this program in the currently format","12 people to complete 6 dishes on one working space. Not everyone got to work, there was no recipes and even in the download sent after not all the recipes were given.
It’s definitely an experience but more an introduction to the products they sell and having a taste of the different dishes.
Not worth the money spent to attend but if the asked half the price or included had half the participants I can imagine it is good.",2

Turned away paying customers,"Last night in Lisbon and this place came recommended by friends and we were excited to give it a try. Got to the establishment, rang the doorbell and a guy opened the curtains and door and asked us how many people. We mentioned 4 and he told us to come back in 30 minutes and drink at the bar next door -- what, who does that to paying guests? AND The place was empty!
Great way to turn away customers.
And that's exactly what we did, gave our business to 1868, a Great cocktail bar, very happening and welcoming and just up the street.",2
Tax-free procedures don't work.,"It's quite expensive compared to other similar cork shops, but it's attractive because there are items that you can use everyday, not souvenirs. He gave me a lot of explanations and advice while I was shopping. I chose the item with good feeling.
What surprised me was that I was denied tax-free procedures. He said he was too busy because he was alone, but there were no other customers. I think it's just a hassle because it's not in your best interest.
It seems that I make so much money at this store that I have time to brag about being jealous of everyone. Therefore, this assessment.",2
"Very small, very expensive, good quality but you can do better","I will never understand some of the reviews people give. One lady from Texas said she was overwhelmed with the selection. If you could spend more than 10 minutes in this store I'd be surprised. It is very small. No doubt good quality and certainly 1000% better than all the junk stores. However, they are overpriced. We did a lot of research before we came to Lisbon. We wound up getting better quality handbags at less than 50% of the cost at a market which was only open on Saturday and Sunday. The family of the lady we purchased them from actually makes the bag. Of note, the salesperson at Cork & Co. said they buy their products from individual makers as opposed to one source. BTW she was very helpful and nice.",2

We bought this ticket the day before the tour thinking we should not miss out on this beautiful monastery. However, after arriving at the monastery, there was a huge line (ticket holder) that took an hour to get to the entrance. When we got to the ticket check point, our vouchers did not work. I panicked but there were nobody who could help me. The staff almost sent us away but I decided to go ahead and purchase four more new tickets online right there right then (good thinking!). We went in and realized that there was no audio guide available. Wasted our money buying the entry tickets with audio guide. Once we were inside, we walked around the main Cloister. That was it. No access to the church unless you buy a separate entrance ticket and had to be at a certain open time. The architecture was beautiful but we were so frustrated by the experience with tickets. We came back to the US and contacted VIATOR requesting refund on unused vouchers but they absolutely did nothing to help me. Bad customer service.

The CP trains,"Lisbon Entrecampos to Loulé, Alfa Pendular in 1st class, with departure at 17.31h
Delay of 11m. at departure. It's not acceptable. I use trains in Europe, Germany and the Netherlands and punctuality is an honor.
Interior of the wagon in good condition although the container on the back of the chair that preceded me had dirty papers. Adequate air conditioning.
WC. A scandal of smell and dirt. The pest odor of urine is offensive to passengers.
And why this pest odor? It's only derived from the sanita to have a hole in ""open sky"" where the destroyers run. Imagine if the accumulate of bad smell that permanently come out through that hole
The planes have a suction system. And the CP, which is in the ink for passengers, and could replace these sanitas, keep this system, archaic, outdated and disgusting, no doubt.
The bar. A shame. The products presented appear to be of very low quality. The decomposition of the counter is sick. The service provided by the sole official is deplorable.
And besides all this, 25m late on arrival to Loulé.
A shame and a screaming lack of respect for the passengers. The CP administration has an obligation to go through what we go through on these trains. Get out of the cabinets and use these routes.

Comboios De Portugal is disappointing (Ticket buying experience),"So far the least favorite in this trip. Be sure to not make any mistake in buying your ticket at the ticket machine at Oriente. We bought 2 1st class tickets to Porto. Missed the train for 2 minutes so we went to the ticket counter and was told there’s nothing we could do. No return no exchange basically. However i went to the CP website and it says something different. I was also told by the conductor to talk to the ticket personnel at the Campanha, Porto and see if we could get a refund. We end up buying regular tickets because we want to see Porto. I’ll update with our experience in Campanha.",2
Heat exhaustion on Comboios de Portugal No train crew to be seen as passengers suffered,My Wife Sister in law and I traveled on an IC inter City train on May 29th Faro to Lisbon because of a need to a funeral. It was a very warm day. We traveled in the last car all three are seniors. An hour into the 3.5 hour trip the car began to overheat to the point that hand measurement showed temperature at close to 100F. Complaints were made to staff who told us that the train crew was aware but nothing wad done. The so called Air conditioning system did not work and no attempt was made to fix it or at least provide water to passengers. In the last hour of the trip several passengers began to suffer heat exhaustion. I LOVE TRAIN travel and this is the worst trip I have ever been on. The train crew was no where to be found. A number of passengers were endangered,1

Price and logistics reviews,"Criticism of CP – Trains of Portugal

I would like to express my dissatisfaction with the experience we had with CP. We organized a trip with a group of 47 children and 8 adults, having tried to book seats at Alfa Pendular from November 2024 to May 23, 2025. Despite the huge advance, we were never allowed to make the reservation.

In addition, CP’s advertising of “special prices for groups” proved completely misleading. Group tickets were more expensive than if purchased individually — for example, each adult paid €49.90, while the individual value would be €33. Instead of a discount, we had a price deterioration.

As if not enough, on the return, two of the seats reserved for our group were occupied by passengers who claimed to also have a ticket. As the revisor took more than an hour to show up, two people from our group had to travel standing during this time, thinking that CP had sold the same seats twice. Only then the revisor, who was attentive and efficient (without any fault because we were penultimate wagon), solved the situation.",1
Aggressive and Intimidating Treatment of Tourists – Avoid This Train Company,"We had an absolutely awful experience with Comboios de Portugal (CP) on the return train from Pinhão to Porto.

We had bought tickets for a later train, but after checking directly with the train driver, we were told it was fine to board an earlier service. Once the train had departed, the ticket inspector approached us and told us our tickets were invalid. When we explained that we had been told by a CP staff member that it was okay, he became aggressive and threatening.

He demanded we show ID. My husband had his passport, but I only had mine on my phone — which he refused to accept. He then threatened to call the police unless we paid him in cash on the spot. It was extremely intimidating and felt completely unfair. We were forced to pay just to avoid further distress.

We have video evidence of this encounter, and it left us feeling shaken and disgusted. We were two respectful tourists, acting in good faith, treated like criminals for a simple misunderstanding — one we even tried to clarify before boarding.

CP needs to take responsibility for its unprofessional, dishonest, and borderline abusive conduct. This kind of treatment of visitors is unacceptable. Based on our experience, I would strongly advise tourists to avoid travelling by train in Portugal unless you want to risk being ripped off or threatened.

Absolutely disgraceful.",1
Do not support!! Fake public company!!!!,"Do not use this company!! Much better alternatives both in RedeExpressos and Flixbus. There's absolutely no way for you to know if you will have your train or if the workers decide to stay at home, despite being over-payed by a lot considering what they do. Not last time, but last 5 or 6 times i needed to use the service one of the trains were down, or delayed (not 5min, like more than 1hour, always!)!! Besides all that, both bus companies have updated and upgraded their buses and they are way better than any cp train - at least they don't smell.

What made this place memorable: horrible!
Ease of booking and navigation: only for the rich that travel in expensive trains; others have to buy tickets in person!
Potential costs or wait times: extra expensive considering the quality and time spent and as for the time wasted it can be at least 1h to your train not even departing without any warning.",1

it is worth that companies so still has some employees who are 5 stars are only in the wrong place company so it does not give minimum for complaints should not have alvará to have business, better the state has no one to work to monitor companies and its ways the company policy is one thing the employee ruin towards a customer is another matter the part there should already be treated differently but ok lost a day of work may be that the company one day loses millions never knows future.

Even when they are not on strike, the trains are repeatedly delayed and clarifications are never given to users.
The company should pay for us to use terrible transport like CP.

Many Opportunities for Improvement,"There are so many things they could do better. On the IC, improve the numbering to clearly identify the car.

Washrooms with sinks that don't work. No soap, no paper towels or dryers that work. No place on the IC to store large suitcases. Only option is the overhead rack which doesn't work for older people with large heavy bags. Being government run, it's unlikely these things will improve.",2

So, on my trip, I asked what time the train arrived in Tunis... I also know that there is work on the line!
To which Mr Revisor, unlike his other colleagues who have always been impeccable, polite and helpful, replied rudely, in addition to an expression of boredom, that I wouldn't let him do his job, I had 400 passengers, who could have asked when I bought the ticket, at the ticket office (more than 8 days ago!, would you already know about possible delays at that time?)
I report this because I think it is unacceptable to be mistreated in public for politely asking the conductor of the train I am traveling on, what the timetable is!!!

Just be careful and look out for your own safety no one employed with CP is concerned for you.,1
Nice guide but waste of money,"We definitely wouldn't do this again!
Our tour guide was nice.
But it was definitely not worth the money spent.
We probably had completely wrong expectations.
The historical information about Portugal was very limited (on a 2-hour guided tour with walking gurus we learned about 10x as much)
The tour is limited to about three streets, that's all you can see from Lisbon.
You also don't get an insight into local manufacturers or insider tips with top products but visit normal restaurants and shops.
The food was okay but not great.
The second stop was a restaurant where there was a rice dish, after that we were pretty full.
Better spend your money on a cheaper historic city tour and at a few markets and good restaurants!",2
"Overbooked the tour, cancelled us. Ruined the last day of our holiday. No refund until after we get home. Almost £300","We booked this wine tasting for the last day of our holiday and paid in advance for 6 of us costing the best part of £300.

We were asked to change the time the day before and when I said we couldn’t we were told they were full and our booking was cancelled.

I now have to wait until we are home from holiday before I get the refund which means we can’t fund another activity.

Why are they not limiting ticket sales to a number that they can handle?

So disappointing",1
Nula,"Una vergüenza, una vez reservado y pagado me contactaron dos días antes de la reserva diciendo que no tenían disponibilidad y que cancelara la reserva. Una pena, me habría encantado conocer la bodega.",1
Poor poor poor service!,"Booked via booking.com

Did not get what I booked.

Booked an executive transfer and got a rude, obnoxious, tracksuit pant and t shirt wearing
lady who had no idea about customer service.

Was then fed into a crappy Renault (def not executive) and whisked away. These people should be involved with airport transfers as if this is how you enter a country, it leaves a re bad taste in one one’s mouth!",1
Disappointed. Our expectations of the bike lanes were unrealistic.,"Perhaps I’m looking at this from a slightly different perspective to those who have written glowing reports. We cycle regularly at home on cycle tracks, quiet country lanes and, if impossible to avoid, occasionally short sections in traffic. Our average for a trip is 30-50k. When we saw Lisbon had been developing their cycle lanes and was great for a cycle break, we were really pleased, and hoped for miles of unhindered cycling along the coast, as in Mediterranean France. We felt it would be a good way to explore but didn’t see any options to hire for several days at a time. So we just planned the one, to start with, a 56k return cycle along the coast to Cascais.
Well, it was stop-start all the way as far as we got. The bike tracks kept finishing, and were not particularly well signed, so we often had to backtrack. A railway line ran the length of our journey and sometimes, when the track suddenly ran out, we’d have to use tunnels to get under the railway and once we had to carry the heavy bikes up steps. As far as possible we avoided cycling on the (very) busy roads, but this meant cycling on the pavements, which were narrow at times. Finding it more stressful than relaxing, we gave up half way and turned round to come back. But we couldn’t find the cycle path and went for miles to try to find a way to get back across the railway line without using steps. We enjoyed the exercise and the bikes were excellent but thank goodness we only booked one day. I’d say it’s great if you only want to go 10k or so.",2
Disappointed,"Far too many people in August
Even with advance tickets
The queue was so huge that we were late on schedule and we were not allowed to go back
We could only make the gardens
Besides, we can no longer get in the car
So plan to be on Sintra at least 1.5 hours before schedule

We'll try to get a refund
Avoid tourist areas in August",2
Czech people no hello no thanks pay and shut up,"trip to Prague with e dreams it starts at the airport book a transfer 1 hour late the delay came 1 hour too early at once 3 hours to wait for our return flight, the 4 star hotel was worth only 2 stars had to pay an extra superior room to access the pool , bowling broke down tennis or rather a vacant lot , many faults answer of e dream when to refund had to see with the hotel while the hotel tells us that we are not the first not to be warned by e dreams of the extra costs I advise e dreams washes your hands of your problems just pockets the money and disappears...",1
Absolute horror tour,"All in all, not recommended. The only dramatic thing was the 6.5 hour journey in the coach, up and down mountains in the bus. There are no designated stopping points like the Skywalk, but you can get out every half hour, take 2 or 3 photos and get back on. The only thing that was good was the lunch. The views were great, but you couldn't let it sink in. And finally, after tasting the poncha, you had to wait another half hour in the bus because 2 people were going shopping. If you go on a western tour, you can only go by jeep.",1
Did not consider family situation.,"We paid 171 Euro through TUI for this trip. 90 minutes before the trip, our son got a migraine and we tried to reschedule. We contacted TUI who made several attempts to contact the boat operator. After getting no response for an hour, I went to the boat company stand in the Marina and told them the story of the sick child. They said that to cancel, TUI would have to ring them so we asked TUI to do this but still no joy. They offered us a chance to split the family and for two of us to go at the scheduled time and then reschedule for the other two but we were not going split the family on a family holiday. We spend the next two days trying to reschedule via TUI but the boat company came back and said that we would need a sick cert for our child to prove he had a migraine. We paid 171 Euro and got no trip. This seems very unfair from a customer point of view. This review is not about the trip itself but how we were treated by the company. There are other companies in the area that offer the same trip and we rebooked with them for a lot less.",1
So disappointing!,"We have taken food tours on every vacation and we have never been disappointed - until now! A totally, disappointing experience. Guide imparted very little useful information, constantly repeated himself, rushed us at 2/4 stops (after telling us there was no rush). He said he was a chef but provided almost no interesting information about the food or history. We have been in Portugal for 3 weeks and could have provided a much more detailed, interesting commentary. The food was also disappointing: one fried sausage croquette per person and tempura beans with a rum drink at stop 1, a very nice cheese board and chorizo at the second (the only nice stop) with one bottle of wine (for 6), and small bowl of average fish soup and a simple rice dish with 1 bottle of “homemade” wine at the third (again, for all 6 of us!) and a nata and small cup of port to finish - for $100 per person!!!! Reviewing the other food tours, they mostly provided more for less money. We spent at least 20 minutes at a viewpoint, but with almost no substantive discussion - mostly just standing around. We deserve a refund! Be forewarned - pick a different company!",2
The Tour Never Happened,I showed up - it was raining and no one was there. I showed up in advance and on time. There was no tour and no tour operator. I paid for nothing.,1
Lisbon is a fail,"This was a fail on a so many levels from this tour operator. From the lack of communication to the lack of support from the help desk - this experience was beyond disappointing.

We have been on a Devour Tour in the past and have enjoyed and recommended. On this occasion the meeting point was not accurate. The support team were not able to connect and let us know where we could find the group and at the end of it - we were left paying for something that we never received.

What we hoped was our highlight in Lisbon was such a disappointment. And we ended up paying for their lack of communication to their customer

My advice is that there are other tour operators that will value your business more than Devour Tours.

Sorry James. We used to be a fan.",1
Poor experience. Would not recommend,"Not impressed. Way overpriced for what you received. I wouldn't call this a food tour. One stop and dinner and a fado show. Fado show was what gave you the two rating. Could have booked the Fado show and dinner oirselces theiugh the jotel for free. Guide did not stay for the whole event and left us to find our own way back k via taxi or Uber at our own cost. Which was an added expense that was not expected.
This was not advertised in the group overview. Guide should have stayed with us and brought us back to the starting point at minimum. Booking a couple of Tuk Tuks to do so would have been helpful. Will not be re commending this tour.

.",2
Historical culinary tour of Lisbon,Agathe was an amazing guide! So knowledgeable and well informed. She was warm and made the tour both interesting and fun! Thank you!,2
Tourist trap,"Eva was a great guide but her company designed this experience as a fine collection of the worst tourist traps in the city. Book it if you want to experience gas station level food while you could stop at any random restaurant in the city and eat amazing. Make sure not to miss Solar do Kadete, where you will have codfish from a week ago, plastic french fries and diluted wine. Avoid like the plague",1
Poor Service!,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I accidentally booked the Sintra Palace Tour for the same day/time as this tour. I notified Devour Food Tour with 24hr+ time notice to cancel. They finally responded no refund and that I needed to contact Viator directly. Viator/Trip Advisor told me no refund. I simply would have rescheduled for the next day but no one would help me. Very disappointing after arranging my Lisbon hotel & tours through trip advisor. Eating the $156+ fee isn’t the point, it’s the lack of service and understanding during what is supposed to be a fun trip. Beware when booking.",1
Don’t do it.,"Disappointing- waste of time and money
We just did this two this morning and it was absolutely lack lustre. Inexperienced tour guide, disorganised, disjointed, poor food. The whole thing was poor quality from the design of the tour, the tour guide, and the food was cheap and all round just a waste. I am skeptical about the positive reviews previously on here and wonder if they are client paid. Shop around for better company to do this type of tour.",1
A theft,Theft. I paid 28 euros for ice cream. I've already paid half for better work. A theft. They even pay for the lime,1
Diana Tours buses do not run on time and has horrible customer service.,"Our hotel provided us a brochure regarding the Diana Tours bus schedule and we thought that it would be the perfect way to see Lisbon. The stop closest to our hotel was number 7 “The museum of Lisbon” on the Uptown line. We arrived at the stop at 16:25 PM to wait for the 16:35 bus. We waited over 40 minutes and the bus never came.

We walked back to our hotel and called the company at 17:14 pm asking what happened. They could not explain why the bus did not arrive but did tell us that another bus was coming at 17:35 pm and that we would be returning to our number 7 stop at 18:50 pm.

That did not happen. Our bus pulled into the last stop at 18:30 pm and we were told we had to get off the bus. We explained that we needed to get back to our number 7 stop and that’s when we were told again to get off the bus. I explained how we had spoken to the company and that we were to be returned to the number 7 stop and we had no way to get back. They said “you did not talk to me” and you need to take public transportation home.

So we were stranded miles away from our hotel and the Diana Tours company did nothing to help.",1
a day to forget,We chose the Lisbon tour with the KOMBO 2 lines option costing 28 euros which means that you can choose two out of 4 itineraries... we did the first which is in the central part and we reserved the right to do the wider one in the afternoon... ...you can get off and on whenever you want......SORRY THAT NO ONE WARNED US that on May 20th there would be a party for the city team and so everything was blocked...not even taxis could be found and we had to walk back......I don't recommend it...it's better to queue and take tram 28. IT COSTS MUCH LESS and is more beautiful,1
Advice re: hop on hop off bus,We booked the hop on hop off bus in Lisbon - 2 grayline tickets - from Diana tours kiosk at a cost of 58 euro from the kiosk at marquis de Pombal at the top of the Avenida de liberdade - avoid ! Go for the other bus company “city sightseeing” . We waited well over an hour on the red line ( they had promised one every 25 minutes) for a bus losing valuable time of our trip and meanwhile 4 of the other company’s buses stopped by. Would not use them again.,2
Bad experience,Sadly we had to get off the boat because it was rocky. The boat is fairly small and they pack in guests. The company refused to provide a refund. We advise not to trust this company and choose another. There are many other options available.,1
No communication from operator,The operator was unresponsive when trying to contact to set up logistics. No communication at all. You should reach out to the guests to let them know the details.,1
"Pay for ""free"" walking tour","Basically, the tour was a bust. We had booked a completely different tour but were ushered to take part in this one. The guide actually almost only used filling phrases and we didn't learn much about the city and its history. During the tour we made a few stops, one of them was to buy drinks off of the guide's ""grandma"" which seemed fake to us. What shocked us the most was that the tour was no free walking tour though advertised otherwise. The guide told us from the beginning that it would cost at least 12 euros per person at the end. In our view this does not comply with the concept of free tours and we cannot recommend the experience.",1
"Worst experience ever, total tourist scam!","Foi vendido que seriam 5 bares e foram só 3.
O primeiro bar era horrível, pequeno, fedido, sujo e o shot era uma bebida muito duvidosa e o copo de shot é minúsculo.
o segundo teve 1 hora de open bar, a cerveja Heineken tinha gosto de super bock, a super bock tinha gosto de Heineken, mas suspeito q seja tudo sagres da pior qualidade.
O terceiro pra ter o shot ""grátis"" tinha de pagar por qualquer bebida, pedi uma tequila e tinha mais água naquilo do que Tequila.
Por todos o bares foi dinheiro jogado fora, cata turista total.
A balada no final é boa, mas quase não entrei por causa do dress code que nunca foi falado em momento nenhum no anúncio, tive de ""alugar"" uma casaco flanelado de um turista QQ por 10 euros pra usar e passar pela segurança.

Não recomendo a ninguém, pegue seu dinheiro e ande pelas ruas e bares de Lisboa, terá uma experiência imensamente melhor.

English, please read!
It was sold that there would be 5 bars and there were only 3. The first bar was horrible, small, stinky, dirty and the shot was a very questionable drink and the shot glass is tiny. the second had 1 hour of open bar, the Heineken beer tasted like super bock, the super bock tasted like Heineken, but I suspect it's all Sagres (Portuguese beer) of the worst quality. The third one to get the ""free"" shot I had to pay for any other drink, I ordered a tequila and there was more water in it than Tequila. Money was thrown away all over the bars, total tourists scam. The party at the end is good, but I almost didn't go in because of the dress code that was never mentioned in the advertisement, I had to ""rent"" a flannel coat from a tourist in the entrance for 10 euros to wear and get through security. I don't recommend it to anyone, take your money and walk through the streets and bars of Lisbon, you will have an immensely better experience.",1
Not worth the price,"This wasn’t what I expected. I didn’t realize our guide and other people who purchased the tickets would be having dinner with us. It was very expensive for what was offered: bread, cheese, olives, chorizo, and cod cakes. They charge for water. 8 of us were crammed into a very small space, in a very small restaurant. The guide was very nice but this experience was not worth the price.",1
No guide present,"No guide at meeting point! Fortunately for us we were able to join a tour run by another company. It was very good
We won't use Discover Lisbon again",1
Boring.,"Boring, lacking dynamics, and mix many ages, and not the same party for a 20 q for a 40...much better",1
Unfortunate and not professional,"We showed up at the meeting point of our reservation at 10.00h and it turns out that there was NO TOUR IN SPANISH without warning, without cancellation, with no other option. Disappointing and no refund of booking payment. Playing with customers' time like this seems unfortunate",1
The statues are clear.,I was feeling bad. I could not come. I asked if I could come the next day. That was not possible. I asked once again. It was policy....,2
Waste of money and time,Waste of money and time no club I paid for club but club is closed I don’t want to recommend this place any one because of lie with us,1
Not on my list of things to recommend,"The music was nice the location good and tour guide ,Muhammad, was excellent but, perhaps because I don't understand the language I didn't get it. 2 hours was way too long for the tour. In my opinion it's not worth paying for this tour, I heard beautiful Fado singers while I was walking thru the town. This not a tour I would recommend",2
Sangria is jungle juice.,"Guides did nothing. The “1 hour open bar sangria” is Fanta, sprite, grenadine and vodka. The last club refused to let me and the 10 others I was with in, for no apparent reason and asked if I was deaf (I am partially) and the guides did nothing to help. Nonetheless two stars because we met some fun people! Wouldn’t recommend though. This bar crawl ruins lives.",2
Avoid this tour!,"This tour was a total disappointment. We started a half hour late, walked 2 blocks to a “Fado restaurant “, so not a tour. The restaurant sat us in a different room from where the Faso musician’s were performing. We couldn’t hear or see the show, the single class of cheap wine was a 4 oz pour (charged $10 for additional 4 oz pours). The “tapa’s” consisted of a few wedges of stale cheese. And worst of all, our guide knew nothing about the history of Fado, was reading an explanation of it of his phone. I wrote to the tour company asking for a refund and never heard back from them. I was so annoyed/angry I left early. Terrible experience!",1
Nothing more...,"Group too large, first bar on top! 2nd bar, sangria not good and if you don't like beer the rest at your expense. The 3rd bar which was more of a discotheque, not very small, simple music, not a real discotheque. I expected better and more discovery",1
Very underwhelming compared to other tour companies around,"Although the tour guide was nice, the information provided was presented in a very dry manner and seemed completely rehearsed with no spontaneity. It didn't help that the tour started off poorly when the guide started her presentation right next a religious demonstration blasting music on the square. Instead of moving to a different spot before starting, multiple people had to ask her to move because no one could hear a word she was saying. There was a real disconnect between the guide wanting to deliver her information and making the tour a pleasant experience for the group.

All in all, I find this tour company is poorly run. We also did a tapas food tour with the same company the next night, hoping for a different experience. Unfortunately, we also had an underwhelming experience with that one. I don't think this company takes any feedback seriously and will continue to offer the same tours because there will always be a high demand for this kind of tour. I would highly recommend taking a tour with Hi Lisbon instead. We were blown away with the difference with that tour company.",1
Not as described. You're better off going to a restaurant on your own.,"We were excited for this tapas tour based on the description on their website and by previous reviews on Tripadvisor. Unfortunately, the tour seems to have changed in the last little while even though the website hasn't updated the information. The ""tour"" is now at a single restaurant where neither the guide nor the restaurant staff provided any information on the dishes and the wine. It wasn't until we specifically asked the tour guide for a description that he decided to talk a bit about what was in front of us. It was incredibly underwhelming and we definitely regret joining this tour for 35 Euros. We also did a free walking tour with Discover Lisbon the day before which was also underwhelming. I don't think this tour company looks to improve their service and are simply cashing in on their offerings.",1
Avoid Food Walking Tour,"Avoid the Tapas ‘Walking’ Tour. We were under the impression we’d hop between multiple restaurants for multiple wine and tapas tastings. Nope: we were brought to ONE restaurant, immediately poured 3 glasses of wine, and given 3 tiny tapas dishes to share. The guide didn’t explain anything we were eating or drinking, and barely spoke throughout the meal. We basically paid 35 euro each for someone to make a restaurant reservation for us to eat with a bunch of strangers, at a restaurant we’d never have otherwise chosen. Incredibly disappointing.",1
You Get What You Pay For,"This is free tour, so ""you get what you pay for"". We did get an overview of some sights in Alfma neighborhood, however, the guide was not well informed. For example, she pointed at the train station and said, ""There is the train station. It's very old."" That was it. 🤷‍♀️
Many people on the tour weren't even listening and were just chatting amongst themselves the whole time. So if you really want to learn about things in Lisbon, do another tour.",2
Horrible bars and guides,Not the best. Empty bars and “clubs.” Horrible alcohol. The tour guides were creepy and weird. They weren’t very friendly and a tad rude and offensive.,2
Bad value - Better to DIY Pub Crawl,"Pretty shithouse. Don’t expect to get your money’s worth from drinks. They split up the group a little bit too much, definitely killed the initial vibe.",1
Disappointing and not as advertised.,"Disappointing experience compared to other Pub Crawls we've been to. I paid for extra for ""premium"" option for all you can drink gin, vodka, sangria and beer in one hour. But the bar they took us to did not serve sangria and first refused to serve us gin. Also, too much time was spent on the first bar with only one shot included.",2
30€ für 3 Locations 😍,"Was soll ich sagen, ich habe die Tour nach 1,5 Stunden und bei dem Besuch im ersten Lokal abgebrochen. Es gab ein frei Shot und nach ca. 60 Minuten habe ich dann mal gefragt, was wir noch vorhaben. Der Guide sagte wir besuchen 3 Lokale in 4 Stunden. Das heißt man bekommt 3 Freigetränke für 30€ pro Person (war ein Samstag). Das hat absolut nichts mit einer Kneipentour zutun. Pub Crawls habe ich schon mehrfach besucht aber das war mit Abstand der schlechteste. Die Guides sind angestellt und arbeiten nach Vorgabe vom Chef. Also Sie können nichts dafür.",1
"Se o seu objetivo for ser ignorado e tratado como um lixo na porta de um club, venha, caso contrário fiquem longe disto.","Tudo começou bem, mas quando chegámos na hora do Club, eu e um grupo de outras pessoas fomos deixados do lado de fora, a ver navios. Os guias, que supostamente deviam nos ajudar, não só desapareceram, como começaram a recusar qualquer tentativa de contato.",1
"Avoid, just go out to dinner","Our guide Ricardo was lovely, but the experience was not. A reminder for what’s listed in the description - you go to ONE restaurant, so it is not a tour as you might assume. You get 3 pathetic tapas, and one took so long to come out that we left (after a party of 4 had already left 15 minutes before) because even if the sardine we were promised finally showed up, we were still going to be hungry. (Which does make sense - this is advertised as tapas, not a whole meal, and not enough tapas to constitute a meal - so our bad for not thinking that through.)

Of the 2 tapas we stayed for, the codfish (a Portuguese staple that I was quite exited to try) was just a fried potato ball with an undetectable bit of fish inside; the “cooked at your table” chorizo was decent but literally just a few slices of chorizo; and the bread we received to eat with it was extremely stale.

We met in Baixa-Chiado and walked 25 minutes to Alfama for the restaurant… why???? Why didn’t we just meet at the restaurant? Who knows. The tour guide didn’t even know because he didn’t plan it, he took over for someone else, so not great internal communication. It would have been nice to have some history/city info on our walk, but that didn’t happen.

The restaurant we went to has very mediocre reviews. I’m sure it’s not easy to find a place that will host 15 people but maybe just make the experience capacity smaller and go to a nicer place.

The food was sad. The wine was sad. The view was ok. If you wanted water, it counted as one of your 3 glasses of wine.

We got a pastéis de nata before we started walking, so I guess I can check off dessert even though it happened first?? It was the best part of the night.

The ginjinha that I paid extra for? Nowhere in sight. The fado that other reviews talk about? Nope, not here.

Lotta false advertising. Avoid this “experience” whether you see it on Eventbrite or TripAdvisor or somewhere else. I paid ~$75 for 2 people to have 3 bites of food, a couple glasses of wine and some water - oh and delicious dessert but as our appetizer. If you get Ricardo on any of their other tours/experience, you will have a great time! But don’t waste your money on this.",1
"Disappointing, too crowded, couldn’t see the singers","We were placed in a side room that was too crowded for the group. The singers did not want to sit Ny there after the first two songs. They sang in the main room and we could hear them but not see them unless we stood up and went into the other room. And that room was crowded too so there was not much space to stand.
Overall, very disappointing.",2
Non-existing tours,"I'm not sure how nobody mentioned this in the comments. I read on the website that Discover Lisbon offers several free walking tours and decided to join the downtown tour which was supposed to start at the Rossio square at 11AM. When I got there, I was told by the guides that the downtown tour doesn't exist and that they only have an Alfama tour. The downtown tour was supposed to go through Chiado, Baixa etc., so, another part of the city. Finally they told me that none of the tours advertised on the website don't exist (except the Alfama tour) and instructed me to talk to their manager who happened to be there. When I told him about that, he tried to convince me that such tour is not advertised on their website! He also told me that I have to book a tour via their website if I want to join the tour - which is also not possible via their website. Anyway, if you want to join the Alfama tour, go ahead (though it's unclear to me how you are supposed to book it), but if you aim for another tour, it doesn't exist, don't even bother.",1
Non buttate i soldi,"Il Peggior pub crawl della mia vita noioso, disorganizzato,non fai niente..20euro buttati lasciate perdere fatevi un giro al Barrio che trovate locali più belli e divertenti",1
Poor choice of bars,"Me and my friends did the bar crawl on Thursday night of 2nd of March. Met some cool people. The first bar was quite mediocre, very crowded and with problems of getting drinks that we wanted. The club was good tho.
The next day we decided to give it another shot. Same bar was so called open bar and with even bigger crowd we got the same issues.
The guides were quite good, you could see that some of them were quite experienced, some less. But for sure good people.
Overall not bad, but there are things to improve.",2
"Don't bother, not as described","Tour description at time of booking: a tasting tour through Lisbon...walk through the historic neighborhoods and sample various small plates and local drinks at three PT restaurants...compare the flavors from various parts of the country, etc., then cap off the tour with a tasty pastry...WRONG. A 5-minute walk from point of departure to a single only restaurant does not constitute a tour. The three restaurants listed when we booked has since been changed to only one restaurant (very likely because our guide took a picture of the original description from my phone, plus he had never heard of Tripadvisor...), nor was there any pastry to cap off. Yes, we saw some Fado, which was not mentioned in the description at all, and is not for everyone. Tapas was okay, wine so-so. None of it worth the price. Needless to say this was way off base from what we booked. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1
Not good,Only went to one location despite the ad saying 3 locations. Tapas were terrible. Don’t waste your time or money.,1
Para no repetir.,"Visita turística en Español por Alfama a las 11;00. Español pésimo. Poquísima información, mal explicado.
No se puede vender un free tour en Español con este nivel.",1
Disappointed,"Our driver was very polite and the trip was well prepared as far as time and destinations but he was not knowledgeable about Fátima at all. He said the two brothers and their cousin saw the apparition. It was Lucia and her cousins Lucinta and Francisco that Our Lady appeared.
He made reference that you could make a wish there, not pray for special intentions. He obviously knew nothing of Fatima or the Catholic faith.
I was very disappointed with the tour and his lack of reverence at a most holy location",2
AVOID this Company,"No confirmation email was sent to us the day prior to advise of pick up time. We spent hours trying to get information and were eventually advised that the pickup time would be 0745 the next morning. Nobody showed up to pick us up on the morning of the tour, and after again contacting the tour company, we were finally picked up at 0835. We were given the last 2 seats in a small mini van, both of us seated in the front row with the driver. My daughter had to sit sideways for the duration of the tour with her legs on top of mine due to the stick shift control column which left no room for her legs and feet.

At each location on the tour, we were simply dropped off to wander around on our own and given a pick up time to meet the driver. A 2 minute explanation was given about the history of Fátima and that was the extent of the information provided. It was really just the equivalent of taking a very crowded taxi from place to place. Not really a tour at all.

The tour company did finally send an email confirming our pickup time the day after we had completed the tour, which was useless information at that point.

I have taken a great many tours in my travels over the years, and this was by far the most disorganized, and uninformative tour I have ever experienced.",1
"Stay away, you life is more important","On the way up, something happened. The van fishtail. We all panicked in the van. Driver pulled over to see if we were OK. Physically fine, but scared. Driver told us it, was a issue with the steering wheel. The van had over 400k and the company was aware of the issue and planned to sell it. Great company allowed us to get in a faulty van. We get to Fatima, 2 ladies stay in the van. We were told one of them has to eat. At the end of the time, back at the van. We don't see the 2 ladies. We were told one was hurt. He drove them to a taxi to go back to the hotel. They will take the tour on Monday. We all expected someone to call and check in with all.passengers. Monday I call the company, to let them know about our issue. Spoke to a man, telling g me that they are investigating the trouble. They have called the hotel and left messages for us all. No one got any massage. I told him it would be great customer service to check in and do something for us. He said, basically since we were ok to continue the tour. Than it is our problem, we should have asked to go back to the hotel also. That we could redo the tour on Wednesday. So basically since we were nice people the 5 of us got screwed over. Not even an apology. The driver also gave them a different version of what happened. Not worth it. Stay away from this company.",1

Along the way we were told by several officers that we could not go to Peña because there was an increased risk of forest fires. We ended up having to buy new tickets to enter Regaleira. And we were also unable to use our tickets for Peña due to the fire hazard.
Unfortunately, tiqets.nl does not understand that it would be polite to warn about these dangers. They apparently consider profit more important than customer safety! Spent €163.00 for which we get nothing but annoyance in return. Customer service only has some standard automated responses.",1
horrible,"Visit the Palacio de la pena horrible. It was the second time we went to this palacio. But this time, visit at fixed times because many people and there it was horror, organization, endless visit with queues in the rooms, the cloister, a horror. why bring people in these conditions including limit security",1
Very disappointed with the service,"We never went, because we mistakenly put the wrong date. I tried to cancel and reschedule, but no luck. The tour agent was very short and could not offer any other solutions. We lost 100% of our payment. Very dissatisfying. Terrible customer service.",1
Pessima organizzazione,"Pessima organizzazione, anche avendo acquistato i biglietti online giorni prima fanno fare una lunga coda per accedere al parco. Una volta dentro altra coda per entrare nel castello pur essendo scritto che si poteva entrare 30 minuti prima. Se lo avessero detto si poteva visitare il parco più a lungo",1
Brazilian worker poorly educated and rude with clients,"I was in this store yesterday - on 03/05 around 8:30am and watched the Brazilian employee being poorly polite with the customers, including me, but what left me most sad was to see her being rude with an elderly!",1
ROBBED BY SECURITY,"I landed up getting robbed inside the club by the security guards and his friends partying inside. I do not recommend going to this place.

Awful,"They have an awful card system, they have a card and charge you if you lose the card. Please be aware if you are a man, they will let women in for free but charge men… for no reason.",1
Don’t go,"Terrible!! Don’t go unless you want to be turned away for no apparent reason. The security at the door is on a power trip. The security guard needs to lose his job. Racism, homophobia.",1
Average,"Average music, lots of girls paid for their attendance.
Additionally, when we paid for a square with bottle, we moved the tables 1 meter to have room for our legs, something the staff did not accept and blamed us for.
If you are in a wheelchair you will have to get up to get space.
Frankly average, have 1 meter of distance from your friends to have fun, plan walkie talkies",1
Do not go,"No unpleasant staff, disastrous square, we are all squeezed, we pay for bottles and we get yelled at because we moved one of the two tables 30cm, whatever, don't go there, if you want to have fun go to the k urban beach which is 500m from this club the music is good here",1
Security guards armed with people,"Security judges whether it's funny on the Instagram page with guess entry was €10
We arrived and they decided to charge us 1500 each because we were black

That is until the day they get smart with someone crazier than them
Horrible club, I don't recommend it",1
Evitem esse lugar,"São racistas e xenofóbicos. Evitem a todo custo.

Péssimo,"Nunca na minha vida me senti tão mal como eu senti aí, são racistas, e escolhem a vista quem q vai entrar. Tanto gerente e seguranças super mal educados. Lixo lixo lixo.",1
Really bad,Terrible Terrible Tribble! Bouncers are not very welcoming and extremely rude. Brits avoid this club at all cost as you would regret ever going there.,1
Negative experience,"I did end up buying antique tiles. The guy at the store was really rude and condescending. Basically told me I should go to museums and learn about Portuguese history when I asked him a question about tiles and some historical context. Be nice to your customers.
Very off-putting attitude.",1
Were not served or greeted. Left without beer.,"Dar Herr behind the bar found it not necessary to greet us, let alone for us to end his video call to serve us. Got up again after 5 minutes and also left without words. Beer looked great but could not be tasted.",1
The owner is arrogant and not friendly,"I had the worst experience of my 2 years living in Lisbon. I was waiting outside for this place to open to the public, and the owner who opened the bar/restaurant, was extremely aggressivel and vocal. He told me that the outside table belongs to the bar and I couldn’t sit there. I tried to explain to him that I was waiting for a friend who was going to sing in his restaurant. With an unprofessional attitude he told me that she is not the owner of the place. I kindly asked him if I could stay sitting there, or should I sit on the calcada do duque stairs? He told me (with his same attitude), whatever I wanted. There were people around who were also sitting at the other tables. Aggressively he told me that I was ignoring him. For me, our conversation had ended the moment he told me “whatever you want.” He told me that I wasn’t welcome there and I should leave. It was my first time there, and I haven’t tried his food, but because of the way I was treated with such disrespect, I don’t recommend this place and will never go there again. There are so many choices for places at the escadaria do duque, where you are treated better than this. Therefore, I don’t recommend this place!",1
This town has better,Our family made a reservation days in advance and when we arrived we were told we did not have a reservation and then showed email proof and were told to wait 30 mins which turned unit 45. Then were given a two person table for 4 people and judged for asking for one of the bigger tables when it was empty at 10pm. Overall service abysmal and were made very uncomfortable by the staff for what we believed were very basic accommodations. It was very clear the locals were prioritized… shrimp were not deveined and were not “fried”,1
Worst experience ever,"We paid in advance, the tour guide never showed up. We waited for an hour in the heat. We called him and he answered the first time he said he will be 10 mins late. But he never arrived and stopped answering the phone. Such a scam!",1
Biggest waste of money,Biggest waste of money. Thought we were actually stopping at the top tourist spots just to peek in but we didn’t. Food was just ok. Would never do it again.,1
Overpriced for What You Get,"We recently joined this food tour as a group of 9 (5 adults and 4 kids). While we really enjoyed learning about the Moorish neighborhood and appreciated the warmth and knowledge of our guide Fred, we left the experience feeling disappointed with the overall value.

The historical insights were engaging, and the guide did a good job of keeping things informative and kid-friendly. However, for a tour priced at $130 per person, the food and drink offerings felt underwhelming. Most of the stops were at very inexpensive street-food-style spots, and based on our experience, the total cost of food and drinks likely didn’t exceed 30 euros per person. In fact, when I asked for a coffee during the tour, I was told it wasn’t included ; which, at this price point, felt a bit off.

The tour was advertised as 3.5 hours, but it seemed we skipped the final stop and wrapped things up early, which added to the feeling that the experience was rushed and overpriced.

For context, this was the fifth walking food tour I’ve booked through TripAdvisor. The previous four were outstanding ; full of variety, generous tastings, and memorable stops — and were all priced between $60–$80 per person, even in more expensive cities. Given that this tour was double the price in a more affordable destination, it was hard not to feel let down.

That said, the guide was lovely, and we did walk away having learned some new things about the area. With a price adjustment and more generous food stops, this tour could be a great experience. I hope this feedback is helpful for both the company and future travelers",2
Overrated ‘food’ tour,Extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food given. Amount of information around the food was no more than basic.,2
Way too expensive for what it offers,A decent food tour but it’s way too expensive for what it offers. It’s specifically designed for clueless tourists with good disposable income.,2
not worth it,"poor value for the money, poor selection of restaurants, one was positively bad, these were not the best restaurants in lisbon, didn't get enough food",1
Our tour was canceled at the last minute.,"Three hours before our the scheduled start of our tour we received a text saying that our tour was canceled. We were offered other times on other days or a refund. That didn’t work for us.
The second ‘dot’ on my rating is because our refund was promptly processed.",2
Very disappointing and very overpriced,"The food was mediocre at best--easily the worst ""meal"" we had in Lisbon and the host was pretty annoying. It is hard to believe that Trip Advisor claims that 99% of respondents ""liked"" this event.",2
Very poor food choice and wine and no food expert showing me around.,"Food tour and wine tasting for price off the tour was not acceptable.

We offered cafe food and no explanation off the food and wine and origins.

We brought too Brazilian restaurant taste Brazilian food on Portuguese trip.

The food so minium that had eat after the trip.

The speaker we had was nice girl and she only do her Job but has no food experience.

This was food tour we didn't taste best porgueese cuisine or taste the beautiful wine be shown around.

I love my food and review all over and not food expert but If leave researching on phone about dishes.

We had sandwich halved for one meal bifana not Sandwich each.

The tour refused too give back refund.

This tour took 3 half hours off day for 180 euros.

This alot money for anyone now too not get best experience come out full out of it.",1
"Wont allow singles to book tour, 2 person minimum","I was excited about this tour after reading the amazing reviews.
As a solo traveler, this seemed to be a perfect way to learn about the culture and food, and possibly meet new people. Unfortunately, while I was able to book for one person, I quickly received a refund and an email stating that there is a two-person minimum and I would not be allowed on the tour. When I questioned this policy, I did not receive any rationale. Very disappointed.",1
Worst massage I have ever experienced.,"If you value yourself, go somewhere. I wish I can experience what I went thought. All I can say is that the place is Very dirty to get massage.",1
“Relaxing massage”,"Ana broke my shoulders i was in pain all day, my friends said they feel relaxed but i felt like i was getting Punished………..",2
Rescheduled without notifying,"Hey everyone, I booked a session over their website but when I arrived there with 15minutes in advance they told me that they rebooked my session for 4 hours later. They didn't contacted me for this changes. In other words they gave it to someone else.",1
Most Painful Massage of My Life,"I booked a 2 hour massage after reading so many wonderful reviews and after 2 weeks of traveling, I was more than ready for a massage. The receptionist asked what pressure I’d like and I said medium - so she suggested the EcoMassage.

Now I’ve been getting massages regularly for years, but this particular massage was by far the worst one I’ve ever had. My massage therapist was so sweet and kept checking in on me in terms of pressure. I kept telling her less pressure, but she kept going so deep that at some point I was seeing stars and thought I was going to pass out. I was in so much pain and told her that, but she said “no, I have to work” and kept going. I literally almost jumped off the table and walked out.

But I stayed, hoping maybe I was just super sore from all my travels and that I’d feel the benefit of it the next day.

Sleeping was extremely uncomfortable and waking up the next day, I am in physical pain. I feel like I’m bruised from head to toe, the pain is radiating on every part of my body. I can’t move without wincing in pain. I feel like I’ve been in a serious car crash.

If this is what their “medium” pressure is, I’d probably DIE with the deep tissue massage.

All this to say, I wish I had been more forceful in advocating for myself and my body. I am in severe pain that will likely impact my ability to enjoy my limited time in Lisbon. Simple movements are beyond painful.

The staff was extremely friendly and the atmosphere was great. I will say that! But this particular massage was not at all the relaxing, rejuvenating massage I had hoped for.",2
overrated Lisbon,"Very disapointing the hotel was very nice it was a locke hotel converted from a old nunnery . The city itself was dirty and rundown looking the locals not too friendly . The pastrys are amazing but the seafood is awful they like old salted cod from the North Atlantic rather than fresh local seafood . Even the touristry areas were rundown looking, Sintra palace was actually big old house poorly kept built really not that long ago . And what the tour guides said was the Portugueese Riviera Cais Cais was a a run of the mill beach town not really exciting Skip Portugal I was very disappointed and would not recommend",2
Horrible experience,"We were a group of 15 people and were divided into 3 tuk tuk. Unfortunately, the trip was ruined quite directly in the tuk tuk that Catalina drove. She was very upset because we spoke Swedish back there. Already after 2 minutes of the trip she refused to say anything and those who rode in her tuk tuk did not hear any guidance at all. Not for the whole tour. We then asked the guy who drove first to stay a little longer at the first viewpoint because our customers we had with us found it uncomfortable to ride in her tuk tuk. We then ended the tour early. When they dropped us off Catalina pointed her finger and shouted something at us when she left. Very unpleasant! The guy and the other girl who was driving were great but unfortunately Catalina ruined the trip for all of us.",1
A jarring city tour,"An hour and a half bouncing on cobblestones with many ditches through the town, a bit for the body, even without any prior back pain. Panoramic use, but other than that was provided only minimal information about the city.",2
Not a customer or family friendly business,"Eco Tours was the low point of an otherwise fantastic visit to Lisbon. After realizing just how hilly the city was, we took a quick (non Eco Tours) tuk tuk ride up to Castelo de Sao Jorge. My kids (7&5) were obsessed with the ride, so I quickly moved to book a full tuk tuk tour from Eco Tours via Trip Advisor. Eco Tours was easy to book via the app and I thought we were set to go for a 3-hour tour to Belem that evening. When we arrived, the driver informed us he only had one kid's booster seat and he'd need 2 to accomodate us. We waited while he checked to see if other drivers had one; however he came back empty handed and advised, no children allowed on tuk tuks he can't take us. Imagine my surprise, since we had in fact RIDDEN A TUK TUK 2 HOURS EARLIER.

As my disappointed children cried on the street, my mother tried to appease them with ice cream, and my husband secured us an alternate tuk tuk tour from a different company (yes, kids allowed without question). Amidst the chaos, I was told by Eco Tours via whatsapp chat that they have a policy of no children which is indicated on their website. Of course, I booked via the Trip Advisor app so I was not privvy to the no children, no families policy when I paid for my +$200 non-refundable trip.

While I accept, and also acknowledged to the customer service rep, that I surely signed a fine-print waiver agreeing to this and other rules when I authorized Eco Tours to charge me for the trip, I made a mistake that cost me unnecessarily. The bottom line is, we didn't get to take the tour. The tour guide didn't have to spend his time, no one spent money on fuel, and ultimately, my family was the only party who lost out (money and time... and lasting emotion strife after 2 international, jet-lag fueled meltdowns from my inconsolable kids :x ). I expect that a customer-centric tourism company would acknowledge that I didn't cause them any problem, and simply refund me, no harm no foul. Not so, instead, they passed me off to automated phone and email boxes to seek a partial refund despite ""the firm no-refunds"" policy. I did receive a partial refund for the tour that I didn't take....so including the consolation tour I booked, we spent a hell of a lot of money on tuk tuk adventures in Lisbon and learned that Eco Tours Lisboa is a business that I will NOT recommend.",2
Did not see much of anything,"Becareful of a tour guide by the name of Bruno, we were cheated the two hours as he stayed in one area the entire time. He told us that the schedule picked online isn’t available and that he will take us around the town. But for the entire two hours we really that we could have just walked around. This was rubbery.",1
Overpriced tour,We weren’t able to do the itinerary listed in trip advisor as he said it was too busy in the old city. Therefore we didn’t see the historical sites. He also said tuktuks were restricted in some areas. Extremely over priced for what we were able to see on the trip. Guide was named Bruno and he didn’t provide much details or information about the city. He took us to a view point that was littered in trash and didn’t even have a view of the river. Very disappointed.,1
Rough Ride,Really rough ride around cobblestone streets Our driver Carlos was late meeting us and seemed drunk or stoned or maybe just strange . His discussion of the city was disjointed and at times senseless. He spent a lot of time fighting/yelling at other drivers . Maybe with another driver it might have been a better experience,2
Good tour but better book onsite with a guide you choose,"Even though we had requested a French-speaking guide, the guide did not have an adequate command of French which made the visit very difficult to understand and enjoy.",2
Tuk Tuk Tour through Lisbon,"Our tour guide Simao was great, he showed us a lot and explained a lot. Thank you very much.
The rest all went wrong!!!
The tour was charged twice to my credit card. We had booked at 2 p.m., the day before I received a WhatsApp for the time at 10 a.m./2 p.m., even though we hadn't booked for 10 a.m. We were at the Hard Rock Café at 10 a.m., unfortunately no one came, another guide had told us that the German guide had already been booked. I still haven't received the money (188 euros) back, nobody cares!!!!",2
Uncomfortable,Bumpy less than 3hr ride. Driver was pleasant and knowledgeable but unfortunately we were uncomfortable the entire time. A bit of a rip off honestly and Viator is not accountable at all. If you have any back issues or are tall look elsewhere. Not worth the high rate.,2
Not Worth It.,"I took the “Follow the 28” tour with EcoTuks. The guide that I had said very little and seemed almost disinterested. He pointed out neighborhoods and sights, but said almost nothing about them. He disn’t say anything about the history, culture , or who currently lives in the areas we passed. Everything I learned about the area/sites was learned from taking a walking tour afterwards.

My guide with EcoTuks was less the expert guide and wealth of local knowledge that I hoped for, and more glorified transit operator. I hope this isn’t the normal EcoTuks experience, but my advice based on my experience; Don’t Waste your Money.",2
Not a pleasant experience.,"Very, very bumpy (ladies be sure to wear a sports bra). Traffic noise so loud could not hear the drivers explanation of sights along the way. Had to tell the driver to slow down and take me back to the hotel early.",1
Discrimination,"They won’t let me go on the tour because I am pregnant. I am only 5 months along but I have a big belly. I was trying to reach out to the tour operator the day before my tour to find out the details of the trip. Also, it says that they offer pick up from the hotel, if you stay in downtown (I stayed there) but nobody answered me. I got the answer like 1 hour before the start of the tour. That I have to get to meet up point myself. After I arrived the driver called the office and they told me that I can go on the tour. I paid 180$ for that tour. Also, they refused to issue a refund for me. I don’t recommend this tour and TripAdvisor stand on tour operator site not costumers. It’s impossible to get on the phone with someone from Viator/trip advisor. I am not going to use their services anymore. In the town especially central square there are a lot of tuk tuks with wonderful guides for much cheaper price that will take you on the tour.",1
I bought a cultural tour and received a ride around the city,"I booked this tour because I had little time with my parents and my husband to see and get to know the historical and cultural aspects of Lisbon and what I received was a ride to the main tourist attractions that I could have done by Uber spending 1/3 of the money I invested . Our guide Vitor was Brazilian and had lived in Lisbon for 1 and a half years. He took us places without knowing practically anything about what we were seeing. To give you an idea of the guide's level, when I asked him about São Jorge Castle he replied: it's a castle. I couldn't believe I had paid for that. He himself, noticing our frustration at the end of the tour, admitted to us that he didn't know much and needed to study the history of the city. Furthermore, the times he got out of the vehicle to explain, he walked quickly ahead and ignored my elderly parents (65 years old) who stayed behind and “lost” what little he had to say about the locations.
I was sad and disappointed with the company that doesn't qualify the people they hire.",2
Mediocre. Wouldn't do it again.,"Our guide didn't seem to know his stuff and even though we reserved the tour in Spanish, his dominion of the language wasn't good. The vehicle also stalled soon after starting the tour and I had to push to get it going. Two stars because he finished it and was nice.",2
There was no experience to give you the gist of,Driver never showed. Ruined our day. Sorry to report this. There is nothing else to report except I wish the driver showed up.,1
An uninformed & uninterested guide!,"The tour driver was Eric, a nice guy, but he provided no narration. I finally started asking a lot of questions & got a little info out of him, but not much. The visibility from the Tuk Tuk was very poor, we could hardly see anything from under the rolled up curtain.

Eric drove around, we had no idea where we were or what we were seeing. The overlooks gave us nice views, but that was the only positive of the trip. We finally cut it short & asked home to return us to a drop off point.",1
Left me and my family stranded,"Paid for a 3hr tour.

We spent 45mins with the guide and ask if he can stop so we can grab a snack. He dropped us off at a park and said he’ll be waiting on the other end of the park by the exit. We grabbed a quick bite and was problem done in 15mins. We walked through the park to the exit as instructed. Our guide was nowhere to be found. I tried to reach out to him through the TripAdvisor app. No response. We had to call an Uber since we was left stranded. I got a call/text from my guide 45mins after we got picked up from our Uber.

I wanted to rectify my issue with a partial refund. Just to receive an email from Viator that my request was denied with no explanation.

I have time stamps from my call log, texts, and chat through TripAdvisor. Along with my Uber receipt.

I do not recommend this tour base on my experience and the lack of business.",1
Bad experience,"Booked the Belem tour, guide asked what we wanted to see. Priorities were the main monuments on the itinerary. We didn’t stop or get off at any. We drove by. But we spent 15 minutes waiting in line for a pastry that wasn’t a priority stop for us. Guide took us on a strange route which he called a “shortcut”. Couldn’t hear a word he was saying. Actually ended up in old town despite it being a Belem tour. Guide said he was running out of electric charge and wanted to get back. Overall, a waste of time and money.",1
Don’t hire this tuk-tuk!,"The tuk- tuk driver didn’t seem interested in giving us a tour. He raced around Lisbon only giving information if we prompted him. We would have to say, “what’s that building”?

Then when we stopped at a monument and the guide told us we had 20 minutes to look around on our own we couldn’t find him when we returned to the tuk-tuk. He finally appeared after we started looking for him.

It seemed our guide was driving faster than the other tuk tuks. We were being thrown from side to side in the back. Also, when we asked about a beautiful building on the waterfront our guide told us not to go there. He said it was built by the Chinese and he “doesn’t trust them after Covid”.

To top off our tour our guide took us back to the hotel 30 minutes before the end of our tour.",1
Guide knew nothing about Lisbon - very disappointing,No stories heard: the guide had no knowledge of Lisbon. A taxi ride would have been cheaper and safer. Very disappointed. We asked to stop the tour earlier.,2
Disappointment,"Was very disappointed in this tour.

There were very few stops and even less in the way of a narrative from our guide as to the highlights of the City of Lisbon.

Make sure to set expectations with your driver/tour guide before departing on your trip.",1
Mal guia,"Mal, nos tocó una guia, Catalina Montero, que no tenia idea de nada. Fuimos en semana santa y llevaba muy poco tiempo en la ciudad. Tenia la sensacion que sabia yo mas de la ciudad que era la 3 vez que iba que ella. Bastante defraudado.",1
Not recommend,"Hello,
Honestly, NOT RECOMMEND IT.

Tuk-tuk driver was good and kind; however, the tour price was too high, 120 Euros for one hour and a half, and I am alone, so he should give me a discount like the other Tuk-tuk driver they gave me a discount and it’s was cheaper than the first one.
Although I did not even use the full hour and a half, he insisted that I must pay the same price since he already informed his boss that a customer had booked an hour and a half. Okay, I respect him, and I paid the amount, but I was not satisfied with the outcome.
Definitely not recommended
Instead of a tuk tuk, you can take the Hop-on-Hop-off bus, which offers four lines from which you may choose one or pay for them all. It costs only 30 euros and covers the entire city",1
Beware! you migh loose your money and get no tour at all!,"I bought a ticket in the Tuk Tour for Sunday 25 at 10 am. Once purchased, I was confirmed for Monday, October 30, 2023! There is no way to change that. Your system is a mess!",1
Worst Rental in Old Saybrook CT,"This house is a complete dump complete with rodents living in the house, the owner, Bryan Neurath is dishonest and after complaining he did nothing. When the rent was over he refused to return my security deposit and I had to sue him The house is a dump and the owner is a crook",1
Disappointed,First it was hot and our guide was struggling with the heat. Second her English was not top notch so she didn’t understand our question it was hard to understand her. Third she blamed the traffic for a slow tour which was out of her control. Anyway it is June so expect delays.,2
Tuk-Tuk Tour fand trotz Bestätigung nicht statt!,"Wir (2 Personen) hatten für 10 Uhr eine Tuk-Tuk Tour in Deutsch gebucht.
Für € 30 Aufpreis sollte die Abholung an unserer Wohnung stattfinden.
Nach Bezahlung der € 30 hatte ich mir dieses nochmals extra mit Abholadresse bestätigen lassen.
10.10 Uhr rief ich an, da das Tuk-Tuk nicht da war.
Um 10.25 Uhr erhielt ich telefonisch die Info, man hätte Probleme mit dem Tuk-Tuk gehabt. Ob die Abholung um 11.30 Uhr ok sei.
Ich bestätigte das.
Um 11.34 Uhr erhielt ich einen Anruf, sorry Tuk-Tuk ist in 5 Min da.
Um 11.45 Uhr war das Tuk-Tuk immer noch nicht da.
Somit haben wir den Vormittag mit warten verplempert!
Die Rückzahlung des gezahlten Tickets läuft, für die Extragebühr € 30 hoffentlich auch.

Ich kann diesen Anbieter aufgrund seiner Unzuverlässigkeit absolut nicht empfehlen!",1
Lisbon city visit,"Only default available again,didn't use tuk tuks but there were plenty about ,arrived on cruise ship told we needed shuttle bus to get to town centre so no prob there,we were warned not to stray from the main tourist area as pick pockets were everywhere,and to be aware of gangs of young men....great i thought........as we travelled in on the free bus,the streets were littered with homeless people still sleeping under cardboard boxes,grafitee every where,trip took 50 mins dye to chaotic traffic, we arrived in the main square which seemed ok but lots of people obviously not tourists just looking for a victim so we were very wary,anyway after about an wondering around we fought the shuttle bus back to the ship, I was expecting a beautiful city but very limited where we felt safe even with lots of police officers about extremely disappointed, will definitely not return to Lisbon again",2
Disappointing service - arrange when you arrive,Our driver arrived 30 minutes late and cut our trip short. Did not follow the tram route as advertised. My advice just go up to the tuk tuk driver of your choice when you are in Lisbon. This was a very disappointing service and there was no benefit in booking ahead.,2
Tour was changed and still not reimbursed,"This tour did not happen and I am still waiting to be reimbursed after numerous emails and texts.

The pickup location was changed just before and the tour itinerary changed due to a race that took over the areas we wanted to see. When I responded to their text, I requested a refund before the tour but did not receive an answer.

Once I got home, the company emailed me, but they said they never heard from me even though I emailed a copy of my text correspondence showing them that they actually did receive my request to cancel. I was ghosted ever since and they still have our money.

I understand that the race was not their fault, but they should know about these types of events well in advance and plan accordingly. And not take people's money if they cannot provide the service where and when they said they would.",1
Bad experience,"We booked this trip on the basis of the five-circle reviews in Tripadvisor. Unfortunately, we did not have the same excellent experience that most travelers did. Before I go into details, in case you don’t want to read my whole review, my advice is if you need to reschedule your tour, be sure to not do it in the middle of a travel day. My doing so led to miscommunication, which resulted in multiple unpleasant, unprofessional interruptions during our tour.

Now for the details. I messaged the company during our flight layover before we arrived, asking for an earlier tour date, which was quickly offered. They requested confirmation, which I was not able to immediately give because we were en route from the Montreal. After traveling for 24 straight hours, we got stuck in customs for 1.5 hours, and it was while in line there that the company called to confirm our earlier appointment. The representative gave me the name of the driver we were supposed to meet, but the name didn’t register, again, because we were exhausted from traveling and stuck in a very noisy line. We arrived at the designated meeting spot on time, and a driver arrived. I confirmed my name with her, and she showed me my name with the updated tour time on her phone, so we started our tour. About 20 minutes into our tour, I received a call from the company saying that our driver was waiting for us at the meeting spot. I told the representative that we were already on the tour, and she started to argue with me saying that we were with the wrong driver. I cut her off, and told her that was between her and the driver, and I didn’t want to get in the middle of it. I handed the driver my phone, they had an argument, and then we went on with a tour. Or so I thought. I then got another call from the company, and the representative again started arguing with me, saying that she had called to confirm with me with the driver’s name, blah blah blah – – see above. I want to emphasize that it was not our driver’s fault. The whole experience left us with a very negative opinion of the company, and I’m sure that the company will provide a response to my review.",1
Wrong tour,We booked the Welcome to Belem Tour and received the customary confirmations and meeting place instructions. We were introduced to our guide who was very nice but after awhile we were wondering when we were going to see the attractions that were listed as part of the Belem tour. At that point our guide said that he wasn’t qualified to give us that tour and said that we had been assigned to him mistakenly. He was apologetic but at that point there wasn’t anything we could do about it.,2
Terrible experience.,Our tour guide did not seem to have any plan for our tour. Trouble answering questions and learned very little. Would not recommend at all.,1
Lousy guides know nothing,"Please don't take it or find out who's on you. We're a family of six.
It happened to us that none of them could handle our language and what we hired in Spanish and they didn’t know anything about history, anything about the places we went. One knew more than another of the two we took
They even told us the tiles were for the weather.....muggy
We really voted silver
In sintra we hired wonder van it was amazing we touched Thomas who knew every part of the place everything with his story",1
Massively overrated avoid,"This must be the most overrated attraction in Lisbon. The creaking elevator struggles up the hill if the drivers actually allow you on board before they set off. Serious Napoleon complexes going on with these drivers as they man the tram that slowly climbs the graffiti riddled path to the top of the hill. These guys seem to hate their jobs so much, they really should go and do something more fulfilling!

Once at the summit the views are far from the best in Lisbon and within minutes you will have the prospect of rejoining the “happy gang” on the decent.

Overrated, avoid.",1
What goes up doesn’t always go down,"Can use your day pass on it . Classic funicular. Opposite Hard Rock Cafe . Not signposted ( unless we missed it).
Seemed to stop at 12.30 lunch.
Everyone gave up waiting. Got bus back",2
Glory Elevator - Be prepared to pay back and forth even if you don't use them,"The public transport that ends up becoming a tourist spot for the beauty of it and the place. However, they should have more respect for the tourist. The lady who runs the tram and is responsible for the sale of tickets forced us to buy round the way, even if we did not want to go back.",1
In the rain without getting us up,"On November 15, 2024 at 6 pm I tried to take the funicular that did not start from the base because the driver said she had problems with the obliterator and had to wait 20 minutes in the rain, so in 15 we climbed on foot on a very steep climb, despite having paid with the Lisbon card the transport that we were not granted. Shortly after, however, the funicular started anyway with other people inside and the driver did not let us get halfway up (firsw was not possible?). Upon arrival I asked for explanations to the same driver who made us take the rain and climb on foot (there were also elderly people) and did not give any... absurd for a tourist.
lousy tourists. Stefano",1
Loss of time,This is a joke. 1 minute to climb a street that you can walk without any problems. It is most useful for those who have traffic problems.,1
Disrespectful electrician.,"I transmit what a family experienced in this elevator. The experience could have been fantastic, if the elevator attendant had not been so EXTREMELY unpleasant to a group of eight people, two girls, the maternal and paternal grandparents, and the parents. We decided not to file a complaint but situations like this degrade the image of the city. I do not upload photographs of the official in question because we do respect people.",1
I do not recommend,"Very expensive tourist stuff. €3.80 for one minute of climbing, then descending. It takes 5 minutes on foot.
Rather take a ride on tram 28 or 12. This is wasted money, furthermore with the viva viagem which costs 6.60 per day with all transport and elevators included it makes no sense to pay for the single route.",2
"Tinha tudo para ser um bom momento, mas…","É um elevador histórico que é bonito de ver. No entanto, a crítica vai para o preço dos bilhetes (3,80€ por duas viagens), não dá para comprar apenas 1 viagem. Depois, não é benéfico encher o eléctrico acima da sua capacidade, pois, em vez de aproveitarmos a viagem, estamos com as pessoas de pé à nossa frente, a levar ou com a mochila ou com o rabo de alguém. Se a capacidade são 4 pessoas de pé (ver imagem), não acho correto deixar entrar mais pessoas (o lucro não é tudo!). Os ascensores já podiam estar “com outro ar”, pois estão todos grafitados…",1
2 Versuche.....immer kaputt,"Ganz clever.....um mir den beschwerlichen Aufstieg zu sparen habe ich zweimal versucht nach oben zu fahren. Bis ich in der Schlange stehend dran war, war die Bahn kaputt und ich musste laufen...einmal, zweimal....eine 3. Chance gibt's von mir nicht, nur ne schlechte Bewertung.",1
Not worth the cost,"On a positive it’s a beautiful piece of architecture in the middle of Lisbon and we ticked that box.

for a family of 5 at 6€ each, queuing up 20 min for a 30 second ride up isn’t worth €30. Would be great if they offered group or family prices.

Found out at the top you can walk up and go on the same viewing platform for free anyway, so you’re only paying for the lift.",2
Pretty modest view,"The elevator is an experience that you can not miss in Lisbon.
Unfortunately, there is a bit of a queue to do, despite the fact that the climb is rather rapid.
At the top the view is rather trivial, not being too high the observation point (better the view from Alfama alta).
It is not worth spending money to go to the observatory (the elevator can be taken with the normal ticket of the means).
It was a bit of a disappointment.",2
Lousy.,"The super unsympathetic people with very little (if any) desire to help, after swallowing almost 2 hours of queue, are about to go up and tell you that you have to have the right money, and only accept physical card, and according to other comments you can go up the back for free, a place that is not worth visiting",1
"Don’t waste your time and money, 1 hours waiting time","Not worth your time, this is an elevator that goes to “barrio alto” the waiting time is 1 hour and the ticket cost 6 Euros, don’t waste your time, you can go up there just walking is faster and you visit more.",1
Don’t pay with your card here.,"I paid with my card at the elevador of Santa Justa in Lisbon and, instead of being charged 6€, I was charged 10.30€. The most appalling thing is that after countless emails with this company and all the info I provided them, they were “unable” to track my transaction and consequently give me my money back. Please be aware of this company.",1
Tourist scam,"Don't get on, you can go up from behind, once you get to the top if you want to go up a little more they try to charge you 5 euros more per person, it's a huge scam for tourists and as in Lisbon when it comes to explaining something they don't explain anything, they try to take advantage of everyone, they don't explain anything, I think it's one of the cities that takes the least care of tourists, they try to deceive you in all the monuments, it's amazing",1
Interest-free,No interest in paying to reach this view or in addition there is a wire mesh. Don't waste your time walking your way or unless you have the Lisboa card,2
Expensive,"Old elevator, located in the historic center of the city of Lisbon, to ascend to the upper part of the city, you must queue, in which there is no awning or anything that covers you from the weather incidents Such as sun or rain

The price per person is 6,10€, the viewpoint is closed

Upstairs, when you go out you give me lift you enjoy beautiful views of the beautiful city, although it is all full of wire to take a photo",2
CLIMBING ON FOOT IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH!,"As per the ironic title.
As an attraction (remember it's a last century elevator) it only applies to photos from below and photos from the top.
For the rest it is not worth paying over 6 euros to stay 30 seconds crushed in the cabin of an elevator without any emotion.",2
Useless queue,Passing by Carmo Convent you can walk to the panoramic walkway. The terrace is currently closed so it is useless to queue for 45 min and pay around €7 per person,2
Pro mě nepochopitelný hype,"Nevím co konkrétně si mám o tomto myslet. Šíleně propagovaná věc. Ze zvědavosti jsem se chtěl svést, ale nikde žádný vstup, nikde žádná fronta, přitom mělo být normálně otevřeno. Jízda stojí jako klasická jedna jízda metrem a jedete asi jak dlouho, deset vteřin ? Ne díky. Tohle klidně vynechejte, nestojí to za nic.",2
Santa Justa elevator is not worth it,"Was fine but views were sub-optimal. The are much better views at nearly by Miraduoros for free. The ticket is not worth it, if you really want to go, take the backdoor walk up the stairs for free ( search for youtube videos for guidance) or get a viagem metro card, the ticket is included in that. We did that.",2
No need to pay,"Perfectly useless, you queue for an hour in February for 30 seconds of ascent, at six euros per person, all to arrive at a point that you can reach without paying passing through the high districts.
You can walk past to admire the construction, but frankly you don’t need to pay to take the elevator.",2
No grace at all,"Stupid experience, no view has, found expensive for what it offers. It's beautiful, old and gives a desire to walk. But it is very graceless . Not worth it , only if it was for free or for the elderly to rsrsrsrs",2
Cold in Lisbon,"Bad service, the queue is huge and the elevator does not move, it is impossible to understand and there is no explanation!!!
And the price of 6,10 euros is absurd",1
Award higher than experience,"the glance is worth more than the climb (6€ round trip) . very beautiful and original wrought iron construction, in the Eiffel style. and nice viewpoint at the top, but better take the funicular two streets higher, on the station side, because a lot of waiting for not much",2
Too bad.,"The view from above is very nice, shame about the rude and incapable staff.
This causes long and unnecessary waits.
The lines are not managed and when the lift arrives you have to scramble to get on.
Absolutely not recommended",1
Setback,"Nice lift but that's it.
A waste of your waiting time and €6,-
You'll be upstairs in 1 minute.
Just walk up the other side.",1
No,"No, no interest, long waiting time for ascent and descent with nothing to do through gates
I do not recommend this activity",1
Absolutely useless,"I state that we took it just out of curiosity because it was included in another ticket.
Standing 40-minute queue, with a nauseating smell on the finish. To reach a neighborhood that you can easily reach with a staircase or two small climbs. Not recommended.",1
"Don’t queue, try this alternative.","When we saw the queues we knew we weren’t going to wait then some kind local suggested another way to reach the top.
Go up the stairs at the side of the tower, up onto the main shopping street, turn left and head up the street until you see a shop with a blue sign on the right. Go up the stairs and follow the path.
This brings you up to the other side of the bridge that the lift takes you to.
You’ve saved €6 and all that queuing. The views are amazing.",2
"Useless, Undeserving and Disrespectful","As per the title:
1) Useless: the access to Bairro Alto is absolutely easy from the surrounding streets (two short climbs on busy streets surrounded by shops) so the use of the elevator has a purely aesthetic function.
2) Undeserving: the journey is extremely short and does not offer a particularly impressive view. The viewpoint accessed at the end of the climb (which offers a pleasant glimpse of the city and the castle) is accessible from the road for free and without queuing.
3) Disrespectful: We waited 20-25 minutes (little compared to other reviews) with no cover to protect from the sun. Why are you waiting? The fact that the attendants (comfortably in the shade) waited until the elevator had arrived and the passengers boarded to make the ticket. With a huge waste of unnecessary time. Because making the ticket while people wait in line is obviously too complex...",1
Just walk up,"Queues for something that is basically a 30 second elevator ride to a viewing platform which you can walk up to anyway. At €6/7 a ride it is the ultimate ripoff. Save your cash and walk up.
It looks great but not worth the wait or money. Tourist trap time.",2
There's no point in using it,"An hour's tail to get 45 seconds into an elevator where you can't see anything.
The platform can also be reached in 10 minutes by stairs.
All for €6. We had the life card zapping put anyway....
It's nice but you might as well stay outside.",1
They were still but nobody knew why,Elevator in the central area full of tourists at all hours. To improve the organization... after 1 hour of queue we left because the Elevator did not go (maybe ?) But without anyone to inform us. These days the belvedere is closed.,2
Tourist trap,"Don't bother. You can walk up to the same viewpoint for free. Or, do what we did and visit Hotel Chiado's roof terrace. Same view but spend your €6 on a great glass of wine instead and avoid the crowds.",1
Go there but don't pay - see it for free!,"The elevator dates back to 1902 and is a curiosity that is worth seeing. BUT DON'T PAY TO RIDE IT!

My daughter and I queued for about half an hour and finally it was our turn. Senor captain grumpy was in charge of tickets and pressing the up/down button. We accordingly stumped up €6 each. The interior really was nothing special. The doors were closed and an ensemble of about 20 paid-up hopefuls awaited the meteoric rise! About 30 slow and mediocre seconds later the ""ride"" was done. We had reached the viewing platform.

Unbeknown to us, the viewing platform could be freely accessed by all from behind the elevator via the local roads!

So, pay €6 each, queue for 30mins for a lame experience. Better to take a few photos at the base of the elevator, walk round the back and up to viewing area and then spend the €12 on a glass of wine for me and ice cream for my daughter!",2
Don't queue or pay,"Without queuing now, you can climb up the easy mountain and get to the same place where the elevator goes up. Same exact view!!",1
DO NOT GO,"DO NOT GO. I'm not one to usually cry ""tourist trap"" because I find most sites have some value to it. However, I regretted paying for this - there's a long wait (I think there was an mechanical issue with the elevator), it's expensive, and you can't see anything in the ride up anyway because of all the metal railings. And it's cash only. Spend it on a few pasteis de nata instead; it will be much more satisfying.

The WORST PART - the observation deck was closed anyway! They conveniently omitted that fact and collected full price from unsuspecting tourists.

There are free elevators/escalators around the city you can utilize to get up the hill. Or you can Uber/Bolt for even cheaper.",1
Disappointment,"I don't think it's worth it, at €6 per person it's a foolish fool.
No remarkable views and with its own closed viewpoint.
And also queues, 20 P. per trip.",1
Lamentable,"Hello, despite the presentation of my skip-the-line card allowing a disabled person in need of an attendant, to access this monument, the agent did not allow my attendant to come with me without queuing. So I couldn't visit.",1
Better to save your $5 Euro,This attraction is best suited for those with walking impairments and requiring assistance. Otherwise a simple walk to the top of the hill is far more enjoyable.,1
A shame!,"A shame for the exhausting wait of over an hour, without receiving any information. No operator present who could ask for information about it, no reporting of waiting times that would have helped decide whether to wait or not. An hour wasted! Highly not recommended!!",1
A well packaged package,"The structure is very beautiful and is a Los Angeles architectural feature.
But…
The very long queue and the price are absolutely absurd and unjustified.
The viewpoint at the top of the Elevador is in fact directly accessible via a ""bridge"" that connects it with Bairro alto, at the height of the Carmo convent, the church ""without the roof"" so to speak. Without paying a cent.
However, we tried the experience in the evening, just before closing, taking advantage of the very short queue and the fact that the price was included in the excellent Lisboa City Card.
The short and insipid ascent does not offer any additional glimpses of the view from the viewpoint.",1
Disappointing and waste of money.,"Not worth the time or money. Waited 30min get into it, €6 per person, ride takes 1min, no view or commentary in the lift. Very top viewing platform closed. Just take the stairs at the back if you to see the view.",1
"Well, it doesn't have to be","Nice view, but that's about it. The lift looks exciting inside, but you don't feel quite so safe. Unfortunately, the staff were not very friendly and were pretty grumpy in the morning. A shame for the nice short trip. It's a visit for a few minutes.",2
Disappointing,"Unless there's no queue and can ride for free with the 24 hour transport ticket, do not bother. Very easy to walk up the streets behind the lift and get the same view. Better yet, do the Gloria funicular or the Alfama miradouras, all much better value and views.",1
Catch idiots! Run away!,"If there is one attraction not to do, it’s this one! Wait 1h30 to take an elevator from which you can't see anything to get to a viewpoint...you just have to keep going up the stairs, it's next to the convent and from there it's free.",1
Luckily it is included in the Lisbon Card,"Calling it an attraction is definitely too much. €6 to get on and off within 2 minutes is really too much. The view from above is beautiful, but...",2
Avoid!,"I only took it because it was free with the Lisbon card... and it was still a mistake. It's only one lift and the queue is exasperatingly slow, you'll waste an hour or more to go to a point that can be reached on foot in a few minutes!",1
Tourist trap,"Tourist trap!!
Particular and worth seeing from the street.
But paying €6 each for a return trip (even at different times) is a steal.",1
"View was nice, elevator took too long","The idea is nice, it is included with the Lisboa card, but via the back you can take the stairs instead of the elevator for 6 euros to the same view point. Queues are very long for basically nothing.",2
Waste of time,"An extremely long wait for nothing very special. Queued for nearly an hour and although the views were spectacular, they were no better than you can get from just walking up to the area. 6 euros not expensive but the waste of valuable time so not worth it!",2
A huge tourist trap. A scam,"First you have to wait in line for like forever. Then there is no information about how to pay for the stupidly high tariff. 6 euros! It is a scam. There is a small sign that say they only take cash. Ok, we had cash, but when we got onboard the lift, the man claimed you had to have exact amount! He then refused and said he could not exchange pn a 50 euro bill - we were 3 people. We left. Serioisly, you can not treat tourists this way. It is a huge tourist trap. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Seriously, put up better information that people can see before they get in line.

A tip? Take the free elevator at the bottom of the shopping center. Walk up to the Camp Convent - beautiful place, not a tourist trap - walk around the back and get the view from the elevator tower for free.",1
Do not do it,"The elevator is definetly not recommended. It costs 6 Eur, the trip itself takes just 1 minute and you have to wait for ages. You do not see much during the ride. I would just take a picture of the elevator - that is more than sufficient!",1
"Waste of time, money, and life","Don’t go. The elevator is a beautiful piece of architecture, but this can be seen from the outside. The elevator is horribly inefficient so the queue lasts over an hour. But worse, you can just visit the viewing platform by climbing to the Carmo Convent without the elevator.",1
Useless,"Useless elevator, going up and down you can't enjoy any view. The arrival platform is also accessible from Rua do Carmo and therefore the 6 euros per person for the ticket are really wasted. We did it because the ticket is included in the Lisboa Card",2
Unwatchable and useless,"Even though this lift from the late 1800s (1898) is one of the attractions of the city and attracts numerous tourists, in my opinion, it is aesthetically very ugly and above all useless.
In fact, to get to the Carmo area you just need to climb a few dozen steps and it probably takes less time than the lift (given the numerous queues that form to access it).
Furthermore, the elevator is located in the middle of the buildings and a view of part of the city is only possible from the arrival platform.
Access is subject to a fee.",2
Overated/overpriced,Totally overpriced and overated .... you can walk three minutes instead of waiting on the line and take the elevator ...,2
Don’t bother. Just don’t. Really. There are a million and one better things to do with your precious time in Lisbon.,Wait ages. Not sure how long but over an hour. On an early Tuesday morning in late February! Gosh knows how long the wait will be in summer. The ride up lasts less than 2 minutes. You can’t really see anything out of the windows on the way up. The views at the top are ok but you can get them just by walking there and there are better elsewhere. Later in the day (when we had taken the elevator earlier) my wife and I wandered up to Chiado - hilly but easily ok if you take it slowly - and found ourselves above the top of the lift. This is one of the most over hyped tourist attractions ever. Don’t waste your time.,1
No interest,"30 minutes of waiting, 2 minutes of climbing. No additional interest in taking it. The viewpoint is easily reached on foot via another access. 6€, included in the Lisboa card (in this case… it’s an experience).",2
Better on foot,"I do not recommend it, the panoramic view can also be enjoyed on foot from other parts of the city, having paid dearly for the ticket and among other things the top floor is closed
I don't recommend it",2
Do with the lisboa car,"6€ to go up and down with the elevator... knowing that you can access the view for free.
I would advise doing it with the Lisbon Card as it is included among the free activities.",2
"Do not queue take some stairs, save time and money","The tower itself is impressive, however do not waste time and money taking the lift. Walk across the road, going under the walkway, turn left, go about 50 metres and turn right up some stairs, turn right at end if the stairs, walk about 100 metres and go up the next stairs, ut will take you up to the sane walkway that the lift does.",2
Lisbon weekend,"Much too expensive for a view that can be seen elsewhere. Possible to go there on foot by going up from behind, about 10 steps… it’s a steal",1
Wasted money,"Don't go there, there's a queue, you pay 6 euros for tickets to take a crowded lift and not see anything... Greetings, it's full of railings... the view is terrible",1
Senseless,A senseless wait in difficult conditions. Better to walk up slowly and enjoy the walk. Six euros wasted.,1
To be avoided,It's absolutely not worth it. Almost 2 hours of queuing for a 20 second elevator ride (6 euros if you don't have the lisboa card or other cards that include it) to have a view that you can have in many other places in lisbon,1
do not bother,"It there is queue do not bother joining it, it was a waste of money. The queue was very slow moving on account that the lift only hold 15 people. We queued for over an hour and paid 12euros only to discover when you get off the lift we could have walked to the same viewing point from over the bridge. we wasted so much time. Just come in from the other side and enjoy the views",2
Go see it but don't get in it.,"Go see the elevator but don't pay to get in it. More than 50 minutes of waiting. Impossible to buy a one-way ticket for 4 euros. Price imposed at 8 euros for a round trip and what's more, that day, the cabin responsible for bringing the passengers down was under construction.
In short, a real tourist trap. The climb only lasts a few seconds and what's more, we don't have a view of the street side (but of the walls).
The staff is nice, the elevator is very beautiful, but admire it from the bottom.",1
Scam and waste of time,1h30 wait for a climb of less than a minute and without visibility while the platform at the top is free and freely accessible from the right of the Convent of the Carmelites!!!!! Unless you like wasting your time and waiting standing for the sake of waiting standing? Tell your friends.,1
Don't waste your time,"There's no way that makes this worth your time standing in a largely 'un-moving queue (over 1 hour in my case!) for what comes at the end. Yes, the views are fairly good ( nowhere near those from the castle) but with the uppermost viewing platform currently 'closed' the time spent getting there is likely to be more than the time spent queueing .... unless, maybe, you stop to have a drink at the bar/cafe at 'the top' and/or listen to the busker.

From what I could make out there's only 1of2 lifts working and there appears no rationale as to when it goes up/down with no apparent monitoring of how many people remain atop for how long. Very quickly (after taking a few photos) I decided to travel (back) down but there was no indication when the lift would return ... there were 2 police officers (also) waiting but they gave up and when down steps(?) WHEN the lift did arrive (& deposited some people from the (ridiculous) queue, I was the only person (apart from operator) in the descending lift.",1
Good marketing service from the city of Lisbon. The one hour wait does not justify this elevator.,"1 hour wait for a viewpoint that you can see by going around the back and going up a few steps
I think the city has a great marketing department
It's a tourist trap",2
to flee,"To avoid: go up on foot, it's free.
You can reach the top platform on foot without waiting in line.",1
Tourist scam,"Only a small handful of people can board every 10 minutes for €5.60. We waited more than 1 hour 20 minutes to take the elevator. Once at the top, what a disappointment: the platform was closed and we realized that we could have just as easily made the journey on foot... big tourist scam.",1
The scam of the century,"You will wait in an endless queue to get a two-minute elevator ride at 5.30 euros per head to arrive at a platform accessible to all on foot via Rue des Carmes. Even if it's included in the Lisboa card, don't waste your time in this endless queue at 9 a.m. which moves at a snail's speed to be greeted with relative friendliness! Go on your way…",1
To observe from afar,"No need to get in the elevator! The architecture is nice (rua Augusta) to observe from below, and it's free! Otherwise the top is accessible via Place des Carmes. And the viewpoint is accessible to everyone!",2
A bit of a scam despite the beauty of the building,"As it is included in the Lisbon card and as we pass in front, we stop. 20 minutes in line (up every 10 minutes by 15 max) for 2 minutes in the elevator.
Arriving at the top, we see that we come from there on foot (near the Carmelite convent) and that we can get there on foot by climbing about a hundred steps.
Tourist trap that can be avoided",2
Do not bother,Waste of time and money. Don't bother with this queue. So many better free views all over city. Its just a lift and then u can walk back down little streets.,1
Do not ! It's worthless!,"Terrible long line due to an arrogant elevator attendant who was wasting his time talking and being interesting instead of operating the elevator. The line was immensely long and not worth it. The view is not worth it, because the elevator is not very high. Definitely don't do that!",1
Do not bother,"When my wife and I first showed up, we joined a long line snaking up the steps from the entrance at the bottom. After quite some time, we wondered if the lift was broken because nothing happened for several minutes after we arrived. We were relieved when we finally saw the lift moving, thinking that meant we could expect regular trips to resume. We were sorely mistaken. After about half an hour of waiting, we looked up some more details online and learned that the lift operates about once every ten minutes, carrying about 24 people up at a time. There appears to be no reason why the lift only operates once every ten minutes, as the ride itself takes mere seconds, and it cannot take too long to load--not that I would really know, since we gave up and left before we got anywhere near the entrance. Save yourself the trouble and skip this attraction.",1
"Definitely worth seeing, the climb is not worth it if there is a queue","We confirm what many have written, if you have to wait in a long queue to go up it, avoid it, it is worth seeing it from below (even in the evening) and for the view from above it is possible to access it for free by passing from the side of the Carmo Convent.",1
Well yes…….,"I really don't understand why I have to queue for an hour for the lift. It's an old lift... and the ride still costs money. You can easily walk up the small hill and enjoy the view. The lift is a great photo subject but nothing more
Atmosphere: overcrowded
Price/performance: not worth it
Recommend: Photo",2
It's not worth it,"After waiting almost an hour to get on the lift, I discover that the price is €5.30 per person. The elevator goes up for about 30 seconds, and at times you can't even enjoy the ride. Once you get there, there is a very beautiful view of the city, but I discover that it would have been enjoyable even if you reached this point from a small road behind, obviously free. Furthermore, you can easily enjoy this panorama from many other “Miradouros” along the city, free of charge. As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth paying for this attraction, I personally recommend instead spending the money on other points of interest.",1
Tourist trap,"We visited the attraction during a crowded day and, after a long wait, we were able to see the monument from inside. Cost of €5.30 per person for about a minute inside an ancient elevator through which you can't see anything of the outside. Once you reach the top you find yourself on a terrace which can be easily reached on foot via the road behind. The view from the viewpoint is beautiful but also possible from other viewpoints in Lisbon (sometimes free).
Not an advisable experience, given the long waits and the money spent unnecessarily",1
Horrible memory,"This establishment does not comply with regulations on priority access for disabled people.
The goalkeeper was very aggressive and did not let us pass.",1
What a rip-off!,"I honestly didn't think to check Trip...big mistake
Almost an hour in the queue, €5.30 (uphill only) and then discovering that I could get to the same point on foot in 2 minutes
But I spent about twenty seconds in a very beautiful wooden cabin….
Avoid it, it's not worth it",1
I wonder what the meaning is,"A panoramic lift, built in 1901 that allows you to quickly reach Largo do Carmo and admire the Baixa from above in all its beauty.
Hours in line (because it leaves at set times and in any case when it's convenient for them). The journey will last 40 seconds?? and the price is 5.30 euros (to be paid in cash!! With the Viva Viagem card entry is free, otherwise I would have avoided it and, in light of the facts, I would have done well!) This is called ridiculous. Also because two steps uphill on foot and you arrive at the same point. It's totally useless. Never have I felt so stupid for wasting time standing in line to do what exactly? 40 seconds locked in a cabin from which you can't see anything? Beautiful to look at just from the outside.",1
Unnecessary waste of money,"1 hour long queue and 5.30€ ticket when you can just walk to the very same spot from the back of Convento do Carmo. It is not a similar spot, it is the very same one. Just walk.",1
Do not ride this!,"The viewing platform at the top is closed. So, you wait in line for an hour to ride an elevator and see nothing that you can't see from any other high point in the city. It is a total waste of time. Also, we thought at first that the line was going quickly. When we were the group that would go on next, nothing happened for over 30 minutes. Did it break down? We have no idea because they tell you nothing. We just stood there like idiots feeling like we had already waited too long already to give up.

They should honestly just close this. It is stupid. At least we didn't waste any money because it is included in the unlimited metro card.

Please do not waste your time. Better views from the city can be seen from the Castle and many other places.",1
Not elevated above 1-star,1 hour queue for a dirty 60-second elevator to a view obscured by wire screens. €5.30 fare. You could walk through the square to the Convento de Carmo and come to the same viewing platform for free.,1
A big rip-off,"Too much useless waiting, no indication on how to avoid waiting and wasting money.
You can access the tower from the stairs.
Not recommended",1
Fatal,It's not worth going up. Full of people and closed top. Endless queue and 10 or less people board at a time every 12 minutes.,1
Mirador closed!!!,"Everyone queues, the Carris employee collects €5.30 per person from you and you go up to discover that the viewpoint is closed. You therefore pay for the elevator and ultimately discover a screened space with no real view of Lisbon since the top floor is not accessible. No sign to tell you before spending unnecessarily and waiting for 30 minutes for nothing…",1
The elevator of disappointed expectations,We queued for an hour and a half under the sun to see a not extraordinary Lisbon from above. The tower is much more beautiful seeing it from below but there is absolutely no need to go up if you only have time to spare because it's not worth it. the hours in line,2
It can very well be avoided...,"Honestly, unless you have the Lisboa Card, which also includes this ticket, I would avoid it, for the following reasons:
1 - long and very slow queue
2 - the view is nothing special (there are much better ""miradouri"" in Lisbon)
3 - ticket price too high (to use a lift lasting 1 minute)
4 - passing from the back of the Carmo Convent you arrive at the same platform, free of charge and in a very short time",2
Lisbon family dinner,"The steak was only fat, no quality, a good chef knows this too, not worth repeating, the dessert was tasty",2
Trappola per turisti,"Assolutamente trappola per turisti. 5,30 euro a persona, salita due piani di ascensore, per godere una vista che si apprezza molto meglio dal castello oppure da una terrazza (gratuita) salendo le scale laterali del monastero del carmo.",1
Torre di Santa Giusta,"Il prezzo del biglietto é eccessivo in considerazione del fatto che l'accesso alla torre é comunque garantito da un ponte che si collega con una rampa di scale alla via che costeggia il lato destro della Basilica del Carmo. Difatti utilizzando questo accesso si può accedere liberamente alla piattaforma della torre senza pagare nessun biglietto. L'accesso da questo lato presenta comunque un cancello che deve rimanere sempre aperto per ovvie ragioni di sicurezza. Inoltre anche se il cancello fosse chiuso rimane comunque libera un'area pubblica allo stesso livello della piattaforma della torre dalla quale si può godere soprattutto di notte la medesima vista sulla Citta' di Lisbona. Inutile, quindi fare la fila. Il prezzo del biglitto pari a euro 5,30, inoltre, si può giustificare come obolo per la sua manutenzione. Negativo il giudizio soprattutto per come viene rappresentata questa attrazione della Città di Lisbona che ad eccezione di questo neo rimane affascinante ed incantevole.",1
No pierdas tu tiempo y dinero aquí,"No vale la pena en absoluto, es un simple ascensor que te sube a una parte de arriba a la que puedes llegar fácilmente paseando. La subida en el ascensor dura 30 segundos y el precio es exagerado, más de 5€. No pierdas el tiempo y date un paseo hasta la parte de arriba y ahorras tiempo, dinero y conseguirás las mismas fotos.",1
Horrível!,"Experiência horrível! €5 por pessoa (aproximadamente 30 reais por pessoa sendo que éramos 5) pra andar de elevador. A ida foi tranquila por mais que tivesse apenas um elevador funcionando, foi rápido, não tivemos que esperar na fila, porém, só podiam entrar 15 pessoas no elevador e na volta a fila estava ENORME. Perguntamos para o funcionário onde era pra a subida e ele foi SUPER grosso e mal educado e ainda por cima disse que seriam 2 HORAS de espera na fila sendo que havia a possibilidade de subir as lombas a pé. Além de ser caro e demorado, existem opções mais legais e mais rápidas do que isso. Mol vezes melhor poder andar pelas ruas vendo as lojas, monumentos etc do que subir nesse elevador. Mal organizado, caro e sem graça! Não recomendo para ninguém!",1
Skuffende,"Fin elevator men oplevelsen står ikke mål med prisen og den lange kø
Turen tager måske 20 sekunder
Mange andre udkigsposter i byen.",2
No merece la pena subir,"No merece la pena en absoluto, ni el elevador mientras sube (que solo ves hierro), ni las vistas arriba, que sin más, tejados y poco más. Y el precio es escandaloso si no lo llevas ya incluido en la tarjeta de transporte. Es preferible subir el ascensor del arco de la plaza de comercio, que las vistas, si son espectaculares..",1
Overrated sight in Lisbon,"This is an overrated sight that is best seen from a distance and is not worth the long wait to go up by lift.

The beauty is best to enjoy from outside, there are plenty of other places that give a much nicer view than the top of this elevator.",2
"Teuer, nur ein Aufzug in Betrieb und Aussichtsplattform gesperrt",Wir hatten die Fahrt gratis in der Lisboa-Karte dabei. Sonst wär es das absolut nicht wert. Aussichtsplattform ist derzeit (wohl länger) gesperrt. Auch fährt derzeit nur einer der beiden Aufzüge (schaut auch auf längere Zeit aus). Wartezeit ist zu hoch.,2
Accessible à pied par la place Carmo sans faire la queue . Pour ceux voulant monter via l'ascenseur prix inclus dans le pass 24h,"La montée dans l'ascenseur coûte 5€ ou est comprise dans le pass metro de 24h à 6.60€.
Vous payer et attendez un très long moment juste pour monter en ascenseur.
Sachez que vous pouvez accéder en haut de Santa Justa par le musée Carmo situé derrière ! C'est d'ailleurs la porte de sortie pour descendre du point de vue.

Je ne comprends pas que les guides ne mentionnent pas cet accès facile et gratuit !!",2
Do not loose your time and money this elevator is a swindle.,"Do not loose your money and time.
This elevator is just an elevator and it does not worth waiting half an hour for nothing.
The best view is from the castle",1
Incomprensible tanta gente en Lisboa en el mes de abril,Las colas son impresionantes cuando realmente lo que hace es un ascensor que sube arriba y baja o sea que tampoco vale la pena si quieres buenas vistas puedes subir las calles y verlo desde arriba,2
"Better from the outside, don’t bother going in","Decided to go later in the day, we vowed we wouldn’t queue for anything else on this holiday after the hellish time we had in Sintra. The queue didn’t look too bad so we decided to hang around, a queue of around 40 people still took 40 minutes. It really wasn’t worth it but at least it was included in our 24 hour travel pass.
I would recommend just looking from the outside plus when we reached the top we realised you can just walk onto the viewing platform without a ticket.
Lisbon is great but we have decided not to bother with any of the tourists attractions as they come with massive queues, unorganised staff and leave you feeling frustrated, also a lot of them just aren’t worth it.",1
Just a lift to no where.,"So this is a famous and well located lift in the middle of Lisbon that takes you to a viewing platform all in a beautiful Victorian contraption.

However, unless you have a travel/Lisboa card the price of €~5 is comically high to travel on it. The ques are crazy and VERY slow moving. The views are ok, but you have safety mesh in the way so pictures are tricky.
But the most important fact, YOU CAN ACCESS THE VIEWING PLATFORM FOR FREE by walking up there.

Note.
In May 2023, the top area was closed and the platform that the lift stops at was completely open. Even when everything was working it looked like you still get pretty decent access for nothing.

Seriously save your money and time and give it a swift avoid!",2
Pas de file pour les PMR,"À faire au moins une fois dans la vie mais si vous faites partie des personnes à mobilités réduites passez votre chemin car ZÉRO considération. Enceinte avec un enfant en bas âge, et il y avait aussi 2 personnes aveugles qui faisaient la queue avec nous.",2
Pas terribles,"Faire 1h de queue pour 1min de monté, je vous conseille de faire une photo et de monter à pieds
Heureusement cette activité était comprise dans le pass Lisbonne car payer 5€ pour 1 personnes et faire que la montée car la descente était en panne franchement abusé",1
Not worth standing on a queue for an hour to get there!,"If you are alone there so it to the good view but if you are gonna wait an hour in the queue, it is really not worth it.
You have the view in other point without waiting for hours.",2
no merece la pena,"una hora y media de cola, 5€ la entrada y cuando llegamos arriba nos dicen que el mirador esta fuera de servicio. Un a estafa total.",1
Attrape touristes,"Nous avons attendu 1 heure et demie pour une ascension de quelques secondes.

Worst thing in the whole of Portugal.,"I have no idea whatsoever why people visit this. You have to queue for ages (half an hour, hour is common) just to ride in an elevator when you can walk up yourself for free and a fraction of the time. They charge you 5.30 euros for the privilege which is a complete and total rip off.
I can't understand why the guy operating the lift takes everyone money on the way in and this isn't done while you're waiting in the queue as it would make things so much quicker.
I was a stupid tourist by going up in the lift, I didn't realise how expensive it would be, how long it would take (I didn't realise how long the line was as it continued a bit downstairs).
It was by far the worst thing I ever did the whole of Portugal.",1
Bon que pour les touristes,"Une queue interminable pour faire l'aller-retour, facturé plus de 5 €. Un attrape touristes pur et dur. Aux dires de notre guide, seuls les touristes empruntent l'ascenseur, les lisboètes préfèrent monter à pied par les escaliers et les ruelles. Décrit comme un incontournable de Lisbonne, à éviter. On prendra des photos et basta !",2
No vale la pena hacer cola,"No vale la pena hacer cola para subir un 30 segundos en ascensor. Es bonito de ver, y sobre todo el museo de arqueologia de arriba, pero se puede ir andando. La cola es muy larga, mala informacion, caro... Id a ver el elevador y la zona, pero hacer cola no vale la pena",2
Perdida de tiempo,"Estas en cola durante más de una hora. Después el ascensor tarda unos 15 minutos en bajar a recoger a la gente que esta esperando, y despues te das cuenta que solo tarda unos segundos en subir.¿porque tarda tanto en bajar? Menos mal que las vistas son magníficas.",2
Une magnifique réalisation derrière une énorme arnaque,"Évitez vous cette énorme arnaque à touristes. La plate-forme tout là -haut est gratuite et facile d’accès. Donc vous passez derrière l’ascenseur en montant les escaliers ou tout le monde fait la queue et vous montez 50 m. Au milieu de cette rue sur la droite des escaliers. Prenez les. Arrivés en haut tournez à droite allez jusque l’arche du musée et pénétrez sur la plate-forme. Voilà vous avez économisé de l’argent et évitez au moins 1h de queue car il faut savoir que seulement 24 personnes à la fois peuvent monter dans l’ascenseur. Pas plus!!!
Bon courage si vous voulez vous en rendre compte par vous-même",1

Lentísimo,"El timo no esta en el precio, que dicho sea de paso esta incluido en la Lisboa Card. El timo esta en el tiempo que te hace perder",1
Attrape touristes. Fuyez,"A moins de vouloir absolument une photo dans l'ascenseur, inutile ! Plus d'une heure d'attente, c'est très mal organisé, pas du tout optimisé.

Passez votre chemin,"Mais qu'elle déception et qu'elle arnaque ! 1h20 de queue pour...rien...on ne l'a même pas pris pour descendre ! Le billet carris n était plus valable de 15mn /24h après tout ce temps d'attente, j'ai dû payer 5.3 €...
Franchement montez par la ruelle si vous tenez au point de vue, mais ne vous trompez pas, l'entrée est dessous...",1
Una presa in giro,"Anche in questo caso le guide parlavano di esperienza da provare. Evitate di perdere tempo in una lunga attesa. L'ascensore porta sulla torretta dove si può ammirare il panorama dall'alto. La fregatura sta nel fatto che ci si può accedere anche a piedi, dal convento do Carmo.",1
"Passez par l’autre coté, c’est gratuit!","Attrape touriste!!!! Faites le tour et passez par l’autre coté, vous y aurez accès gratuitement!!! Payer plus de 5e par personne pour une montée en ascenseur de 20 seconde maximum et une vue vraiment pas top… nous étions choqué de l’arnaque! De plus, la file d’attente est longue, vous perdez votre temps!",1
Restez dehors !,"Prenez des photos , le plus beau est à l extérieur ! Structure extérieure magnifique !

2 ore di coda? Anche no!!!!,"Non ne vale la pena , perdere 2 ore in fila! Meglio andare a piedi! Noi dopo mezz’ora di coda abbiamo rinunciato, nonostante avessimo la Lisbona Card, ripeto non ne vale la pena: tempo perso!",1
Do not queue for this,"One member of our party really wanted to do this. We queued for 90 minutes for a 60 second ride with dirty windows. It was €5.20 each and only cash. If you walk for 15 minutes to the square with the Convento do Carmo you can access the same viewing platform for free and if you are really need to go in and old elevator you can go down in it for €1.60 and no queue. It was highly anticipated, over hyped and missed in a blink",1
Un timo,"Es un atentico timo. Guardas cola mas de una hora para subir es un ascensor hasta el mirador pensando que al ser metalico que la unica via de acceso a el es el ascensor y cuando estas arriba te das cuenta que se puedellegar en 5 o 10 minutos andando por varias calles normales y corrientes.
El timo no esta en el precio, que dicho sea de paso esta incluido en la Lisboa Card. El timo esta en el tiempo que te hace perder en la visita a la ciudad",1
Zonde van je tijd,"Niet doen.. Kost je bijna 6 euro en een uur van je leven in de wachtrij. Ritje duurt 19 seconden en je ziet er niets van.
Als je toch van het uitzicht wilt genieten, strek dan de benen en wandel rustig en steil omhoog. Dat kan via prachtige straatjes aan de achterzijde van deze lift.",2
Lamentable,"Si bien la estructura es ""bonita"" y apreciable desde distintos sitios y miradores de la ciudad en si , gastarse el dinero en subir o acceder a su mirador ( cerrado desde hace tiempo al parecer) teniendo en cuenta las colas y gente que suele haber es perder el tiempo recomiendo subir a cualquier otro mirador la ciudad tiene decenas de ellos muchos más bonitos , sin tanta gente.",1
Don’t waste your time or money,"We queued for the lift for just over an hour. The lift is mentioned as one of the ‘things to do’ in Lisbon. Basically, you queue for a lift to a viewing platform that can be accessed by another means. I agree with other reviewers. Skip the line. It will be an hour ( or more) of your life you won’t get back! Very disappointing. 😞",2
Une arnaque,"Énormément d’attente pour pas grand chose
On a un meilleur point de vue de la ville des miradors. Et oui il faut payer pour monter et repayer pour descendre
Je ne le recommande pas
En plus on ne peut même pas monter sur la plate-forme supérieure et cela on ne vous le pas. Par ailleurs le portier est aimable comme un manche à balai.
Faites une photo de la structure et passer votre chemin. Il y a mieux à faire à Lisbonne",1
Initile,"Coda interminabile e totalmente inutile, in quanto si può arrivare alla terrazza proseguendo sulla salita a sinistra dopo le scale. Fanno salire a gruppi di circa dieci persone ad un costo di 5.30 (oppure gratuito con Lisbona card, o con biglietto metro giornaliero) ma non ne vale assolutamente l'attesa, solo tempo perso. La salita dura circa 45 secondi, l'ascensore è bello, ma ripeto inutile. Potete fotografarlo e poi salire a piedi. Averlo saputo prima non avrei mai atteso così tanto.",1
"Don’nt waste time in queue, walk there instead","Use only if there are no queues and You have transport ticket (24h transport ticket which van be bought in metro stations includes rides on trams, buses, metro AND lifts and elevators).

Il y a par ailleurs d'autres points de vue bien plus beaux.",1
Waardeloos,Na ruim een uur in de rij te staan in minder dan 1 minuut boven. Beetje rondgelopen en weer via de trap naar beneden. De wachttijden zijn extreem. Voor 1 minuut omhoog en 1 minuut omlaag (incl. In en uitstappen) neemt de lift ruim 10 minuten. Er gaan 15 personen in de lift. Dus reken je wachttijd maar uit,1
Think hard you'll be waiting a long time!!!,"Bear in mind this is February & before the high season. There is only one car working currently so that is making things worse. The queue was over 1.5 hours to ride to the top. Then the viewing gallery is closed. So whilst the views are good they'd be even better from the top level. It takes them an age to get the car from the ground to the top and back down again. The numbers that can fit in the car are small which does not help. I know that it is 120 years old but it seems to take 120 mins to make one journey up & down!
The cafe at the top serves cod & cheese fish cakes which are excellent. Limited drinks menu & nothing beyond the fish cakes. It's as pricey as you'd expect but the quality is good. Beware however it is card only & no cash!",2
Absolutamente Prescindible,"Es absolutamente ridículo usar el elevador.
La espera es de al menos 45 o 60 minutos para un recorrido de apenas unos segundos.
La frecuencia del elevador es absolutamente nula, lo que hace pensar que está motivado por una penosa gestión.",1
longa fila,"A longa fila de espera não compesa a paisagem, que mesmo bonita pode ser acessada a pé! vale pelo conteúdo histórico.",2
"Just Look, Don't Ride!","The person who coined the phrase ""You've been taken for a ride!"" probably rode and wrote about this elevator. First, service is very slow that there is a very long queue to get in. Second, it will cost you 5,60EU for the 30-second ride unless you have a Viva Viagem (24-hour card).

Take note : This elevator is not handicapped-friendly. When you get off the elevator, the only way to the upper town is through the steps going down to the small street toward the museum.",2
Long queue for a short ride,We queued for the lift for quite a long time. The structure was quite interesting and the information good. But the ride in the lift was very short and when we got to the top we found the viewing platform was closed so we didn't get the full effect. But it did get to a part of the city we probably wouldn't have visited.,2
Pérdida de tiempo y dinero,"Muy caro, de ningún modo justifica las largas colas que genera. Existen otros accesos sencillos a la zona del Carmo, y mejores miradores en la ciudad. Además, la terraza-mirador está cerrada y nos comentaron que posiblemente de forma definitiva.",2
Geld klopperij,"Na 1 uur wachten EUR 5,30 betaald voor een ritje van 20 seconden. Boven gekomen weinig spectaculairs....over de brug gelopen staat men binnen 1 minuut weer in de achtergelegen straat.

Bellissimo a vedersi da fuori.,"Bello, eh! Ma 30 minuti di coda per 25 secondi di salita non li merita!
Fate una bella foto da fuori, perchè è bellissimo, ma poi raggiungete il punto superiore a piedi, mediante una breve salita.",2
Ladrocinio,"Il viaggio verso il Carmo dura 30 secondi, il prezzo è €5.60, il numero di persone permessi è 15 e le corse ogni 10 minuti!

Una fesseria,"Una fesseria. Coda chilometrica per 1' di ascensore che porta a una balconata che si raggiunge gratis con una scala dal retro. Forse se la terrazza panoramica è aperta (poi da raggiungere a piedi), ci può anche stare pagare il biglietto, ma dubito. Consiglio: lasciate perdere. Se proprio non riuscite a farne a meno, passate da dietro, foto e via.",1
Waste of time,"Wasted over an hour waiting for the lift, absolutely not worth it.

Worth walking to see it from below as the structure is impressive but I wouldn’t wait more than 10 minutes for the ‘experience’",1
Una autentica perdida de tiempo,"Sinceramente, me pareció una pérdida de tiempo. Primero estuvimos una hora de reloj haciendo cola para subir a un ascensor que dura literalmente 15 segundos. En nuestro caso, como teníamos la tarjeta de transporte, no pagamos los 5 eurazos que vale subir. Luego te lleva a un mirador, las vistas son bonitas pero nada que no veas en los tropecientos miradores que hay en la ciudad. Cuando salimos, nos dimos cuenta que desde la parte de atrás donde está la salida (sin vigilante ni nada), se podía entrar GRATIS. La ""entrada"" en cuestión está de camino al Convento do Carmo para los que no queráis subir sin hacer cola y gratis.",1
A total tourist rip off,"They charge 4.80 Euros for a return ticket and you can't get a single ticket. When we looked at the ticket it said that it was valid for two trips so, as we were going up on two days for a concert, we decided to walk down on the first day so we could use the return ticket the next day. So we got on the next day and presented our tickets. The driver was possibly the most unpleasant person I've ever come across. He just said 'you can't use this'. I pointed out that the ticket said it was valid for two trips. He said 'only on the same day'. So I asked where it said that. He just ignored that and said I had to buy new tickets. This was at 8:15 in the evening so I pointed out that it would be impossible to use the return ticket as the funicular stops at 8:30 and could we just pay for a single ticket. Again he just ignored that and told me to pay by credit card. So a total rip off for tourists and a really horrible man to have to deal with.",1
Nothing special,"View from going up is not very nice - there are buildings on both sides close to the tram. If I would need to buy I ticket I would have been really disapponted. 24h hour ticket which can be bought in metro stations for 6,6eur includes all lifts, metro, trams and busses. We ascended and walked down throught nice little streets - that was beautiful",2

Beware – This Company Is Not What It Seems,"I feel obligated to warn others: Elite Trip Unipessoal LDA, registered as a tourism business, is actually operating as an unlicensed construction/renovation company. I hired them (under the direction of Nuno Silva) for a home renovation project, and it turned into a nightmare.

They took full payment, abandoned the job 70% complete, and left behind dangerous electrical work that had to be redone by a licensed professional. The finishing was sloppy, the damage to my property was extensive, and after receiving final payment, they completely ghosted me.

This is not a legitimate or trustworthy business. They are misusing a tourism business license to offer construction services, which is highly unethical—and possibly illegal.

If you see this company offering any kind of renovation or building service, stay far away. Totally unprofessional, dishonest, and not what they claim to be.",1
Totally unpleasant staff especially in small cafe on first floor,"Amazing shop with more floors than you can possibly visit in one day but totally unpleasant staff, rude arrogant unhelpful, especially in the small coffee bar on the first floor! Would never visit it again! The cafeteria on the top floor was also way too hot and we left after having been seated 20 minutes with no waiter coming. A lot of room for improvement.",1
Fake insurance,"I made a purchase at the store and activated the household appliance insurance offered. When I had to use it, I was surprised by conditions that were not clear at the time of hiring. I asked for transparency on the replacement value of the product and they refused to provide any proof. Unfortunate the way they handled the client. I do not recommend taking insurance through El Corte Inglés.",1
Tapas Restaurant in Mall,"The mall it self is huge. We stopped at a tapas restaurant on the lower level. We waited in line for 25 minutes to be shown a seat. Once we were seated we did not get served.Three other tables ,which were seated after us , got served. The only difference was the locals get preference. I guess they do not want to serve tourists! It was a Saturday & very busy. Would not advise waiting a long time to be seated , if you won’t get served.",1
Not recommended,Worthless lots of expensive shops. Would not recommend this store. Probably on sale. Shop is very spacious and clean. 0,1
A once-trusted brand is falling apart,"We ordered a De'Longhi coffee machine from Corte Inglês as part of their Black Friday promotions.

We are still waiting almost three months later.

In that time, we've received about 12 emails promising that the coffee machine would be delivered in the next few days.

However, once we started complaining, and raising our complaints to a high enough level, it turns out that these messages are generated by the Corte Ingles system automatically and bear no relation to reality at all.

When we pushed Corte Ingles to check what the situation actually was, it turns out they had no idea when the item would be back in stock. In fact, we were given the advice to ignore emails from Corte Ingles about delivery dates, until we actually receive a message from the courier to confirm that the item is on its way.

The problem is that every time we have received a message, we had to arrange our lives around it, to make sure that one of us would be at home on the given days.

If the key to customer service is to under-promise and over-deliver, Corte Ingles has a system designed to do exactly the opposite.

Every time we've tried to contact Corte Ingles on the phone, it's a painful process that takes a long time, and involves a lot of waiting. And quite often the phone has just cut off, and of course no one calls you back, you have to start again and go through the whole process again. If you need to speak to them in English, then that's a whole another level of pain and waiting.

What is very surprising is to see the coffee machine still being offered on the Corte Ingles website as if it's still in stock!
They're trying to get people to buy and them keep stringing them along with a stream of emails that say things that they know aren't true.

Basically, you can't trust what's on the Corte Ingles website, you can't trust what they send in their emails, and you have to be very patient to get through to people who aren't going to tell you the truth anyway!

What has happened to this brand?!

Never again for us.",1

I thought ! Today 2 September I still find myself waiting for the machine , I contact the assistance say they do not take responsibility and that was sent the delay email ( 10 emails in total ) and 2 months waiting ! They with 160€ and I without the camera! Aserio be careful not to keep your money and still say that you do not take responsibility because you do not know the partnerships with whom you work. unfortunately in my case if this is not resolved soon will take serious proportions in court because I know well my rights as a consumer, and it is the company el corte inglés that gives the face.

Racist Supermarket Staff,"Mamadu Cande arbitrarily let one customer go in front of another at the supermarket checkout line.

I was the next customer at the checkout, I am an Asian woman with 11 items. Mamadu Cande asked me if I would be okay with letting a customer behind me, a White woman in her 30s with 1 item, checkout first.

I said ""No. Why?!"", incredulous. Mamadu Cande grabbed her item from behind mine on the checkout belt, scanned and allowed her to pay first anyway.

It was against my will, illogical, unjustified, unexplained, inexplicable, probably racist and definitely arbitrary.

I complained. Mamadu Cande simply smiled like I was being ridiculous, and gave no explanation. What is the point of queuing if the checkout staff gets to pick and choose who gets to go first? If all customers behind me have only one item, do I ever get to pay and leave?

The other customer was able-bodied and young, did not appear to be in a rush, and did not request to go first. We were not in a 10 item or less checkout line. There was completely no reason for Mamadu Cande to do what he did. I cannot believe this happened at all, and in El Corte Ingles, allegedly the best high end supermarket in Portugal.",2
The food court is not it,"When I went to Spain a few years ago, I had visited El Corte Ingles and loved it. So when I found out they had a location in Lisbon, I definitely wanted to check it out. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't it. Maybe my expectations were set to high because of the Barcelona one (since it is a Spanish store after all), but the Lisbon one was just lacking. The food court was just filled with over-priced restaurants. The Cafeteria was reasonably priced, but none of the menu items appealed to us. There wasn't any Portugues menu items - it was just basic sandwiches, salads, and burgers. Visting the food court was our main reason for coming here so unless you are planning to actually shop here, I'd recommend skipping it.",2
Spectacular merchandise - Pathetic staff.,"I have been to El Corte Ingles in Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon. Typically, I don 't review department stores, but these are really impressive - if you ignore the people who work there and the multiple inefficiencies. The supermarkets are wonderful, but rude staff ruin the experience. Same goes for their eateries upstairs and throughout the store. They do NOT understand any form of customer service, but you may get lucky on any given day. Staff at Lisbon Store are particularly useless.",1
"Attention to dress code, nationality, and ethnicity before going in.","This shopping mall is very interesting, with several branches, and I particularly like it the most. It offers the finest collections of products, and I often visit to check out new items and do grocery shopping or buy souvenirs. Although there are cheaper places, I enjoy the presentation and experience of this location and I highly recommended it (due to the products, only).

However, one day when I was not at my best and dressed casually in jeans, a shirt, and a simple jacket, I noticed that security guards were constantly watching me and my friend. If my friend, who has a darker skin tone than mine, touched any items on display, security would approach us, without saying a word. It was a frustrating experience, and it highlighted the issue of racism and xenophobia.

What's worse, I witnessed another incident where a group of Brazilians were being mocked by a (native) Nescafe machine salesperson nearby. This happened on the upper floors of the mall. Though I can't say why the mocking began, I do not see it as a professional or customer-oriented service attitude.""",2
Forgetful,"Restaurant is at top of the store and I went there after shopping. I had the days special which was Brazilian meat with rice, very bland. Dessert was ok. I was disappointed.",2
"Disappointing - visit local boutiques all around, instead","This collection of shops in an old mansion was recommended by Cabana Magazine. It was very disappointing --lots of spaces empty --and scorching hot inside. Visit all the super, small boutiques in the area (Barrio Alto) instead, where we found lots of great things!",2
Such a beautiful palace / sooo badly managed,"The city palace is beautiful and the shops are exquisite and special. You have to like it...
""However, the employees in the individual shops are so unfriendly and not at all interested in selling anything""
They hardly look up and are busy with their cell phones!",2
"Boutiques de créateurs, trop cher","Lors de notre visite du quartier do principe Real nous nous sommes arrêtés dans la galerie commerciale Embaixada. Celle ci ne contient que des boutiques de créateurs sur 2 étages. Les prix sont nettement très élevés et sans rien proposer de vraiment exceptionnel. Sauf si vous avez les moyens, je déconseille et la galerie et même le quartier qui n'ont pour moi aucun intérêt.",2
"No interest, move on","Found this address in a guidebook. The place is nothing exceptional, the service is non-existent, they don't even know the wines offered, in tasting the wines were not good. 2 glasses, 1 cheese and charcuterie plate 25.-, a tourist trap. I won't go back there.",2
Very very dangerous at night!!!!,"The area is beautiful however it is unbelievably dangerous, especially in the night. There are a lot of intimidating men that loiter/ live on the streets below that are not afraid to approach and follow you - I am a 20 year old young women who moved into an apartment on this street and was there for 3 days before I had no other choice than to move as the area was too dangerous for me to leave past dark!!! I personally know of 2 other women who have had to do the same shortly after moving in.
It is such a shame as the area is really beautiful and the street is in a very central part of the city. Just around the corner are great shops and restaurants and it is completely safe! It seems to be this one square that attracts dangerous individuals. During the day it is fine as it is busy however DO NOT visit if you are a woman and alone when it is night time as you will NOT be safe. Google this street and you will see recent news reports of the crimes that have been occurring at night.",1
Mistreatment at the station,"Terrible treatment at the station's ticket office, the young woman who served us spoke very badly to us, she shouldn't have been facing the public",1
ALERT-train strike affecting schedule throughout the day,"BEWARE—STRIKE THRU APRIL 5, 2023. check the cp.ct website before going to the train station. You can go the the alerts section and get information about which trains are not running. NOTE—The train station will still list your train as running and give you a platform number even though the alert information on the website will tell you which trains are cancelled because of the strike. Only about a half hour before the train departs will the station announce the train has been cancelled. The monitors do NOT show it has been cancelled.

The ticket window is nice and will rebook you, but you will get whatever seats are available and will ride backwards because all the forward seats are gone.

And because of all the cancellations, all the luggage storage at the stations is very limited. So you are stuck waiting at the station unless you want to haul your luggage around or go to another storage facility in Lisbon.

Hopefully some people will see this and avoid the hassles we have had today.

Tip: if you show up to your station and your train is not on the line it should be at least a half hour before you are to depart, go immediately to the ticket window to rebook.",2
Detestable! Bad infrastructure!,"The subject reigns on the spot. The bathrooms are horrible, it's a huge shelter of drugged people harassing passengers and street locals taking all seats. Rolling stairs turned off during peak hours! Day of the week! Thank God there is a shopping area in front, which offers hygiene and safety to train passengers.",1
"It's a very beautiful place, but dirty and dangerous","Just like anywhere else, you need to be careful with your stuff so you don't get robbed. It is very well located, but if during your travel time the shopping Vasco da Gama is open, it is safer to stay there waiting to give your travel time.
If your trip is in hours when the shopping is closed, on the top floor of the East there is a glass room that offers sockets, if you have a seat available it is safer to wait there inside. In the winter sale a lot in the season, and there are not many closed places to protect yourself from the cold, especially in the morning hours.",2
Horrible.,"It's just awful. Dirty, broken stairs, nasty bathrooms, cold, dark and full of scary people.",1
Shameful,"What a shame. So foreign that passes here what do they think of our country?!. Lack of hygiene and everything careless. As for the toilets besides dirty, neither cleaning records are made. If it was in a commercial establishment the AZAE would not forgive but as it is something public can be in this deplorable state.",2
Third world station,"I never expected to find such a depressing resort, especially considering that we were on international trips. It has no docks, you are left on internal streets without ramps and uneven sidewalks. Impossible little bag wheels (throughout the station). Underground full of homeless people sleeping there. Zero cops. Few bars. They close early. Dirty bathrooms. Difficult to find suitable information and signs. A mess.",1
"Despite a beautiful season, it is poorly cared for and with equipment off","Although the architecture is very beautiful, the station is poorly cared for, with rolling stairs off and with a lot of dirt. The train ticket stores were closed (only one was open, with long queues) and the automatic services were out-of-air.",2
Lousy signage and customer service.,"This station is very nice but the signage is appalling all the people who work here are very rude and uncooperative. You have to arrive in time to find one's life by dragging your suitcase everywhere and guess where everything is. Lousy attention! Some screens you can't see, no one to point. They assume everyone knows everything.",2
bad,"it looked beautiful, but when I arrived, it was poorly maintained, rusty, poorly cared for, I felt very scared, I clearly saw people ready to carry out scams, it was also dirty and amazingly, Lisbon is a tourist city, and at Oriente station, there was no escalator working, I went up 3 flights of stairs with my suitcase on my back, I'm 61 years old, but I managed to laugh when I saw a poster saying that the escalators were not working, to save energy!!!!!Just laughing, right!!!",1
Not Organized,"Took the train from Oriente to Coimbra and back for a weekend trip from Lisbon. The station is on the red line to the airport and to downtown, which is convenient. The rest is not very well organized. It is about 5 levels, with trains being on the top, a waiting area on the 4th floor and a mall being below. There is also a homeless camp on the bottom floor of the station.

It is hard to navigate around as up and down escalators are not near one another. Many people had to either lug their luggage up or down stairs without an escalator. There is very little in the way of information and help if you are new to the station. The trains are also always late. Mine was 2 hours late. I talked to my hotel in Coimbra about it and they confirmed the trains from the station are never on time. Nothing much you can do but grin I guess.",2
Bad signage,It may be beautiful but it is very confusing with no signage to indicate where the buses are…destinations etc. Without help it's really confusing and frustrating looking for espressos. I don't want to repeat it and I won't suggest it to passengers who don't know it well,1
Confusão no embarque Flixbus em Lisboa Oriente,"Nunca vi tanta desorganização, confusão quanto o que há na estação Lisboa Oriente da Flixbus. Lixo caindo das lixeiras, tudo muito confuso. Os motoristas foram bem gentis apesar da confusão.",1
Ausência de alguém que cuide da estação Oriente,"Elevadores ( alguns?) fora de serviço
Todas as escadas rolantes do rês do chao para o piso 1 só desciam.
Tive de subir as escadas carregando a minha mala
Porquê isto?",2
Racist experience with ticket teller,"A terrible experience with a teller left our family feeling upset and angry. Portugal - and its people - have been amazing so far. A man asked my husband for his passport, rejected his ID and insisted he walk back to our hotel and get his documents. This was just to board a quick train to Sintra. We did not see anyone else being asked for their IDs. Upsetting but not representative of the people as a whole.",1
A scandal.,Monday in the middle of August all city attractions closed. How do you do it? A city that also lives on tourism... Speechless really.,1
Nonsense rules,"The persecution they do to freelance photographers is a shame. They can't see anyone with a machine bigger than a cell phone who is already trying to come and reprimand the person. As if the photographs took some away from the plants. It would be quality advertising at zero value but the greed of asking €140 plus VAT per hour to photograph in the greenhouses is greater.
I do not recommend.",1
BAD.,Bad...... escape this attraction ... we bought in advance by the site .. and when we arrived at the visitation without any email or prior notice of the points to be visited only 2 were visited because of an event that they were going to make.... a lack of respect and total neglect when we sent the email talking about the occurred.....,1
"Tour long, rude and disrespectful.","Earlier in the day we visited sporting Lisbon and went on to benfica stadium after that. Sporting Lisbon tour was great they divided groups into English and Portuguese which was great. Unfortunately benfica didn’t do the same. This was its downfall! The tour took way too long because of this, we were in there for over 2 and a half hours! We were part of a massive group being led around the stadium the tour spoke in Portuguese first then repeated in English. The majority of the group were Portuguese and to be very honest extremely rude! After the guide had explained everything in Portuguese he then explained in English and because the majority of people had understood the first time they then proceeded to have their own conversations and chat amongst themselves while the tour guide was speaking in English making it extremely difficult for us to hear the tour guide throughout the tour. We had been nothing but respectful throughout and listened when he spoke in Portuguese even though we didn’t understand only to then have the majority of the tour to be very rude and disrespectful to us when he spoke in English. The tour guide did nothing to calm them down or quieten them which only added to our frustration. The pitch was under construction but we went out of season so this was on the cards so not their fault. But overall very long, exhausting, couldn’t hear anything and a little pointless. They need to follow sporting Lisbon clubs lead when it comes to their tours as their tour was miles better and suited everyone involved. This tour at benfica was a shambles. Glad I did it but would never go again.",1
Excellent visit ruined by the scheme of the photographs,"A spectacular visit to the final moment... at the beginning they took photos with parents and children to the end presented 2 products, one book with only the family photo and another with only the child. The goal, make us spend 60€ on 2 photos",1
Revised organisation,"When I arrived at the register, I was told that visits reopened at 5pm. Back at 5pm, I was informed that there were no visits scheduled for that day. No communication on site, very disappointed with the organization. Visited the next day, but one day late due to a lack of communication, although the stadium is very nice",2
"Poor conduct, Animals abused, Overpriced photos","The tour was unfortunately really disappointing.. Real eagles were chained up in the stadium that just can't be done anymore..
At the beginning we took photos which are already sold printed out at totally overpriced prices at the end of the tour.",1
"Unmotivated guide, museum theme missed","Entry to the stadium tour is very poorly organized, visitors had to wait in the pouring rain and then spend another half hour in a drafty room. The guide was completely unmotivated and spoke his text like a robot in two languages. Otherwise, the stations are similar to other stadium tours. The museum is designed quite off topic. The chronological classification with other events in the world takes up a lot of space, just like other sports. The best thing is the great animated film on the 2nd floor, which is really well made.",2
RELEASE THE POOR EAGLES!,"It was an awful experience. The tour itself was poor, and the turist guide was mean and boring.
But the worst part of all was the unnecessary cruelty to the eagles that are displayed on the field. What a nightmare to watch and hear them scream becuade they aren’t happy chained on that place. This made me hate everything about the team and the stadium.",1
Disappointing,"We have been on several stadium tours: Madrid, Barcelona... This one at Benfica was the worst. A herd of 50 tourists is first carelessly herded through the stadium and then into the Benfica shop. The tour was supposed to be in English, but ended up being in both Portuguese and English. It just wasn't good.",1
"Terrible staff, cool stadium.","Believe me when I say I am not a complainer, this is my first ever time writing a review but I felt I had to. Myself and a group of friends did the tour (partly) last weekend. Firstly for context we had a boat trip organized at 12PM so we arrived at the stadium at 10:20 to take the ""1 hour"" tour to leave us enough time.

Tours allegedly leave every 15minutes. Problem number 1, you buy tickets in a completely separate building, when we went to buy the tickets despite there being an abundance of staff it took them 15minutes and no other customers to print our tickets (I kid you not). Then we walked back to the tour entrance where there was a queue of around 10 people. it took this queue another 15minutes to pass because none of the incompetent staff where operating the barrier to let people in. Then the tour didn't start for another 10minutes. So we mentioned to the tour guide that the tour started late so we would need to leave early, could we go and see the pitch and really the only important things any football fans want to see but they ignored us.

Around 30 minutes later when we realized the tour was going to take way to long we asked to have someone take us back to the entrance so we could leave having seen nothing that we wanted to. The female guide was very rude and made it seem like it was our fault that they had wasted 40minuts of our time.

Stadium is cool, staff are truly dreadful.",1
Ridiculous,"In my small way I visited Madison Square Garden and the football stadiums of Barcelona, of
Corinthians, Palmeiras, São Paulo: they all allowed you to visit the home team's changing rooms, but not here!
Why??
I agree with all those who condemn the fact of keeping three eagles miserably prisoners, which they only release for two quick flights before each match.
The ""museum"" is an American nonsense without rhyme or reason: they attempted to mimic the giants of the Stars and Stripes species, simulating the spectator's participation in a match.
You stand on a platform that slowly rises (why?) in front of videos of witty fans.
Pathetic",2
"Long wait, badly organised, poor content, cruelty to animals. Need I say more?","So, decided to do the Benfica Stadium tour for my son's birthday whilst on holiday in Lisbon. Not a good experience. Paid for our tickets and then had to wait 1 hour and 20 mins in blazing sun with no shade to get in.
The tour itself was very poor. I've done a lot of European stadium tours with my football mad sons. In terms of content this was easily the worst. Normally the organisers have thought it through and the script for the tour is full of interesting facts about the stadium, its history and the club in general. Not this one - it was just boring. And once you've paid your money and waited in line they explain that you cant look at the home dressing room (too much of a security risk apparently!) and the pitch side dugouts are boarded up. But my biggest issue is the eagles that permanently live chained up next to the pitch. Seems like the only times they move is to fly about the stadium for the amusement of fans on match day - or to be taken to the club shop for photo opportunities with visitors (for a fee of course). Staggering that this is going on in a major city/club in 2023!",1
Bad organisation plus animal cruelty,"Badly organised at the start of the tour, too many people trying to get in and the staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing. We had pre booked a ‘jump the queue’ ticket but there was no way to access other than queuing in the English or Portuguese line. After nearly 45 mins wait we eventually got on a tour with a guide who seemed pretty disinterested. The real low point was the poor eagles chained up on the pitch which just seemed pointless animal cruelty. The guide made no reference why they were there. Couldn’t wait to leave. I highly recommend skipping the tour and just do the excellent museum if you are a football fan.",1
Stadium tour,"Very quick tour . Not allowed in home team changing room. Staff overall not friendly. Wanted us in and out quickly ,
Felt like we were an inconvenience.",2
COMPRA ENTRADAS EN LAS MÁQUINAS,"Muy mal trato, compramos entradas para ver el campo de fútbol + museo en la tienda de fútbol como nos indicaron y al salir de la tienda, había una máquina donde podías comprar las entradas 5 euros más barato, fui a la tienda a comentar y me dijeron que no tenían nada que ver y que no iban a hacer nada, vergonzoso!",2
1 ESTRELA,gostei muito do estádio e das suas instalações. definitivamente um dos melhores estádios a que já fui. #BENFICAPARASEMPRE,1
Una filosofía que atrasa,"Fui con toda la emoción de visitar un estadio que observaba por televisión y alucinaba conocer y al promediar el estadio tour y ver a un costado del campo de juego a tres Águilas atadas prácticamente sumergidas es sus desperdicios y en su plumas caídas, bajo el sol y el frío, me dio asco. Entiendo que son los animales representativos de la institución pero tenerlos de esa manera atrasa y no hace más que querer comentarles a conocidos y amigos que no visiten un club que, a mi opinión, quedó en el tiempo y maltrata así a una especie salvaje que merece estar en condiciones libres.",1
But why?,"Among the Lisbon derby we had chosen the stadium of Sporting L. A little for ease, a little because more intriguing by the team. It went wrong, I explain: the Stadium is currently a construction site (around) and the reception does not exist, half an hour in a row at the only open counter to discover that the access to the museum and stadium was on the other side, obviously no sign. Line up for your ticket to discover that tours are guided in time blocks only. So we had to wait 3 hours... Too bad because apart from the club shop everything appears left there... So we headed to Benfica Stadium (but that's another story)",1
Weak,"Very weak and short exposition, with many texts in Brazilian Portuguese, and with spelling errors. €10 is expensive for the experience",2
"Don't go, read an anatomy book","Poor exposition, with a lack of explanations, with subtitles that they forgot to translate into Portuguese. Most of the organs on display only have the name of the organ, they are often a group of organs and anyone who doesn't know them doesn't know what they are looking at. It's better to buy a good anatomy book, the results are much better. This exhibition is just a 3D anatomy book. I saw the same exhibition about 15 or 16 years ago and it was much better. Larger, it presented sections of the organs with an explanation of what was being seen, comparing the healthy organ with a diseased organ. In the current exhibition we have the organs with just their name and explanation on a board. There you go, you might as well read an anatomy book. I do not recommend. Not worth the ticket price. Unless you really want to see real bodies (which, after the necessary treatment so they don't get damaged, don't even look real, so it's easy for people to forget that)",1
Not work the cheaper price. Get a direct flight and a better tour guide from somev other company.,"The price of the tour is cheaper because the fight are horrendous. 3 flights is too much, and the layovers were brutally short. Terrible setup.
Our guide for the coastal cities must have been very new at his job as he was not very good at it. A terrible story teller with no real point to his stories. He didn't check on people at the back half of the bus. I think he hoped most people were tired and wanted to sleep in the bus trips. The country is great. The tour guide was not.",2
One more frustration to add,"Just meant to add to my previous reviews:
Imagine you have prepaid events or excursions and, you have NO idea about the start time or duration !! Tell me how can you plan any limited daily remaining time!!
we traveled as far as Australia..
NEVER seen any services as such..",2
Are they in business?,I don't believe they are still in business as there was no communication from them when I tried several forms of contact.,1
Scam,"We paid in full via the company's website, but after starting the trip, the driver started asking for more money. I don't know if that's only him or his company trying to scam people, but that was a very poor experience.
He threatened to go get his manager, we told him to do so, and he finally relented and everything was ""good"".",1
Unreliable,Very disappointed! They canceled the day before the tour because they did not plan ahead properly for Carnival in Portugal.,1
There was no show,"We were really excited for the fado show and had made a confirmed reservation via email. Upon arrival the place was closed and multiple other people were waiting outside for the show. Nobody answered when ringing the bell, and when calling the phone number they only told us that ""there is no fado in the box"". We would have appreciated a simple notification for a cancellation of the show. It ruined our evening.",1
Fado un chiado,"It's not worth the detour for a 45-minute show in an auditorium. There were 4 of them, the show was in a shopping center. I don't recommend it",2
Nice place but weak singers,"The location and place is nice. Guitarist are good, but the singers are very weak. Both singers lack passion and could not connect with us/audience. Some people left before the show ended including us. I heard Fado is all about the singer passion and how they make you feel the lyrics. We didn’t experience that, for that reason I don’t recommend it.",1
Not the spirit of real Fado,Unfortunately the artists change it like an American musical. There is none of the spirit and emotion of Fado at all. We were very disappointed.,2
Go to the Alfama neighborhood for an authentic experience...,"Despite the singers being very talented, the experience as a whole felt very fabricated and inauthentic. If you want a more authentic Fado experience – go to the Alfama neighborhood and choose a Fado restaurant where you will pay the same price (or less) and have your dinner included.",2
Disappointing,This is the second time I came here - when I visited in 2022 it was beautiful. This time there were too many damages caused by tagging and by a lack of maintenance. I didn’t bother to take a photo this year because the damage was too extensive.,1
Restaurant visit instead of described food tour,"The tour does not match the description and we advise against booking it. You only visit one restaurant where you can get 3 tapas and 3 wines. So you sit at the table with the guide and chat. The so-called tour lasts a good hour.
It was not carried out by the booked provider, but was apparently passed on to the provider Discover Lisbon. On their website the tour is also described as carried out and is offered at a 20% discount.
One positive thing to note is that the guide was very friendly and informative. The food was very good and the restaurant owner told us a lot of interesting information about Portuguese winemaking.",2
A bewildering array of tat,"A long trek up a hill to what can best be described as a very low end car boot sale. On one stall we spotted some dusty packets of condoms alongside a very old computer keyboard and on another what appeared to be lots of old photos of random people and on another lots of half empty shower gels and sun tan lotion.
Solves the mystery of where that stuff that gets left behind in villas and hotels ends up……
Just utter rubbish - save your energy and visit one of the very many local boutiques dotted around instead.",1
"Hot, crowded, not much to discover!","Very disappointing -- mostly junk, crowded and not worth it. Also scalding hot in June! Visit local boutiques around the city, instead.",1
More like a car boot,"Don’t bother climbing up the hills to get to this flea market. It’s more or less a car boot sale and a very poor one at that.
The only positive about this flea market is they have public toilets available",1
Fair,We have gone to several fairs within Portugal and Europe and this does not reach the level of them. It measures about two blocks and the prices are quite high compared to others.,2
"As a kid, he often went here to sell what he no longer used.","Once again I went back to Feira da Ladra, as a kid I often went here to sell what I no longer used.
Nothing to do with the traditional thief fair of Lisbon from old and that is now much better.
Remember that movement very early to set up the tent, I do not agree with the fact that I have finished with those occasional sales (where I included myself rsrsr).Now we see mostly people looking for pechinches. One or another buys an item that you may miss (this is what happened to me this time), also collectors and antiques dealers
The market in the middle of it, which used to be...
It was nice to remember but at the same time I came with a bitterness and sadness, because it has nothing to do with Fair of the thief of old.",2
It's no longer the same thing,"It's no longer the same thing... A few years ago, we had such a variety...choice of unusual items, rarities...we managed to buy good items for almost nothing. Today we find store prices for items from a garage sale..",2
trinket fair,"Traditional Flea Market in Lisbon.
Easy access from Santa Apolônia station.
I went on a Tuesday.
Many products are used and old. I won't be back.",2
Don’t bother going,"What a waste of time going to this place. Looked like everyone was selling their long dead relatives stuff from the loft, or tacky souvenirs. Do not bother going. Went mid week if that makes a difference.",1
Dusty and Gross,Dump out your dead neighborhood hoarders junk drawer i went here my first morning and whew not worth the walk I saw a real market in Belem outside the mosteiro de jeronimo,1
Nice to see once but no desire to return.,"Weather very nice, architecture mainly unremarkable but endless very narrow streets were quaint and enjoyable. Trams were a lovely experience but very disappointing due to being put off by the driver several times, e.g. accidents blocking the route ahead and journey over; HUGE queues at start of route 28; 1 1/4 hour wait and then put off after 5 minutes, or tram not arriving at all; or put off soon after boarding as we boarded unknowingly near the terminus where you must disembark again, and then join yet another queue... New tram out to Belem etc fine but not as nice. Lot of young men (18-40yrs aprx) hanging around day and night with little to do, sometimes intimidating when they stare at you (thankfully we had no crime issues). All unemployed? Footpaths and steps (of which there are many) poorly maintained and frequently dangerous. Endless graffiti lowers the tone. Openly offered cocaine etc on Avenue da Liberdade by some of the aforementioned males with no sign of police. Metro and buses worked well, especially to/from airport. We took a tuktuk tour on last day which turned out excellent. Glad to have visited but in no hurry to return.",2
Terrible Experience – Avoid at All Costs!,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This company left us stranded at the airport with four small children after a long 10 hour flight, despite having booked our transfer weeks in advance.

The night before our arrival, I received a sudden message from Booking.com stating there was an ""unexpected problem with the transfer."" This company was the supplier of booking.com for our transfer. With no time to make alternative arrangements, we landed hoping the issue could be resolved. I called the company, but they claimed nothing could be done since transfers must be booked at least 8 hours in advance.

To my surprise, the driver and his boss were actually at the airport. The boss called Booking.com, pretending to investigate, but I later confirmed that they were the ones who canceled the ride themselves. When I asked if they could still take us, they said yes—but only if we paid an extra 20€ in cash. While I went to withdraw the money, my wife stayed with them. When she pointed out that by taking cash, they could avoid paying commission, the boss became angry and refused to take us at all, leaving us completely stranded.

This was beyond unprofessional—it was a deliberate scam. Instead of honoring the booking, they canceled last minute to force us into a direct cash deal, and when confronted, they simply abandoned us.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this company and their shady supplier, Filipe Mateus Tours in Lisbon. Absolutely unacceptable.",1
Great tour cost but make sure you define your tour agenda.,"They made a wrong assumption and elected not to take us to a location we paid for. Enjoyed the driver and the locations we did visit but when a contract states the cities we will visit, an assumption was made and we didn’t visit one location.",2
,"The worst bus line by far. Second time I try flixbus, second issue.

Apparently the bus broke down, they changed to a different one, different brand (gypsy bus) different location in the bus station.

Neither the website nor the app notified this. We were in the bus station, but we missed the bus.",1
Most impolite drivers ever who are even willing to run over your children with their bus!,"I really think Flixbus only hires you as a driver if you have no sense of customer service at all and are just rude and impolite. Not even a hello from the driver, no help at all. And when I reached my destination and got out of the bus I was getting my suitcase out of the bus with my 4 year old and 8 year old. Another bus came up and apparantely my kids were standing at the end of the parking spot where the bus had to park. Ok sir, my bad, but how the hell dare you to drive your bus forward while honking and making hand movements with a mad face without giving the kids a moment to go stand somewhere else! Still very upset and mad about the experience and I really cannot understand why Flixbus doesn't do anything about the behavior of their drivers! Especially since there are so many bad reviews online.",1
A DISASTER!!!! NO LO COJAIS,"A FLYBUS disaster!!!!! I took it to travel to the night of the Intermodal from Bilbao to Lisbon. I'm 2 hours late and we weren't told anything. I was alone at 2:00 in the morning not knowing what to do but the worst came later. I had paid for a seat to go more comfortable and found a man lying sleeping in my square. The driver did nothing, there were even people sleeping in the hallway. All dirty, there was vomit everywhere, Third World.",1
Bad trip Paris/ Viseu,"I do not recommend. The experience was terrible.
The trip from Paris to Viseu started 1h late because there is no organization or coordination
No check in. We were told that the bathroom of the bus was broken down, we had to subject it to the stops.
At the stop of the city of Guarda (previously Celorico da Beira) the new driver warned that he should only leave the same person who was going to change bus, (he spoke only in Portuguese). A foreign gentleman left because he wanted to go to the bathroom. Despite the warnings of some passengers, the driver ran off and left this gentleman to his luck, saying it was for him to learn. It was a very boring and difficult to understand situation. Next we made a stop in Celorico da Beira for lunch, 40 minutes.
A foreign passenger gets abandoned to his luck because the bus was late (this delay was from the company). After a lot of our insistence, they communicated to the company and said that they would resolve the situation of such a passenger. Let's believe it. Finally, in Celorico da Beira we were told that the bathroom of the bus was working.
Cheap comes expensive, medium service.",1
Driver using mobile phone,"We felt very unsafe! The driver was on his mobile phone on and off throughout the trip. Answering calls, texting, at times his hands were not even on the wheel while using his phone, so very dangerous and illegal. I will never use flu bus again and will advise anyone who asks me not to use. I put on a complaint and have had no reply. I’m afraid a terrible tragedy will happen if these drivers are not reprimanded.",1
Flixbus is a scam!,"We booked a return ticket from Lisboa Oriente to Caldas and arrived 20 min ahead, at line 1017, quai 37. We talked to all bus drivers who stopped there, they told us to wait. Other passengers also waited. The bus didn't come, all of us contacted help line, all of us were cut down arrogantly and told we were wrong. A mix of foreigners and Portuguese complained. Non of us got reimbursed, some of the passengers were very poor. May flixbus go to hell!",1
"Poor maintenance, cleaning, stressed drivers, no eating, no drinking","The overall impression of Flix Bus is poor, you would like to pay 20% more if the quality were right.

Dirty, unfriendly, poorly maintained, and the drivers have a very unpleasant, stressful driving style due to their negative energy.

The train stations and bus stops in Portugal are also littered and smell of urine, but Flixbus is not solely to blame.

- No food and no drinking allowed, even no nuts etc.

- countless cracks and stone chips in the windshield - there is a lack of maintenance and repair.

- Expired inspection of fire extinguishers 05/25 in June.

Elderly couple left behind at rest stop,"We travelled by Flixbus from Lisbon Airport to Porto with a rest stop along the way. The driver did not speak any English, he was shouting and yelling right from the start and the only thing I heard was ""10 minutes"" and some kind of stern warning. I took that to mean I had to be fast at the rest stop.
We did stop and then quickly got back on board when about ten minutes down the road I noticed the elderly couple to my left had not got back on the bus. All their belongings were on their seat but not them. I went up to the front of the bus to tell the driver please turn around or call the Colibri stop where we left them. He was abusive, there were a few people at the front who translated as the driver spoke no English. I felt quite distraught at the thought of leaving those elderly folks behind and all their belongings and suitcases still on the bus. Could he even call back to make sure they were OK? The driver basically told me to shut up and get off the bus in Porto, when I again pleaded with him. What if they needed medication or their phones, and how will they get to Porto? It was by far the worst experience I have ever had, the most uncaring driver I have ever encountered and it took days not to feel that I had abandoned two elderly people. My only hope was that having since met many lovely and kind people in Portugal someone must have helped them. I have a sense this driver may not have been Portuguese. Be warned the abuse of this particular driver and his uncaring attitude has continued to stay with me long after my trip to Portugal is over.",1
Passenger comfort is replaced by profit for the company,"Bad experience in terms of comfort. The number of seats in the bus is increased in order to increase the profit of the company, proportionately reducing the comfort of passengers who are limited to places with no leg space, especially when some passenger with little concern for the comfort of others decides to tilt their backbone backwards. The low price does not compensate for the lack of comfort on long trips. I do not recommend.",1
Misinformation,"I had to take the bus from Faro to Lisbon, and although I informed that I had to take it at the Faro bus station, the exit of it did not appear on any screen, and where they sell the tickets do not give information about Flixbus (they have a sign where they expressly clarify)...I ended up being helped by the girl who attends the cafeteria of the stations, who pointed out that somewhere where the buses park before departure, I was going to find it. Luckily, I had arrived in advance of the departure time of the bus to Lisbon, otherwise while searching the entire terminal from where the Flix buses were leaving, I would have missed it SURE!!!!
In this case the problem is both the terminal and Flix that do not clearly report the irregular situation in the same...
To top it off, I then had to deal with the bad modes of the driver, who had trouble for 3 seconds trying to read the QR code, and not register it. Very bad experience that could have ended worse!!!",1
Pretty bad,The drivers are very arrogant and does not respect him nobody did the trip trucks they just want to stop and have some business with the cafes very bad,1
"Long haul with Flixbus, never again !!!!","We booked Flixbus from Torres Vedras (Portugal) to Lisbon (Oriente) and then connected with Flixbus from Lisbon (Oriente) to Madrid. The bus from Torres Vedras to Lisbon (1 hour) was great. HOWEVER, the bus from Lisbon to Madrid (8 hours) on 5 June was terrible. Legroom worse than the cheapest airline economy seat. Broken aircon vents, broken overhead bins, people drinking alcohol on bus, disinterested driver. We booked a return with Flixbus but opted to book a flight back to Lisbon with Easyjet. Long haul with Flixbus, never again !!!",1
Double payment without tickets,"I made the payment in the respective application, made a mistake but the payment was debited, twice. I await feedback as they make the return, considering that there is no customer support phone contact, the same is done via a chat platform. I have already written via chat with 4 people and so far have not solved anything.",1
Worst Bus Ride of My Life,"One of the worst experiences I've ever been through while traveling. I did research ahead of time and saw that Flixbuses had restrooms, allowed food, and/or sold food on the bus. Sadly, I did not read the reviews.

We got our tickets for a 6 hour bus ride from Coimbra to Lagos. When we got to the bus, it was chaos. The bus drivers weren't helpful when we were loading our suitcases and were not friendly at all, and gave little direction on where to put them.

When we got on the bus, we saw a sign that said no eating or drinking, and when asked if there were restrooms on the bus, we were told no. The bus drivers even joked in Portuguese saying ""what, next they will ask if there are beds, too."" They didn't know that my husband could understand them.

Our 1st stop was to pick up more passengers (this was 30 minutes after we left). We asked to get off the bus to use the restroom and were told no that there was no time, that we'd only be there for a few minutes and that the next stop would be in an hour. Although they said it would be quick, they ended up taking 30 minutes to pick up the passengers. We could have quickly went to the restrooms but weren't permitted.

Once we left, about 30 minutes passed and we desperately had to use the restrooms. The driver's assistant was rude and said it would be a half an hour more. I told him I was going to be sick and had to use the restroom urgently. He told the driver, who stopped 10 minutes later to allow just those in our party to go to the restroom (noone else was allowed to get off the bus).

Once we got back on the bus, we didn't stop again until 1.5 hours later, even though we were originally told it would be an hour for our 1st stop (it ended up being 2 hours!).

The bus driver had his phone discreetly hidden on his left side so he could watch the football game during the drive. I have video and photos to prove this.

We made the BIG mistake of not reading reviews before we took this bus trip.
NEVER AGAIN!",1
Ruined,"Wish I could give 0 stars. I’ve used this service multiple times and had good experiences but the drivers I had on Friday May 30 from Lagos to Lisbon at about midday has absolutely made sure I will never give my money to this company ever again. These boys should be fired, that’s the end of it. Entitlement. Mistreatment if I’ve ever seen it",1

The AC wasnt working properly ..only hot air
it was very hot
everyone was sweating

worst experience ever",1
AVOID FLIXBUS IF YOU CAN,"I took the bus Lisbon to A Coruña, we had to swap busses in Porto. The bus got there a bit late so we only had 20 or 25 minutes to change. I decided against going to the bathroom because it's on the top floor and there's usually a queue, just so I wouldnt miss the bus. I stayed for the entire time at the platform the screen was saying my bus would leave from. It never showed up. All of the sudden a few muntes after the time the screen started to show a different destination from the same platform. I then went to information and they said the bus left without me, from that platform. The wouldn't believe me when I said it didn't, I was there the entire time, the bus is bright green, there's no way I would had missed that. I had to buy a new trip and wait for 2 hours. The never took responsability.",1
Worst bus experience,"5 booked trips none was possible to go in shame on this Flixbus …
Assistance is horrible and with this guys impossible to have your money back if something goes wrong 👎👎👎",1
Don't waste your money & upfront seats,"payed for front row seat . Then another Flixbus driver sat next to me & continually talked to the driver . Rows 2ab&3ab were empty. Why should I pay for a front row seat to have another person who hasn't payed for the front row seat & Flixbus employee. I asked the driver to move to the other empty seats as he was distracted driver because he was continually talking to the driver. He refused so I had to move to an empty row so I could have a RELAXING trip .
Cost be €4.95 , save your money",1
Just stay away from FLIXBUS.,"Just stay away from this miserable transportation company, traveling from Lisboa to Lagos, first of all the bus was late one hour then two buses 🚌 cam at the same time. Full time chaos when people was not directed to the correct bus and loaded their bags in the wrong one. When entering the bus the toilet was out of order imagine a three hour long ride without a chance to to on the toilet.",1
Delayed without notice,"Very complicated if something goes out of schedule! I have traveled more times in this company and never had problems. This time, they delayed the journey an hour, they notified by message. When we arrived at the new scheduled time the bus had already left half an hour ago, we were not warned nor even compensated for it! We had q wait more than 4 hours during the dawn and pay new tickets.
Without any kind of care with the customer",1
With great ease they abandon their passengers on the highway,"Lisbon port of 27/04/2025 at 10:45 am line 1004, Bus full. The toilet, according to the driver, was out of order and locked. At 10:40 a passenger who had an urge found the toilet door closed, asked the driver if, given the disruption, he could go to the terminal toilet possibly delaying the departure by a few minutes in case he could not get back by 10.45. The driver with intransigence said no. The passenger remained in the car with his discomfort. In the end, however, the bus left 10 minutes late.

At 2/3 of the way, after numerous requests from other passengers, the bus made a stop at the motorway.
Some passengers stayed in the car, others like me and my wife got out to stretch a little 'but remaining in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, others reached the services of the Grill car.
After a few minutes while getting back in the car my wife screamed because the door was closing and had to back off. I pushed the door from the inside with my foot, managing to open it and let my wife back in. Then the door closed again. The other passengers still on the ground who witnessed the scene ran towards the bus agitating to have the doors reopened. After a few moments of hesitation the driver reopened the doors and let them in. then closed again and left. Two other passengers left on the ground ran to cross the bus route and scrambled to make it stop. The driver accelerated and passed the two boys who had arrived less than five from the bus leaving them in the motorway without their luggage.
I counted the empty seats and there were more than 10.

Once on the highway one person went to complain to the driver because his fellow travelers had been left on the ground. Then the driver stopped in the emergency lane where he abandoned that person who got out with his and other backpacks
The bus started again as if everything were normal.

Once they arrived in Porto and got off all clearly several checked bags were not collected.",1
Refund after 1h30 delay,If you have scheduled or appointment do not go with this company. They're not punctual. And only refunds after waiting 1h30,1
GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND CAUSE OF ANXIETY,"I tried booking Lisbon to Evora 4 times before one of my credit cards was accepted. Flixbus advertised that there would be a toilet on the bus - but there was none. I tried to get SMS updates from Flixbus but found that my country (Israel) was not not recognized - so I could not get the service. To return, I tried many times to book a return ticket - but the Flixbus website did not work. So returned on a competitor's bus service.",1
Driver on his mobile phone without hands-free,"We were appalled that the very unfriendly FlixBus driver from Lisbon to Porto was chatting on his mobile phone without using hands-free or Bluetooth whilst driving through the city - same again before reaching Porto. Not only is it illegal to do so, it also puts the safety of all the passengers at risk!!",1
No só good,Driver is very rude and agressive and main thing no toilet even if you are in an emergency you can do nothing.If you have any Health problem then dont travel from Flix bus,1
Don’t do it,"Dismal incorrect advertising by Flix bus The bus itself was very good with good seats, decent legroom a small luggage rack for coats BUT the website states ALL flix bus have toilets and that you can eat on them I booked a return ticket to Lisbon from Armacao because of the toilet as I am on a chemotherapy drug meaning I MUST have access to a toilet in a reasonable time There was nothing wrong with the toilet on the bus it was locked because they don’t want to clean them This was both ways of our trip Our driver had to stop for me at a truck stop gas station to use a toilet that I barely made it to and then felt terrible he needed to stop This was supposed to be a treat to get out for me and why I booked this bus so please Do not book or check they actually have an OPEN toilet Also we purchased a small sandwich and drink and fruit to eat and were told nothing foodie on the bus but saw others just sneak it on and eat it anyways GRRRR Flix bus pull up your socks children, elderly and people shouldn’t need to wait three hours for a toilet",1
Flix lies,"Flix bus advertises that their coaches have restrooms. That is not always true. My Portimao to Lisbon trip (3 hours 20 minutes) had no bathroom. Also Flix website says you can eat on the bus.... When I got on the bus I had a bag of nuts. The driver aggressively told me (zero politeness) that food was not permitted. So Flix gets the lowest possible rating for telling blatant lies in their online marketing. Also, their seating is cramped and uncomfortable. Recommendation to all, take the train.",1
Lousy.,"Journey from Lisbon to Madrid, 9h, from the beginning they took our food they said that if we wanted to eat we would eat it in 5min or if we didn't have to leave it down where the bags, after this at no time of the trip made stop to eat something or to rest, abysmal service, all the hungry passengers and nothing did, I DON'T RECOMMEND",1
Péssimo,"Muito insatisfeita com o serviço da flixbus. Na viagem de ida (Lisboa —> Porto) o motorista não foi nada agradável, ficámos parados imenso tempo no aeroporto, e portanto, chegámos ao destino 40min depois. Disse que a casa de banho do autocarro ia estar fechada, e que pararíamos em Leiria, no entanto, o wc do autocarro aparece como um serviço incluído quando compramos o bilhete. Na viagem de volta, o motorista disse que não ia haver nem uma única paragem, numa viagem de 3horas e 15min. Completamente ridículo pensar que em 3 horas e 15min, mais uns minutos de atraso, ninguém vai ter vontade de ir ao wc, seja por que motivo for. Só me restou aguentar a vontade durante este tempo todo. Não volto a utilizar mais este serviço.",1
Péssimo serviço,"Aproximei a plataforma 39D na Gare de Oriente, pois era a terminal para subir o meu autocarro até campanha. Fiz o scann do Bilhete o código não leu, o motorista disse que não era o autocarro, perguntei com muito respeito se podia me ajudar, pq o bilhete indicava à plataforma aonde o autocarro estava, ele disse não sei o Senhor deve procurar o seu autocarro. Afastei-me para ver a informação do autocarro que passa encima do vidro frontal, era destino Porto-Campanha, voltei a fila lhe mostrei novamente o mesmo bilhete, para fazer o scann, Ele voltou a questionar se não sabia ler, esse não trabalho dele, começou a exaltar a voz. No final diz o seu atutocarro, ia sair às 9:30 e o que estava ali era das 9h.
Depois de tanta estupidez.

Quer dizer nós pagamos os serviços da Flexibus, para sermos distratados ? Parecia que estava a fazer-me um favor dar me informação. Muito arrogante e estupido, logo pela manhã já atende as pessoas com essa estupidez e frieza e mau humor. A matrícula do autocarro é 76XA22, saiu do oriente com destino ao Porto(Campanha), as 9h de hoje dia 22.02 na plataforma 39D

Never again!,"The driver drove like a maniac; tailgating cars, speeding, flashing his lights so other drivers would get out of the way.

"Lousy service,",I don't buy it again after 3 hours waiting they leave me at 3 a.m. on the ground by mistake on date. Early morning 😪😪😪😪😪😪 at Porto airport.,1
POOR COMPANY,"On 28/12/2024, I arrived at the pick-up point indicated on the ticket (3220486451) at 02h00, 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time. However, the bus did not pick up passengers at the specified location. I, along with five other passengers, waited until 3:30 p.m., initially assuming it was a delay. After checking the location of the bus on the company’s website, we found that it was already on its way to Braga, completely ignoring the pickup at the point indicated. It is important to emphasize that the pick-up point is properly marked and indicated on the site (east gate), there is no room for errors about the location because everything is very well marked. Since the next bus to Braga would only depart at 07:00, I was forced to purchase another ticket to Porto at 04:00 (reserve 3220504338) with arrival at 07:25 and another ticket to Porto-Braga (reserve 3220508361) with departure at 08:45 and arrival at 09:55, incurring additional costs and waiting times. When I approached the driver of this bus for clarification, I was informed that the driver responsible for the pickup failure did not belong to Flixbus, having grossly cut the conversation indicating that the driver who should have stopped did not belong to the company since they are all subcontractors. Immediately during the trip I requested the refund through the company’s website (a form intentionally difficult to find to prevent customers from asking for refund) explaining what happened, including adding the name and email of 2 more passengers who were with me and who were in the same situation. Heis that on the same day 28/12 at 13:27 (incredibly quick to investigate the success but completely incompetent to solve) the company responds to me as follows:

Protocol N°42411012
In analyzing the attached reservation, I was able to verify that no delays were reported and passengers embarked on the journey. So that we can begin the analysis of your case, we need evidence of the reporting delay. We await your reply!
With my best compliments,
DJHENYPHER da FlixBus

In the form I filled out to explain what happened, I never mentioned any ""delay"", the driver never passed through the pick-up point even.

When calling the company’s customer service line for the refund line, the assistant says they can do nothing. I called another assistant again and the conversation was the same. I asked to talk to your supervisor and she answers that it's not possible. I asked for your full name to make a complaint about your rough care and it didn't provide me. I requested the employee number or email and also did not provide.

It should be noted that all the employees with whom I had contact from this company, from telephone assistants and drivers, all have the same standard; they are all of Brazilian nationality, (nothing against even because I am Brazilian too) but were all without exception poorly educated, poorly trained, rude, all speak in a tone that more seems to be asleep and of such ignorance that makes any customer lose his calm.

This undertaking should be duly audited and supervised by the competent bodies.

I do not recommend this company to anyone. Even with 2 more witnesses in the same situation as me, with their name and email still need evidence of how the driver did not stop at the point indicated on the ticket. Fortunately I have audio recordings that show the total lack of professionalism of the customer service line. I advise all who use this line to record the conversation because although they also record, they will never provide the audio if requested.

I advise all those who are hurt by this company to preeencher the online complaint book and to initiate a trial in the Peace courts as I myself will do, it is free. Not just for the €21 I lost, but for this company to be properly monitored, as well as all its employees. And as it is obvious I will demand compensation for all the trouble and extra expenses I have had.",1
Poor customer service,"I recently purchased a round-trip ticket on Flixbus to leave from Lisbon Oriente to Fatima and back. I arrived at the stated platform on my ticket 30 minutes before the bus departure intentionally to navigate my way around the station and the platforms since it was my 1st time in Lisbon and 1st time using Flixbus. I found the designated platform and waited there during this time. The slot at the designated platform was also unoccupied. I noticed there was no bus at departure time. I found another Flixbus driver who informed me I had just missed my bus and that it left from a different platform. I attempted to get assistance from the Flixbus chat on my phone which was not very helpful. I ended up purchasing another ticket for the next bus (person on chat advised that bus was sold out when it wasn't). I've written to Flixbus customer service requesting a refund for the new ticket I ended up purchasing since now I had basically bought 2 tickets from Lisbon Oriente to Fatima and only used one. Their response was basically that the bus left on time and from the designated platform, so I'm not entitled to a refund. Not sure how they can insist on that when I was actually there, and another bus driver confirmed the different platform. Don't appreciate that Flixbus customer service is implying that I am lying. Will definitely be looking at other bus options in the future. Everything else about my trip was great - just that it is now overshadowed by this experience with Flixbus poor customer service.",1
Very poor,"I went from Cascais to Porto and back. Bus on time and up here ok.

On the way driver very rude, no wifi, seats smashed, bathroom out of service so stop after two hours of travel.

On the return same situation, but working bathroom (and disgustingly dirty) so I travel more than four hours nonstop

I don't think they'll see me again.",2
Watch your suitcase!!!,"Starting because when we bought the ticket every 10 minutes it raised the price, the experience was unfortunate as our bag was stolen in the terminal of Oriente Lisbon. The driver has no helper and when validating all tickets the area of the bus where the bags are located is completely open from side to side. We noticed when we got to Porto.
The person from flixbus showed 0 empathy just told us filled out the form, here we are still waiting for some response 🤡 We went to the police to report and were told that there are several cases and apparently it is common in orient. Please only 1 person can not have control of that.",1
Appalling driver and company!,"Absolutely appalling!
Went from Albuferia to Lisbon on a 3 hour journey.
Washrooms were out of service, no notice to us until we got onto the bus. The driver said only one stop half way through the journey. I had to uriate 45 minutes into the journey, couldn’t hold it any longer, driver wouldn’t stop, told me to deal with it, I had to urinate on the bottom side steps. I was embarrassed and shaking. Discussing!!",1
I'm not using flixbus again.,"They promoted the toilet on the site but there was no access to the toilet. I had to wait 1:30 to get access to one.

I prefer to pay more and choose another company with more conditions.",2
Autista scortese e scorretto,"I'm traveling from Cascais to Albufeira the heating is broken it's freezing.

I caught a Flix in Lisbon to San Sebastien and immediately started the trip badly when the driver told me that the seats were not marked, were free.Question:why buy tickets and come there written the number instead of free?!On the return was the same.They are fooling the customer,if I knew about it would take the Express Network.I point this review as weak,for lack of seat marking,because the drivers were super competent in driving and in contact with the customer.They lost a customer or if they did not lose it is because probably there will be no one to operate the destination to choose,but you can be sure that they will always be the last option.",2
Worst Bus Company I've Dealt With,"I had to cancel my trip from Porto to London and fly instead. I did so within the time period to receive a 50% refund. Instead of refunding me however they gave me a voucher. When I cancelled my trip their website didn't give me the option of a refund, only a voucher so I had to select this to cancel my trip. You have to then apply for a refund instead of a voucher which they declined since ""we cannot provide a cashback refund for any balance on a voucher."" I explained in an email that their website didn't give me the option for a cashback refund. They clearly didn't even read my email since they replied with the same nonsense. Keeping in mind I lost 140 euros to this company, 70 being the 50% refund that I am owed. I live on the other side of the world where we don't have flixbus so this voucher is useless to me. I highly advise you use another bus company or just fly. Utterly disgusted in the ""service"" I've received from flixbus.",1
DUTY COMPANY,"I lost two buses from Faro to Lisbon due to the poor location of the departure point, difficult access, the maps do not recognize the place and there is no one to inform.. The company does NOT reimburse tickets that I did not use and is not responsible for my loss. FLIXBUS IS A VERY DUBIOUS COMPANY AND WITHOUT ANY TRANSPARENCY AVOID USING ITS SERVICES!",1
Very very very Unreliable,"This is the most unreliable and dishonest bus service provider ever. I have recently booked a trip from Lisbon to Porto on 16 Sep 2024 at 1.20pm. At 1.20 pm sharp only did the company texted me to inform about the bus cancellation. I proceeded with rescheduling the trip for a later time on the same day and was cancelled again 30 minutes later. When I finally got another schedule at 5.30pm, this too was cancelled last minute at 4.51pm. When I asked for a refund, I could only get a voucher for the same company. I contacted the customer service. I was told that I couldn't get a monetary refund as the cancellation was done from my side ( I requested for a refund on the website but I also had return tickets in the same booking which have to be cancelled). The customer service is also less than helpful. How am I to trust the this company again for such a dishonest service? Not only is my money wasted but my precious time is all down the drain. I had to make last minute arrangement for my travel to Porto which was extremely inconvenient and pricey. Please, for your own mental health and time sake, do not engage with Flixbus for any of your travel needs.",1
Missed bus,"So iwas goinh from lagos to lisbon, the bus wasnt picking up from where it supposed to pick up and i missed it, when i tried getting a refund they said they cant do anything, not even a voucher for the next ride, if you can, avoid this company",1
Albuferia to Lisbon.,Booked 1a 1b and a total waste of money as your feet were against a panel and minimal legroom. Going out marginally better with good ac but coming back horrendous and the driver held a social conversation for 45 minutes travelling at 100kmh not hands free .Would never use again as their is an accident waiting to happen. Toilets not working sign displayed which I suspect is a lie as the driver doesn't want to clean them out .Bus station is 5k from scenic Lisbon so you need to get a bolt or uber .,2
Not very nice,"I travelled with my son with 5 years old, from Lisbon to Vila Nova de Mil Fontes, no wc, broken sit and no Internet, all the conditions described on the ticket as conditions included on the service, comnfort, wc and Internet…good thing I arrived at the destination safe.",1
Flixibus Lisbone - Porto do not use it!!!,"We buy tickets from Lisbon to Porto direct departing from the Oriente terminal.
When we bought the ticket it said the bus had wc, wifi and air conditioning.
1 hour before the trip we received an email saying that due to ""technical problems"" the bus had no toilet.
Once on the bus, the air conditioning never worked properly. Personally and other travelers went to ask the driver to please turn on the air conditioning as the bus is closed airtight and without air the atmosphere was not only heavy but very hot, the driver seemed not to understand the request of the travelers.
Wi-fi service: never had internet.
In short, do not take this bus line. It is false what they announce.
If you have the opportunity I used another service.
This Flixibus service I do not recommend.",1
FALSE IN SERVICE- DISCONSULTS THE FLIXBUS SERVICE,"On August 17, 2024, in Castelo Branco, Portugal, at 16:05 the bus simply did not show up
On this day, a group of passengers, including several children, were waiting for the bus scheduled for 16.05. However, he did not show up at the road station, leaving us exposed to extreme weather conditions, with temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius. The bus arrived only at 5:43, but this was the vehicle scheduled for 5:25. The driver refused to give priority to the passengers who had been waiting for almost two hours and informed us that the driver of the bus at 16:05 had felt bad but that he would be coming soon.
Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After more than two hours of waiting and without any kind of support or guidance from FlixBus, we were forced to look for alternatives to continue with our journey. I also point out that the Portuguese customer support line was not available to provide any assistance, as it only works Monday to Friday, from 9am to 5pm.
I believe that FlixBus has failed seriously in providing a minimally decent service, not only because of the absence of the bus, but also because of the lack of alternatives or assistance to passengers, especially in such adverse weather conditions. This situation caused me great discomfort and discomfort, as well as exposing children to inappropriate conditions for a long period of time.
The photo corresponds to the bus of 17:25 arrived at 17:43",1
Horse Sh*t,Utter sh*t currently still on it even tho advertised on the website saying all passengers are able to eat and drink on the bus the as we were getting on the bus the driver took our food off of us saying we were not allowed to eat on a 3 hour bus journey from lisbon to porto from 6 until 9 so litterally all throughout dinner time me and my girlfriend havent eaten since mid day we are starving the driver was also rude throughout the journey aswell as for some reason around the start of the journey he just randomly stopped the bus on the side of the road got out no one knows why then 5 mjnutes later got back in and drove off oh and tried asking customer servuce if this was normal and if the websites just wrong or something and its been an hour now and still havent gotten a message back he also for some reason diddnt even scan our tickets at the start oh and im not even gunna meantion the 0 legroom issue as another review already has done that so a suggestion to everyonr dont try save money if you want a vhill rude with good views get the train do not and i mean this DO NOT take flixbus,1
Worst experience of my life,"I went with FlixBus from Lagos to Porto, or at least that is what I booked. At the second rest stop I was left behind. The bus driver did not do a count to see how many passengers were aboard, just drove off without me, taking all my luggage with him.
I lodged a lost luggage form and called customer service. I could see with my AirTag that my luggage had gone back down to the Algarve. I was told by customer service they couldn’t put me through to the lost and found team; I’d just have to wait for an email and that it could take up to 14 days to locate my luggage. I don’t understand why it would possibly take so long when I have the address on my AirTag. I called again, to ask for the lost and found email and the customer service officer was so rude. He said they did not have the email address for lost and found and kept talking over the top of me before hanging up. Currently stuck in a foreign country with nothing but a phone and the outfit I was wearing on the bus.",1
Lost Things process is terrible.,"Bus was smelling terrible. WC smelling. Customer service terrible if we lost something inside the bus. Since 25 June I'm waiting for an answer regarding to my bag that I left inside the bus with my ID card, Driver license, Computer.
I arrived in Figueira da Foz in the bus route number 1005 direction to Lisbon (Oriente) and reservation no. 3172336649.
I tried to call to FlixBus to let the driver know about my bag but it was impossible.
please Flixbus should have a specific number, 24 hours working for lost things.",1
"Besides the toilets will not be in condition, we just made a small stop from Lisbon to Madrid","Shame that new buses have such dirty toilets, no toilet paper, detergent for hands and besides Brazilian drivers and some Portuguese are so poorly educated. .
Never again flexibus!!
In addition",1
Extremely warm ride,The air conditioning was minimally working. It was a very long and hot ride from Porto. I felt sorry for everyone on the bus who had to endure this. I sent in complaints to Flixbus. It is supposed to be warmer tomorrow and it would be unbearable.,1
Absolute True Experience. No one deserves this! 在欧洲遭遇种族歧视,"Absolutely the WORST PART during my whole approximate 10-day stay in Portugal. Booked two buses for my trips in and out Lisbon, and met rude and indifferent drivers for both of the rides. Seems like none of the drivers at their company have the basic capability to at least say “Hi” or “Bye” to their customers, or give a basic helping hand for luggages. The first driver was on her phone speaking at a 100db voice for at least 1.5hr. The second driver just spoke one sentence to me “Don’t eat on my bus” at the very first second, whilst I was NEITHER holding any food on my hands, NOR i look like a gluttonous pig or something.

For the second ride, I paid extra money for the most front row seat in order to get some personal space. And the madame next to me just could not stop talking loudly on her phone for 3 hours straight, and rudely sticking her FAT leg (not exaggerating) into my space from the very first second. I gave her a gaze, trying not to arouse any possible disputes, and she started to spit out a string of Portuguese to me, and still refused to move an inch of her fat leg, so i have to lean myself into the aisle for the whole 3.5hr trip. Though i couldn’t understand a single word she was saying, but i could tell it was definitely something impolite, and somehow RACISM. And a bunch of passengers were playing videos or tiktoks out loud in the whole bus, so the whole space was incredibly noisy and unbearable, more like a marketplace. When i got off the bus, I never felt such a strong salvation and relief in my life.😇

My whole journey in Europe and in Portugal had been great and have met loads of nice people along the way, until I rode this HELL of a ride on Flixbus. However, i still wanna believe in that most of Portuguese people are friendly, well-behaved, and are NOT racists. Thanks to Flixbus, whom left an indelible STAIN in my memory of Portugal. Will Never Ever ride a Flixbus again in my life time, and will definitely try my best to STOP any friends or family members from booking a Flixbus. People come for vacays, which should be comfortable and stress-less, and absolute NO ONE should deserve this kind of treatment.",1
Extra seat con!,I bought a ticket and reserved a seat and an extra seat which was my right and paid for both. A few days later they changed my ticket and canceled my extra seat which I needed. I wrote to their customer care service chat stating that I have a leg condition and I need two seats and they couldn’t resolve and they said there are some priority passengers buying ticket and taking my already paid next seat! So I canceled the ticket and bought another ticket again with second seat selection. In a few hours they canceled my extra seat again without asking me! So I canceled my ticket and bought 2 tickets with different names this time because I needed that seat because of my leg condition. They didn’t cancel of course. When we took of half of the bus. Was empty and there were a lot of empty seats!!!! So they are just making things harder just for you to buy 2 tickets instead of buying extra seat! If you don’t want people to buy extra seats you just don’t give them the right to buy an extra seat not mislead them with your priority passenger lies! I guess I will never use Flixbus again!,1
Poor service,Pre-paid for seats and people in them. They would not move. Children sat by themselves at front of bus. No leg room at all. No one would move seat up.,1
Total Rip Off,"Thieves. Was taking a Flixbus from Nazare to Porto. Booked two seats a month in advance. 21 hours before the trip, got an email stating that one of my seats had been changed. Spent a half hour on Chat with customer service, who were unable to assign us two seats together. They would only refund 25% of one ticket and give a voucher for the other. Crooks. Use rail or another bus company if possible.",1
This is the last bus ride I will ever take,Terrible bus ride. We paid extra to pick our seats and they do not match the seat numbers on the bus so you actually don’t get to pick your seat. They said there was wifi but no one knows the password. They advertise a washroom on the bus but there isn’t one. The bus driver had his music blaring and that was really annoying. My husband is trying to get a refund for our seat selection but I’m not holding my breath.,1
The dirtiest and most disgusting bus I've ever seen,"I'm on the Flixbus bus going from Madrid to Lisbon, on February 9, 2024. I had already taken other trips with the same company and they were always great. But this time I couldn't believe it when I got on board. I asked the employee if it was really that vehicle.
It was very disgusting, dirt everywhere, unhealthy! bags of snacks, coffee cups spilled on the seats, on the floor, toilet paper between the seats, all the baskets on the seats were dirty and it smelled really bad. Even the curtains were filthy. I didn't imagine it would be possible to make a trip in this condition, this bus should be banned.
I thought about giving up and going to another company.",1
Disappointing experience,"We used two rooms. In the open bathroom, the water and the room became very hot and there was no music. In the room of the capsule, water was cold, the door of the room did not close and the music appeared in the middle. The music should be optional. In general, we do not recommend the experience because neither the conditions were advertised nor had the expected relaxing effect.",2
"Vigaristas, bad experience","Thieves only care about money, make false statements and do not seek a satisfactory understanding for both parties.

I bought online a fluctuation session for two with a validity of 1 year, requested the refund shortly after because there was no vacancy on the date I intended, do not make refunds even not using the services.

Floating facilities smell bad, cold water, terrible experience.",1
RELAX TURNED TO TERROR,"IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN AFTERNOON OF RELAXATION...

I found out the hard way that the water in the float tub is the same water that dozens of people pass through.
I think this should be informed to the consumer before purchasing.
The room where the bathtub is located is dark, the floor is wet and slippery.
To top off the experience, when I was in the shower, the lights turned off, leaving me in the pitch black.

I had to feel around the walls until I found the door and opened it, even though I was naked, to be able to find the robe.
There was no power outage.
No one could explain the reason for the ""blackout""
I noticed that the water in the bathtub had not been drained and the employees told me that all customers use the same water but that it was ""purified"" between one customer and another.

I bought a package for 290 euros, called a trip to the East, because of the Ayurvedic massage.

A few hours before, I was informed by SMS that there was no professional qualified to do this type of massage and that it would be replaced by another.

The exfoliation is made with a grain of raw salt, which is condemned by dermatological medicine, as it causes microlesions in the epidermis, due to the sharp edges it has.

I felt pain and asked to see what was being ""rubbed"" into my skin and it was raw salt.

Skin exfoliation is only permitted clinically with microspheres.

A Spa of this size should be aware of this.

The professionals Aisha and Simone were impeccable.

As for the company, I felt deceived in several aspects and I make this long statement so that other people can be aware of the risks of contamination when paying dearly for a float in waters that may contain sperm, menstruation, urine and feces from countless people. customers who passed by.",2
Worst,"We bought a voucher to use and tried many times to schedule it, every time we need to wait for more than one month to have availability, almost expiring. Probably it's too much popular.",1
Would have loved to have taken the tour,"They cancelled the tour, not sure
They did reach out but asked that Oncancel, which I couldnt because it was less than 24h and in terms if you cancel then you dont get full refund",1
No longer a cork store,The lady at the store was very nice but they do not sell cork items anymore so it was a waste of time to go there. She has clothing,1
N’y allez pas en groupe !,"Serveur désagréable car nous étions un grand groupe.
Aucune formule de politesse, attitude hautaine.",1
Costs much without the reward,I started planning to book this tour when seeing the Initiation Well was part of it. No longer an option but cost is the same! The guide kept saying she wanted to do what we wanted but she did not want us to stop for pictures or sights where there was no traffic on the mountain pass road that was beautiful but we had to stay at turbo speed and if I lagged by 15 seconds she was upset even though I verbalized I enjoyed going slower to appreciate the surroundings and wanted to stop at the boulders and views that ere shown other tours did stop at. At the end we had 40 extra minutes at the train station with only tourist trap area to see; No beauty that we had just sped through on the mountain and rugged beach coast. Lunch was good but longer than needed. And I appreciated the small group I was with. Good for knowing there are beautiful mountain roads on Sintra.,2
Not a tour. Just a bike ride.,"I am so sorry to have to write a negative review but I have to give honest feedback. The tour- was not a tour as others said but rather a bike ride. You will not learn much. We did not visit the beach. We blazed through a crowded Sintra. The chosen route was often very crowded with cars and pedestrians. Lunch was way too long- which was because of the other guests who wanted to eat a lot but it is up to the guide to keep us on schedule. Maya drank a lot at lunch (2 bottles) and sorry that is not acceptable from a tour guide. Her objective was to keep us safe but her tone got increasingly angry and hostile. In the end, no one tipped which was painful for us. Maya is sweet but this tour needs to be improved.",2
Dangerous ride! Would not Recommend!,"I'd like to recount my dangerous experience on April 22, 2024:

1) The tour description proved highly misleading and inaccurate.

1.1 -- Despite claiming suitability for all age groups from 14 to 99 in the bike tour description (Picture 1), the reality was quite different. The trip encompassed numerous challenging climbs and covered a considerable distance of about 60 km (45 miles). While I managed to complete the journey, it's improbable that most individuals in their 50s, 60s, or 70s could undertake such a demanding ride in a single day, not to mention those in their 80s or 90s.
1.2 -- The trip was advertised as an 8-hour excursion, with a start time of 9:30 am, suggesting a return around 5:30 pm. However, we didn't return until approximately 6:30 pm

2) The safety of this trip is highly questionable.
In our group of seven, including the guide, three individuals, including myself and the guide, experienced falls (that is 3/7 chance of fall). The guide, Maya, fell and injured herself while attempting to avoid a car on a narrow road, highlighting the inherent dangers of the journey. The route included traversing very narrow, bumpy, and heavily trafficked streets, hardly the serene countryside tour promised in the tour description.

3) Lack of consideration for slower participants was evident throughout the trip.
Despite encountering issues with two members with their e-bike and falling behind, the guides did not stay with us. Instead, they rode ahead, leaving us to navigate the route alone until another participant, Ben, kindly offered his assistance for the remainder of the journey.

4) Poor time management compromises safety.
Excessive time spent at lunch, including the consumption of three bottles of wine by the guide and other participants, contributed to delays. Furthermore, mishandling of meeting times resulted in additional complications, including missed trains and hurried efforts to get back. This ultimately caused an accident as I navigated a sharp turn on a bustling street. Thank God, I did not break my arm or leg!

I would advise strongly against booking this tour.",1
Did not live up to description of tour,"This bike tour did NOT live up to the description for the tour. We did NOT ""visit some wonderful beaches"" nor see ""fantastic castles and palaces"". Was terrible negotiating on the busy roads to avoid the buses and cars. Plus you had to ride and avoid tons of pedestrians to get to the train station. Also not impressed by the consumption of 3 bottles of wine at lunch by Maia and 3 other people. Would not recommend this tour. Totally disappointing.",1
Disappointing Tour! Would not Recommend,"Did not follow the itinerary that was on the website! We expected to stop at 1-2 beaches as stated on the website. Very few stops to take pictures. Did not visit the palace. The tour guide was way in front of the group. The description of the tour did not come close to our experience, We were on very busy roads, around a lot people and cars and did not feel safe. Would mot recommend!",1
Dangerous ride,Bike ride is for very experienced riders. I do spin every day but this ride was something very different. It was ok physically but you need to be very agile to handle the mountain bike part of it. A lot of the ride You are riding on VERY BUSY streets with lots of cars and buses and lots of sharp turns. The guides did not stay with us and rode up far ahead of the group. Not recommended unless you are a very experienced bike rider who also doe’s mountain biking.,1
Abgesagt,Tour wurde vom Veranstalter abgesagt - habe ich TripAdvisor schon 10 Mal mitgeteilt - aber ich werde immer wieder aufgefordert eine Bewertung abzugeben - daher nun eine Ungenügend für Trip Advisor! Alles klar?,1
Kike palabras desafortunadas...,Hicimos el free tour con Kike de chile! Lo que nos contó fue interesante pero al inicio casi del tour empezó a perseguirnos un señor con malas pintas y estaba el grupo nervioso....Kike nos dijo que o estábamos atentos al tour o lo paraba...me pareció totalmente fuera de lugar ese comentario...claro que estamos para escuchar el tour pero si alguien nos persigue y encima con una mala pinta que no veas lo normal es que estemos atentos por si nos robaba. en otra parada nos dio dos minutos para ver una iglesia y a la vuelta faltaba una chica a lo que él respondió que le importaba un huevo ( literalmente) creo que o ese día tenía un mal día o es un antipático.,2
Choose Another Company - No Show,"I visited Lisbon with my family and we were excited to learn about the city. We arrived at the meeting point early to meet our guide, however he never showed up! We waited an extra 30 mins after the meeting time in the square, but he never came.

I wrote to the guide but he never responded on the Guru messaging platform.

There were many other Tour guides in the square from other companies, would recommend others choosing a different company instead",1
GuruWalk - The Secrets of Lisbon,"We had booked the 7:00 p.m. tour with Julia in German. At lunchtime we received a call asking if we would also take part in the 5:00 p.m. tour in English, as the 7:00 p.m. tour could not take place. We confirmed this and also received the new dates via WhatsApp. At 5:00 p.m. there was no one at the agreed meeting point. After we had waited another 10 minutes and tried to call the guide (without success) and wrote to him, the excuse was that he had had a bicycle accident and could not come. We later received an email saying that there were not enough bookings. We are more than disappointed and can only advise against using this provider.",1
Utterly Disappointing,"First of all, the establishment was difficult to find as signage was obscured by trees and cars parked in front. Host seemed distracted and indifferent as if this tasting was an obligation. We pointed out that the other couple who appeared to be looking for the place may have been lost; he said ""they'll figure it out"" and then told them they'd have to catch up because they were late. Host took ""breaks"" between tastings and left, no interactions other than brief explanations about the products. The tasting was supposed to be an hour; we finished in 30 minutes. Stale corn nuts and some olives as snacks. All in all, this was a process, not the enjoyable learning experience we had hoped it would be.",2
Absolutely terrible experience,"Our “host” (if you can even call him that) was incredibly rude from the start. I tried being polite multiple times, but he was just mean and dismissive in return. It completely ruined the atmosphere. The port wine might have been fine, but it’s hard to enjoy anything when the person hosting makes you feel unwelcome. Would not recommend this place to anyone — there are plenty of better and friendlier tastings elsewhere.",1
Not very nice..,"It was not a nice experience. Our host Riccardo was very unwelcome and arrogant… It could be a very nice experience, but sadly it was a bommer. Maybe with a different host it could be very nice, the wine was good.",2
Not worth it,"not worth it at all. 3 cups of wine which equal to 10 euros
weird experience to say the least
it wasn’t enjoyable and there’s probably way better options than this",1
Forgettable,"The experience was pretty forgettable, mostly because of the host Ricardo. It was not a very engaging or energetic conversation. The host’s tone was borderline condescending, the environment was not inviting enough to feel comfortable to ask questions — even asking to take a picture of the bottle of wines felt like a big ask.",2
Disappointed,Extremely loud and crowded. Average wines. Not for the connoisseur. Great for stag and stagette parties and people who like to party.,1
Disappointing experience!!,Not sure why you’re requesting I review this as you cancelled on me 2 hours before scheduled time! Very disappointing to say the least.,1
Possible scam,The activity was cancelled on the day it was supposed to happen. I did not get a reimbursement. There was no explanation given. Terrible experience,1
There are better options,"We cancelled when no one showed up to do the tour. There were over 20 people standing in the rain outside the locked building. We called to be told he was running late and would be 10-15 mins. Still didn’t arrive and we called again - further delay. We cancelled as didn’t think the event would be up to much if one guy was going to try to serve over 20 people meats, cheeses, wines. The only positive was we did receive the refund and found a wonderful wine bar - Wine Lover, Bairro Alto where the owner provided a private tasting.",1
Running Late - From The Vine,"Was asked to arrive 15 minutes early so we ran from one reservation to the next, in the pouring rain, to only have our host not show. Thankfully TripAdvisor refunded our money, but it definitely was a waste of time. On a side note, we ended up at El Clan and felt like it was a blessing in disguise!!",1
Ripping you off as mugs,This business is unreliable. Stood for 30 minutes in the rain and the place was closed . No show. They are a rip-off run by amateurs - avoid at all costs. If you have booked - cancel. I am going to the place tomorrow to try to get a refund 🤞,1
Late cancellation,"Didn’t happen! Cancellation was emailed to me 1 hour before experience should have taken place, by this time we were already at the destination. Although we were told that there was an extenuating circumstance, I still feel an hours notice was unacceptable as we were on a tight schedule.",1
Disappointing,"One our before the wine tasting we got an Whatsapp message that the experience is cancelled. It was a gift to my friend and we planned the day around that experience on the evening. If we had been informed earlier, we would.have planned the day different. All together ist was very disappointing and we.missed half a day of exploring the city of Lisbon.",1
Under delivered,"So, Andre was a lovely host and there’s no doubting the passion and vision here, but our wine tasting was actually only half an hour long and we had very small servings of three Portuguese wines, so I really sorry but I can’t see that this is anything like good value, I’m afraid.",2
Very Disappointing experience,"I always like to do a wine tasting when I visit a new place, and found this the worst value for money wine tasting experience I have done.
We did the Aperitif wine tasting at €27 per person and stated lasts one hour 6:30-7:30.
By 6:50 the experience was finished.
3 tiny amounts of wine to try with minimal information explained about the wines. Almost as if it was just read off the back of the bottle.
Maybe the lunchtime one is better, but me and my partner felt fully ripped off having spent €54 to have about 150ml of wine each in total and be in and out in 20 minutes (and that’s no exaggeration)! A poor experience and no value for money.",1
Wouldn't recommend,"The snacks that were included were a tiny bowl of peanuts & olives and when I told him I was allergic all he did was separate the two and didn't offer anything else. My pre-dinner wine tasting was actually combined with the wine tasting lunch since it was cancelled that day. There were two parties there for the lunch and 2 parties (one other including my party) there for the pre-dinner wine tasting. The 'lunch"" looked nothing like the photo they provided on tripadvisor. And, the other party doing the pre-dinner wine tasting asked to be served the ""lunch"" that the other two parties were being served and he didn't offer the same to my party, and he didn't charge them for it, which is quite unfair to the 2 parties that paid way more for the ""lunch"". The tasting took about 30 minutes and we were served 3 glasses (small tasting size) but he said we could stay for a bit so we did. I asked him a few questions when he was on his phone (during down time) and although he answered my questions he was a bit reluctant to go into detail and made it seem like the questions I was asking had very obvious answers. He also asked the other two parties more wine (after they completed their entire tasting) and did not offer my party. Overall, it seems that he treated my party quite poorly. Not sure if it's because we were significantly younger than the rest of the parties but nonetheless we were definitely not treated with as much respect as them. Would not recommend.",2
Wasn’t even open,It was cancelled with no warning. Showed up and waited while the place looked completely closed. I called their phone number multiple times and no one answered. There were about 4 other people who showed up and none of us could understand why it was closed even though we all had a supposed reservation . Even a day later I’ve received no contact or an explanation as to why they didn’t open.,1
Never again,I paid in advance and tasting was cancelled less than an hour before the start. I was told repeatedly I have to cancel within 24 hrs but the business can cancel 45 minutes before the tasting? Very unprofessional-beware!,1
Bad.,"Highly discouraged because the stop in Belem turned out to be shorter than the directions given , so remained on the ground with many passengers without being able to continue the excursion",1
Average at best,"The boat was ok, basic seating and picnic tables. The lack of bathroom facilities was very disappointing and not being told prior to boarding made for an uncomfortable ride for one our party.",2
Boring,"A very grey day didn't help but the tour along the coast of abandoned, graffiti covered industry was not enjoyable. There was no wine at the bar on the boat & no food available to buy apart from crisps & a few chocolate bars.",2
Theft,"I waited at the meeting point no one showed up, I tried to call the contact no one answered. I asked for a refund, they just said it wasn't possible",1
disappointment,"Ship not nice, partially broken - red/white tape cordoned off. No information about where you are sailing past. Disappointment, would not recommend.",2
Disappointed,"Unfortunately, what a disappointment this boat trip was, even though we were promised in advance that there was sufficient shade on the boat, this turned out not to be the case. The sunshade is broken. I am forced to sit indoors with my children, where the air conditioning does not work. They really did try to turn on the air conditioning at the start of the trip, but just feeling the loudspeaker to see if the air conditioning is working doesn't give you much confidence. Screens show where we are sailing past, but these are unreadable due to the sun. There is free WiFi, which is nice, but compensates for the ridiculous price for a bottle of water. I don't often write a review, but I am really disappointed in this trip. If they had just been honest that the sunshade was broken, we would have had a choice not to come along. Now we have nowhere to go.",2
Trip from hell,"Horrific trip. No ventilation on boat and had to ask for roof to be open to let in fresh air otherwise we would have been roasted alive. The staff member rather reluctantly did what I requested, but shut roof for last thirty minutes of trip. My daughter and myself felt extremely unwell and I actually vomitted when I came off boat, due to the heat. Staff quite rude and no guide",1
Not worth the money at all!,"Tour lasted an hour and a half. Would of been good to know what we were going past as new to the city we had no idea what we were looking at which is why I booked a tour. By the end of it we were very bored. Not worth the money really.
The free drink was nuts were nice but considering we booked a tour there was no tour section we just sat there. I understand it’s a silent tour but either have something to say what you are going past or do come try through headphone or something. The tour (knowing) bit is lacking. It said written in English I didn’t see anything written anywhere!",2
First time at the José Saramago Foundation,"Not very interesting, although we were welcomed by very friendly people.
What a shame it's not more interactive or unsettling.",2
Horrible experience,Worst experience. I contacted them for three days. They never picked up the phone or respond to my trip advisor messages or WhatsApp. I waited for a hour and no one showed up.,1
Beach lounge,"We were assured that we were getting VIP treatment in a beach lounge with a welcome drink, and beach loungers to relax on. We were sent pictures of what the beach lounge would look like; this is NOT what was received.

We arrived and the beach club had not received any money from the company for our reservation, only a phone call to reserve a table for a large group of 25.

I called and asked Jorge to meet me at the venue, and instead he quickly paid the tab at the bar (lots of us hadn’t ordered a drink yet!) and then drove off. We didn’t meet anyone from the company, and we’re so shocked that’s how we were treated we rang again to reassure us that all of our drinks would be paid for. Once we ordered them and sent them a receipt, they then refused to pay.

We asked where the 35€ per person was spent, other than on an 3-8€ welcome drink….and they said that the rest was used on securing the reservation in the beach lounge. The beach club had never received any money from them, and therefore 700€ was taken from us with nothing to show for it.

The tickets had been booked from early January 2024 and with just 1 week before our trip they couldn’t even confirm the name of the beach lounge and we’re unaware of our reservation, times and deposit paid.

We would never book with this company again, and we recommend all other hen and stag do’s stay well clear.",1
This company is a scam,"THIS IS A SCAM
We booked a beach party which included beach lounge and free drink, with loungers, VIP etc
We gave him 875€ and he snuck in and paid €175 for 27 drinks (which included water) and ran off. The restaurant hadn’t received any money from him, just a call to say 25 people would be coming…
NO LOUNGE
NO FREE DRINKS
NO LOUNGERS
NO VIP",1
Bad experience. It just didn't happen,"I am very indignant. I paid and the experience didn't happen. I simply waited 30 minutes at the meeting point and no one showed up. Even though you kept a record of my phone number, I didn't even receive a message. Nothing reliable. I feel sorry for Tripadvisor to record an experience like this. Because for me it was a reliable application. Disgusting, the delight and disrespect towards the consumer.",1
Scamming Incompetent thieves,"This is the WORST company and EXPERIENCE I’ve ever had!
We paid for an “Airport Strip luxury limousine transfer”
This is certainly NOT what we got
Here is a summary of the key issues (keeping the duplicate and minor problems off this to save an essay)

21st April. Our query answered and agreed. Very forceful to take a deposit same day and made it very difficult for us to pay with anything other than a card/ bank transfer that would protect us from fraud etc. This was paid reluctantly by basic card transaction in the end on the same day.
We discussed the option of beach party service but was advised to sort it afterwards (the next day) and was promise a call back

24th April no word from these guys so we chased up for confirmation of the service ordered (limo airport transfer 3 strippers)
And the beach/pool party options. Advised ‘booked and sorted’! Nothing more no detail!

27 April: verbal call - nothing sorted
I sent a summary of discussion as they obviously don’t write anything down

3rd May still no response despite call requests and promises id receive 1
drafted in my colleague to support with their incompetence

4th May evening got a call, only to have to go over all the requirements again inc resending my email address for the confirmation id been waiting for since day 1 (21/04)
I resent all the requirements again in writing
These guys make you feel like they are doing you a favour even though we paid for it.
Abandoned ship on the Pool party stuff as they couldn’t even get the requirements of the strip transfer right

11th May
They contact us for hotel info
They then proceed to say they don’t have the limo or the girls to do the transfer and it will now be at our hotel!?!
We said we were specific about it being 3 girls and in a limo and during the transfer
We were told they will try to get what was agreed and paid for and will confirm back

23rd May - no response so we chased again
1 liner response from them as “all sorted”
I sent another summary - which they confirmed

5th / 6th June
They ask for the remainder of the deposit
We reconfirm (now told a bus)
We are forced to agree and pay as no time to sort anything new

9th June transfer day
It’s a mini bus ( not a limo as per their website
No girls
No champagne on arrival (as per their website)

The entire transfer to our hotel no girls
We contact them the entire way to be told any minute and it’s a surprise
We get to the top of the road near our hotel and park outside a restaurant where families and children are dining
The bus blocks half the road causing traffic
The girls turn up 15 mins later
They do a show for 10 mins in front of the restaurant and then leave
We then had to walk the rest of the way to our hotel with our luggage",1
Beware - scam!,"We booked airport transfer from Faro to Albufeira and it was agreed in advance we were getting a party bus/limo in advance for 10 people. With 3 girls for strip show for the duration of the journey from airport. We paid 900€ for this (£800)
Conveniently they only accepted payment into their bank account as their machine didn’t recognise my credit card (should have been the first flag to us)
Anyway we didn’t get any strip show for the entire duration, we got a mini bus (100€ mini bus transfer) and no show for the entire journey.
The mini bus then pulled up outside of the hotel next to a restaurant where we waiting a fora further 10 mins for 3 back alley girls to get on the bus for 7 mins of dance.
Very expensive and not what we asked for.
David and Jorge are both scam artists so just be aware and don’t fall for it like we did!",1

Dangerous and inappropriate place for children: Fun track alcantara,"A dangerous and inappropriate place for children. My son of 9 years after we acquired the trampoline service was sitting on the floor and was attacked having been bitten in the head by the chao of the owner or staff member who did not intervene, nor apologized having transferred the responsibility to my son saying ""your son is who excited the dog "". The dog was loose in the trampoline area and treated himself like a 5-month-old boxer. This place does not meet minimum safety conditions for children.",1
A place avoid,"Careful, the owner is physically violent and rude. I have seen disturbing situations in this establishment.",1
2 person,i will stay there 2 days with my cousin i very exited if i go there my cousin come from Germany i wish you please give me information how much price in your hotel room,2
Bilhetes inexistentes,"Incrível... tenho estado super atenta para comprar bilhete, às 10he30 ainda não havia nada... ausentei me 2h qdo volto já está esgotado. Acredito q qdo abriu já estava esgotado 😡",1
Disappointing experience in the Top Secret room,"I did the Top Secret room with a group of friends and, unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. I've done more than 30 escape rooms and this was one of the worst experiences to date. The space is very small, the puzzles are almost all based on locks, without any kind of technological innovation or engaging narrative. To make it worse, the last challenge was not working and the game master entered the room saying that ""we had already made it"", with no sense of completion or satisfaction. We literally felt pushed out. For the price and reputation of Game Over, I expected far more.",2
Unfortunate experience,"We came for the fourth, and probably the last time, to make an escape room to “Game Over,” the “Haunted Mansion,” and unfortunately we were the only team to have no tolerance. We finished the game at 16:30 without fear and were the only team in the waiting room, and there were several games going on at the same time.",1
Bad care with customers,"The game is funny but the customer management is terrible. Each game master informs the promotions that he remembers and when talked to the responsible, the situation is not assumed remitting the blame to the customer who did not read the site. The specific situation is that the birthday player is entitled to an entrance if the game is between 7 days before or after the birthday. When we made the reservation, at the end of the last game, no one informed us of this promotion. When we asked for the same today, following the birthday of one of the participants, they refused to make the anniversary discount, because it was not asked when the match was marked. We had no way to do so, since we had not been informed. And then began an endless number of excuses but the fault was always the client and never the game master. Lamentável",2
Boring,Totally boring from start to finish. A complete waste of time and money. I will never go to another escape room as long as I live.,1
Disappointing,"Not funny questions, hard to solve in group, not enough time to solve till the end. The help was in time, but takes all the fun",2
Disappointed with the gamemaster,"The game master was a little antipathetic. We arrived late because of the transit of the Christmas lights, they told us that they would discount 10 minutes of game, which we accepted without problems! However, when the gamemaster told us that the game was going to end there were 15 minutes left to play and not 10... the gamemaster constantly intervened and the only time we clicked the button did not answer us. He did not introduce us to the game and spoke to us as if he was bothered by our presence, even though we had arrived late (which we could not avoid at all), we were paying for a positive experience and not to be treated this way.
We have already made several escape rooms here and were all fantastic, this, unfortunately, was the opposite...",1
Total failure,Of many Escape Rooms I visited this was undoubtedly the worst of all. From lack of organization to lack of professionalism of employees. We made booking and when we arrived there was no Reservation. We have no solution. Not to repeat!!!,1
Game master inexpérimentée,Accueil sympa mais game master d’aucune aide car ses instructions n’étaient que le doublons des indices déjà trouvés donc on n’avance pas. Dommage c’est une vrai déception pourtant sommes des grand fans des escapes games. Tout le monde peut débuter mais avoir un game master senior aurait sûrement aidé.,2
"The Game Master was not good, which ruins the experience","Today I went with a group of friends to Sala Oriente Express. The room itself was top notch, we liked the riddles and it's well done apart from the time factor, because it's clearly not a room that can only be done in 1 hour, personally 1h15min I think would be enough given the amount of clues in each room to find and what there is to do inside.
From my point of view, the experience comes largely from the Game Master that we have, and this time it wasn't the best. The one who came to us was Malu, and since it was the 4th time we went to Game Over, we think she didn't get into the character as much as the other Game Masters who came to us (Sena, Sergio and the others that I don't remember ). It was really bad. We get help every 10 minutes, and every help we ask for only makes us more confused! She was never clear in what she said, causing us to waste a lot of time. Mainly in the Dtr room. But anyway, I don't want to say too much so as not to give spoilers... I think that out of 4/5 of the help we asked for, adding them all up, she responded to 1.
Since we know that there are rooms that it is not possible to finish in 1h, we always schedule it for 11:30am because there is nothing afterwards, and normally if there is not much left they let us finish, and this time it was different, we asked her to let us finish. , and she said no because it was lunch time and at the limit we would be there but 10/15 me, which is not IMMENSE.
It was a bad experience with this Game Master.
Another subject, I think the discount was what attracted me to booking the next one. I know it still exists but it doesn't make sense for the following reasons:

1° During the week 90% of the population is employed, as they work and go to school.
2° Schedule for the same day? What if there is no vacancy?

As a customer, I think it's not smart of Game Over!",2
It didn't live up to my expectations of Game Over,We were taken out of 4 minutes of Escape Room time by Game Master Tatiana for going to the bathroom before entering the room (and this was not told to us in advance). For an experience that is expensive (100€ per hour) there should be more respect for the customer.,2
So much worse than other alternatives,"So we have done 40 plus escape rooms and Jack the Ripper and Top Secret were both within the lower five we have completed.

Top Secret had an issue where the puzzle to open the door into the final room was broken ruining the experience and cutting off the best element of the game. No discount offered considering the experience.

Thought we’d give it the benefit of the doubt and come back 18 months later… This was equally disappointing in a different way…

Jack the Ripper was just completely unintuitive, no logic at all to the clues. Whilst the puzzle count was fairly low, the clues were completely random, basically impossible without clues which ruins the game. There is items in the room you don’t even use.

In honesty, sad to say but just avoid this place if you’re looking for a good escape experience, independents are generally much better, very disappointed.",1
"Barely passable as an escape room, even for the most inexperienced","For anyone who has ever done more than a couple of escape rooms, they will quickly realise how poorly thought out and unintuitive the Jack the Ripper room is. After struggling with the randomness of this escape and asking the staff if anyone had ever done it unaided, they said no, not even close. How is that considered a well designed room that literally no one can do it without help. It was bland, boring and had no atmosphere or imagination. I strongly recommend people avoid these franchise branches of escape rooms, try the independent ones, the difference is insane.",1
Avoid the Forbidden Temple like the plague.,"My partner and I have done >100 escape rooms and we brought my dad to do his first room. We did Forbidden Temple of Montezuma and were incredibly disappointed. The first puzzle involves finding puzzle pieces hidden in a dark room. It took us 10 minutes to find the last piece to the first puzzle. ER puzzles should test your brain, not how well you see in the dark - a major pet peeve of mine so we were off to a bad start. We usually only need a few gentle hints in a typical room but this time we needed a lot of hints, even with hints we still struggled. The GM admitted that just about every team needs a hint for one puzzle - to me that means there is a problem with the puzzle! Overall the puzzle count was fairly low and didn't leave you with a feeling of success. On the whole the puzzles were incredibly obtuse. I wish we hadn't booked this room.
Overall the room was well maintained and the tech worked without any obvious issues. The GM was perfectly average but the puzzle flow was simply terrible. Judging from the screams we heard in the adjacent horror rooms, it seemed like people were having a good time so I wouldn't completely rule out Game Over Lisbon, but avoid the Forbidden Temple like the plague. The puzzles and game structure were simply terrible.",1
Bad service by the manager,"We played Top Agents and the room was kinda small but had a cool vibe, filled with some really awesome puzzles. Our host Miguel was top-notch; if it was up to me, I'd give him a full 5 stars.

So why the one-star review? Here's the deal: we hit a glitch that fast-tracked us to the final stage. We still had around 12 minutes to go, and honestly, not finishing wouldn't have been a biggie. But this bug was a real fun-killer. We asked if we could maybe switch rooms, and the manager offered us a 20% discount. But get this: that's their regular deal for anyone hopping into a second room the same day. Not cool, right? So we pushed for some of our money back since the glitch messed up a lot of the puzzles for us. Instead of dealing with us directly, the manager had Miguel say it wasn't possible—which we know isn't true. The guy didn't even have the guts to talk to us himself; he sent Miguel to do his dirty work.

5 stars for Miguel, our awesome host
3 stars for the room, pretty solid
1 star for the manager, not cool man",1
"Glitch in our room, wasn't possible to get another room or at least some money in return by manager","We played Top Agents and the room was kinda small but cool, with some really great puzzles. Our host Miguel was awesome; we loved the guy. If I could rate just him, he'd get a full 5 stars from me.

So why only two stars overall? Well, we hit a bug that sent us straight to the final stage. We still had like 12 minutes left and wouldn't have minded if we didn't finish everything. But this glitch kinda killed the vibe. We asked if we could switch rooms, the manager refused and instead offered us a 20% discount on another room (so we had to pay twice). Turns out, that's just their standard deal for anyone doing a second room the same day. We weren't happy with that, and asked if we could get jut 20% of our money back, because the bug ruined a bunch of puzzles for us. Carlos had Miguel tell us it wasn't possible—which isn't true, by the way. Carlos didn't even come out to talk to us himself, he just had Miguel do all the talking, even though we could see him.

5 stars for Miguel, our host
4 stars for the room itself
1 star for the professionalism of the manager.",1
Disappointing,"Only played one game because playing more would be a waste of money. Uncreative and logically unconnected puzzles. Some puzzles were impossible to make sense of without the help of the game master. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if it is your first experience with escape rooms, it will ruin your impression of this awesome activity.",2
Zero effort to compensate customer,"I went with my team to play 2 games at this company. We arrived 20 minutes early and still confusion ensued. It started with forms that were registered by everyone but the second employee who appeared started shouting saying that we hadn't filled them all out yet, shouting each person's name into the space. If I didn't want to be identified, at this point all of this company's customers knew my name.
Even worse was that we chose a room and “due to a technical problem” it was not possible to do so. They informed us that we could choose another room (a lie as in reality we only had 2 more to choose from as the others were reserved) but they stated that in the end they would give us compensation. For suspension, at the end when they gave us the “compensation”, it was a 10% discount code like the ones they give to all customers who finish a game. Disgraceful customer support and management.
The game was ok, even though the staff said it was the most difficult, we didn't think so, we thought it was quite simple and straightforward.",2
not a good escape room,"not creative at all. On top of it, it's almost impossible to perceive the logic of the game by yourself, only with the staff help",1
Abaixo das expetativas,"Não era minimamente assustador. Apenas um jogo de enigmas e jogos. Era possível retirar as algemas sem recorrer a qualquer chave, tinha um botão para soltar, eh, eh..... Era possível sair da sala sempre que se quisesse e entrar noutras salas.... Enfim, dinheiro mal gasto...",1
Disappointed,Magnificent store with lots of choices unfortunately the person who served us was pedantic made no effort to speak slowly in English. No smile. I think he was bored of selling us only three bottles. After reflection we should have left without buying.,2
Rude service... there are better options nearby,"Rude service. Been here twice and neither visit was ideal. The first time the member of staff who served me could hardly be bothered to check whether they had the wine I wanted and on the second visit I was rudely told off for picking a bottle of wine to buy from the shelf, without asking them to take it off the shelf for me… needless to say they didn’t apologise, just wanted to argue that they weren’t rude… end result, no sale. There are many other places in the area to buy wine, several are both more helpful, knowledgable of their stock and polite.",1
Fast delivery... but terrible service,"Good thing first: the delivery of Garrafeira Nacional has always been impressively fast for me (I ordered five+ times from them). And the choice of wines is pretty good.

However, the trouble started when I received a bottle with a wine fault. I contacted customer service to ask what the policy was. I was told I needed to take a picture, which I did and sent. They then claimed to not have received the picture, so I had to send it again. They then said, I needed to return the bottle and that a pickup was arranged on Monday. However, nobody turned up (nor was anything arranged). Apparently, nothing was arranged, because I should send back *all* the bottles in the delivery (12 bottles), not just the faulty one. If I didn't send them all back... then any fault in the others was my problem (which I find both highly unethical and dubious legally!).
After replying that this was nonsense, they agreed to a pickup of the one bottle and scheduled that... and if I pass the test of their enologist (!?), then I may have my money returned for the wine (let's see if they actually will refund!)

I'm quite flabbergasted by their unhelpful service. It seems they are blocking every step of the way to avoid a refund for a faulty product. This shouldn't be such an issue - and other retailers have significantly better service in my experience. So, despite their fast delivery, I'll look elsewhere in future.",2
Bad service,"What's going on with this store? I've been shopping for many years in the National bottle and always indicated to friends and family, but the service is deteriorating every day, in the last visit was the drop of water to rate it as bad! They do not know the products, the first answer is always ""we do not have"" to then insistently our verify that they have, a real failure , absolutely do not want to sell anything and the shop empty.",1
The service has changed a lot and for the WORSE!!,"I've bought wines several times at Garrafeira, but today I received very poor service from 3 women. It started with one of them interrupting one of the salespeople, saying that the price of those wines were much more expensive than what was on the website. From then on it was just bad will! Terrible!!",1
Terrible attendance. It's changed a lot!,"This was the tenth time I bought from Garrafeira Nacional and I received very poor service from 3 women. From the beginning they said that the 2 wines I saw on the website (which they had in the store) could not be sold and if I wanted them they would be much more expensive. With much reluctance, I continued to eat the seven bottles",1
Zero rating service.,"Today I tried to buy a liquor in this store, but it was impossible, not because it was full, on the contrary it was empty with lots of employees chatting. But the employees didn't pay much attention, even before leaving I said there was a bit of a rush, but I was still ignored by the employees.
I am a customer of this store and I make purchases for my restaurants, I was disappointed.",1
"Big choice, little courtesy","Great choice of wines, somewhat questionable customer service. I often travel for work and in the evening when I'm tired I speak English regardless of where I am, although I speak and understand many other languages, including Portuguese. After having approached in English, I was laughed at in Portuguese by the 2 clerks (Time Out Market point of sale) because I didn't remember the credit card pin. Not only are they rude, they are also not very smart.
I no longer want to drink the port I purchased.",2
"Watch out for the exchange rate ""trick"" - always choose Euros!","Great service while in the Baxia store BUT when i checked my receipt they had charged my in USD instead of Euros - a classic ""trick"" used to rip off the tourist who isn't on guard. A 4% mark up and loust exchange rate. I will not be back.",2
"Poor booking, unreliable","After multiple confirmation emails (probably automated), and us reaching out to contact 30 min prior to pick up, no response. They had no booking for us, no driver arranged. They scrambled at the last minute to find another, we started 1 hour late, negatively impacting later plans. Do not book. Plenty of tuk tuks waiting at square.",2
Find A Better Tour,"We were referred to this tour provider and were extremely disappointed. The guide was knowledgeable but we couldn’t hear him at all while the tuktuk, which was too small for us, was in motion. We could only hear him when the vehicle was stopped.

Then, the tuktuk broke down in Alfama. I tried to end the tour then, but he begged us to stay on. We agreed to continue on to Belém. We waited over 30 minutes for a new tuktuk to arrive. And then the guide tried to get us to stop somewhere else on the way, when I was clear we only wanted Belém. Then at Belém he tried to get us to continue the tour. It was so bad.

Our five hour tour was now three hours. I understand the company was counting on that revenue, so they wouldn’t let us pay less than the $250. But to not even give us a discount for the 30 minutes we were waiting around is outrageous. So $250 for technically 2.5 hours on a tour we couldn’t hear anything on. This company and their tours are complete scams. Stay away.",1
No response and gesture,"We excitedly booked a guided tour through this platform, but unfortunately our experience turned out to be an absolute disaster. The guide who was supposed to accompany us never showed up, leaving us perplexed and frustrated.

After waiting patiently for two hours, our wait was rewarded with nothing but disappointment. We were really looking forward to seeing the local attractions and learning about the history of the area, but it all remained an unfulfilled dream due to the guide's absence.",1
Bad attention,"Employed bad education, threatened me, increased his tone of voice by pronouncing threatening words. Bad service. There are better places in Lisbon to drink with better service.",1
They beat me with a dick,"Site well located but poor in kindness, poor education and level. I was treated extremely badly , they surrounded me with drinks , and they went to get a dick to beat me for asking questions .
And they sent me the receipt that I paid for the trash after they surrounded my drink . They were two girls. I do not recommend at all",1
Poor education and low level,"Very bad service. People are extremely poorly educated and the ginja is not worth a cent . Worst place in Lisbon. I was badly treated , and I was almost kicked out of there for asking questions about the bottles .",1
Avoid terrible,"Terrible experience. The Registration took a long while and after 15 minutes answering a lot of questions, none of us could get it to work on an apple or android phone and there was no customer service and so we closed the account immediately and they never refunded the money which we deposited. Also, they never responded to our email asking for refund as it stated on the app before we closed the account.
Trust pilot reviews confirms this also.... so it's not a once off. My advice is to avoid unless you want to give away or lose your money.",1
Ma che pena,Uno schifo l'app gira non funziona non sono riuscita a registrarmi . Tutto in portoghese un vero disastro,1
THEY NEVER PICK ME UP AT MEETING POINT,"You don't have to pay to join this trip because they let stranger with out confirmation to join their tour. This company is not professional. you just wait to the meeting point they set and they would never come. you will not be picked up at the meeting point, no refund solution is offered. just be careful

They said a professional tour company but none could give solution

"Worst thing I've ever lived, I'll make a claim since I have photos that backed up my complaint","Our tour was Fatima, Batalha, Nazaré and Obidos and I have never had a more nefarious tour, the driver guide Paolo of the worst that I found in this magnificent profession, we were 8 people and 5 of them only went to accompany a private tour of the other 3 people. Driver with aggressive driving and high speeds, coming to address one of the people (travel agent) with very bad forms, when he made a simple comment. In Obidos we arrived at 17.37 and at 18 in the car, we could not even get close to the castle, the time that left us was just to go to half main street and back. Tour to forget,",1
Read up about this place and then decide if you want to visit or spend your time exploring somewhere that suits you,"Would prefer to have visited another part of Portugal - we drove from Lisbon to Fatima with a tour guide. Took almost an hour and a half to get there - we were there for just over an hour learning about the reason for the new church that was built and the other buildings. Lit a candle, walked around the huge area and then drove to our next destination. Given we wanted to see as much as we could in our limited time in Portugal - this was not a great use of our time but was on the tour we chose. Unless you have a deep religious connection to visiting Fatima - I would use my time better visiting other places or spending more time eg at Obidos.",2
Cancelled trip at night,The tour was cancelled with a message at night and in the morning just saw it when i start to prepare for day tour. Thank you Go2Lisbon for nothing..,1
Complete waste of money.,"What a SCAM and waste of money! Our tour guide, Ruben, picked us up at a hotel just a few blocks away from where we were staying. The description was correct that it was a ""small group""---the four in my group and 2 other women. Cannot fault our tour guide for the fact that it was a cloudy, foggy, drizzly morning, but the rest is on him: We drove up to the center of Sintra (I assume) and were told we would explore on our own. He took off, so there was no one to ask for suggestions/recommendations, etc.

We walked back to the car and were driven up to the Pena Palace and he let us out (in the drizzle) while he parked. We then followed him to a long line of tourists waiting for one of 2 small tour buses making the property loop to take us up to the Palace. He then told us that there were ""too many people"" there that day and there were no more slots for people to actually go into the Palace. THAT'S WHAT WE PRE-PAID FOR! He walked us through a little open area outside, but we couldn't even take any photos of ""views"" because of the fog. We were allowed to quickly walk into a small chapel, and out again, then back on the little bus down to the parking area. That was it. That's all we saw of Pena Palace! That was the reason why we booked this tour!

He then drove us to the Cabo da Roca, a monument marking the westernmost point on continental Europe. He pointed to the monument and never told us how much time we'd be able to stay there. While we walked over and took the obligatory photo in front of the marker, we couldn't see anything of the view because of the fog. My husband and sons went for a walk on the boardwalk area in hopes of catching a glimpse of the ocean further out, while I waited for them at the monument. 5 minutes later Ruben contacts me on What's App, obviously agitated that we weren't back yet! I texted my husband and they all hurried back to the parking lot.

The final stop was the waterfront city of Cascais. Ruben gave us the recommendation of a chicken restaurant (which we never found), and we were completely on our own again. Ruben took off, not to be seen again until the agreed to meeting time at the car. At least the sun peeked through the clouds for a bit of that visit.

Four adults cost just over $400...We could have done all the above for free just taking our rental car. Clearly, this operation is a SCAM and I strongly suggest you to either choose another tour group, or self direct.
By the way...I have thousands of followers on my Twitter/X account...and that will be the next place I alert people to this disgrace of a ""tour.""",1
God Level Quarterbreaker,"If you can avoid it better, scam, deceit and loot the castle of Sintra.
Terrible organization and information to access, if you get lost or lost it takes you at least half an hour to return to the starting point.
“They force you” to park in the town and take one of the taxis designed for that purpose (wagon, vintage, etc.), and here you start to spend money (7:50 per person), once you arrive near the castle A small bus awaits you to complete the climb of about 500 meters at €3 per person (one way, if you want to get off by bus later, another €3), oh if you're thirsty and don't bring water, wow 1.70 a 500 cl bottle.
In short, the castle is beautiful and picturesque, especially because of the location, but it is nothing out of this world and your wallet will thank you for it.",1
Guide did not follow the schedule,"Guide was not very informative at the stopping points, and did not follow the agreed times.

Do not attend a tour with more than one language,"Do not attend a tour with more than one language. We had 3 languages constantly pouring over the bus. English by far was the most we all understood but the tour guide made English the last language.

It was a complete failure when trying to understand the sight with all 3 languages. Often by the time English came the site was gone.

This was with Diana Tours that obviously was bought out by Grey Line tours.

The beginning of the tour boarding the bus was very confusing.",2
Go2Lisbon ruined our vacation!,"The tour company (Go2Lisbon) CANCELLED our tour without our knowledge even though it was already prepaid in advance. We were all dressed up for our 8:45 pick-up and when my wife called to confirm the time and place of pick-up, we were told it was previously cancelled by us. We were on a cruise ship and just arrived the day before so we did not have any direct contact with the tour company. We even received an e-mail and text message a day before that the tour is a go. The company could have reversed the cancellation as we still have over an hour before the pick-up time but they insisted it was cancelled. Accusing us of cancelling the tour ourselves was just too much of this company. Do not go to this company. They are no good.",1

Choose a different tour,"While our driver was congenial, and kind, he was not a guide in any sense of the word. He dropped us off at two different locations, we paid entrance fees, and he did not accompany us for the tour. He did not explain, unless asked, where we were in the city. Extremely disappointed.
He is a driver only! He should be listed as such- certainly not a guide.",1
Sintra and Cascais Private Tour Full Day,"We were extremely disappointed in this private full day tour for 4 people. The description indicated a driver and a private tour. There are currently 14 reviews of this tour on your site, all but one complimenting the wonderful tour guides their drivers were, so it was expected that our driver would be a guide as well. When we met the driver he did not introduce himself and said nothing about whether we had reserved our Pena Palace tickets in advance (we received a text at 9:30 the night before the tour indicating that we should purchase tickets on line for a certain time, but since it was so late we didn't see the information). Had he simply checked when we began the tour, we could have purchased them before we left.

Since there was basically silence in the car as we began our drive, we asked the driver to give us information about things. He made it clear that he would try to answer some of our questions but that we had only hired a driver, that he was not a guide, and if we had wanted a guide we should have booked another tour. Unfortunately, your only one star review echoed our sentiments ""this is no more than a chauffeur service.""

When we arrived at the Pena palace, he only then asked if we had our tickets. We spent over an hour and a half in the rain waiting to get an appointment to enter, and that affected the rest of the tour. From then on we were just dropped off at each of the other sites with literally no information and lost time for the other attractions.

With all due respect, if our driver was told he was only supposed to drive, he did an excellent job and the car was very nice and clean. We had a private Lisbon city tour the previous day with your company and had a wonderful driver/guide. We took several other similar private tours at other ports in Spain on our cruise and never had a similar problem.",1

Bad experience in Sintra with a Green Tours driver upping the price after the ride,"I was in Sintra walking between palaces when a Green Tours driver, Marco, offered to pick me up for 10 euros. I accepted, and he proceeded to drive me 5 minutes before saying the rest of the road is one way so I had to walk, which is fine. But then he informed me the the ""minimum"" charge was 20 and was intimidating until I paid. He then started shouting at me. Overall recommend avoiding this company, the whole 20 euro minimum thing feels like an intentional way to scam tourists.",1
Below average,Tour booked for midday. No one turned up. Took lots of phone calls and chasing before someone arrived in a vintage car/tuktuk almost half an hour late. Wasn’t what we booked but we were happy to get going with Chris our guide. Chris wasn’t very communicative until we reached each of the viewpoints. He was pleasant enough and polite. However I would not recommend this company as we do tuk tuks in every city and this was not a great experience.,2
Wouldn’t recommend street art tour,"Booked the street art tour requesting to see Bordelo 2 street art.

I wouldn’t recommend this company for street art tour, our booking was only received by driver minutes before we were meant to depart so there was no preparation",2

Fraude,"Good afternoon!
I come by this means to alert to a show that is being sold by Green Trekker: ""Year Pass Green Trekker - International Douro"" for the year 2024.
The walking guide is not from the region nor knows the trails of the same.
The program mentions ""dinner and anniversary party"", but when I informed myself, with the organizers of Green Trekker and with the venue of the mentioned dinner and party: ""Casas de Campo de Cimo da Quinta"", I noticed that there will be only a regular dinner and no year-end party is planned.
Carefully,
Graça Martinho",1

Who saw the guide??? I don't have a shadow of the refund!,Bad experience. The Italian guide in Porto did not show up to the appointment after a month that we had booked and of course already paid and made an appointment via wa for day 18 this writes that he was mistaken and that he thought it was 2 days later. The agency offered to do the tour another day but we were not available since we were no longer in Porto. I asked the guydezz agency several times via email and live chat for a refund of 140 euros paid but they didn't even reply anymore. Da evitare!!!!,1
Last minute cancellation.. no refund,"THANKS ! Your opinion matters.

Service canceled and service non-existent

What can I say about this company?
To avoid !
We have contracted 5 services 1 month in advance for visits to Lisbon:
- 2 airport transfers: carried out by less expensive providers, one of them had to be changed because he was driving a Fiat 500...not easy for luggage.
- 1 private tour transported to Sintra, canceled on the day of the service. We are still waiting for the refund 2 weeks later.
- 2 private tours with guide for a half-day walking tour in Lisbon. The guide, although competent, looked more like a homeless person than a guide!

For the rest, all communications (connected with the guides) are made via WhatsApp at the last minute.
The service is pitiful.
Run away !",1
The worst place in any city on the planet.,It's the worst place on the planet. Pure trash. Unpaid American food for exorbitant prices. Tourist place with NO attractive. Ideal for idiots who buy one of their shirts at every place they visit. FUJA.,1
I would never return:(,"The place well, the service good but the food very regulating. Burnt and bland burgers. :(expensive prices for quality.",2
Bad,"The service was good but the food was terrible. I ordered the mini Burger and I Asked for well done but they came out almost RAW at my first bite and blood in my plate. I returned them and they offered me free desert but I was not hungry anymore so they broth me the bill with no compensation , The manager told me he took the temperature after we returned the burgers (15 min later) and they were ok according to him . Finally they credited me the replacing Flatbread we ordered but I had
to argue with him . This was my 54th HardRock in the word and the worst one I've everbeen. I should had taken a picture of the burgers. He kept my bill of 50$ because he forgot to add my unity card.",2
Jamás volvere,"La comida no estuvo mal, camarero simpático aunque a una compañera de viaje le llegó la comida cuando ya habías terminado el resto, pero eso sí a la hora de pagar nos clavo un puñal por la espalda contándonos no sé qué royo con el iva
Así que no pienso volver (muy muy mal)",2
NO LO RECOMIENDO,"He estado en muchos hard rocks por el mundo y este me ha resultado el peor de todos los visitados.
La comida era mala(todos los platos que comimos no nos gustaron).El servicio muy lento y hacia mucho calor.No volveré a este establecimiento.",2
A mai più rivederci,"Erano anni che non entravo in un Hard Rock Cafè. I ricordi erano buoni. Sandwich enormi e buoni e tanta cortesia. Non so cosa sia successo: se le cose cambino da città a città o se siano i tempi a essere cambiati. Cortesia solo quando si entra la qualità del cibo (cheese burger con patate fritte) è decisamente peggiorata. Il sandwich si avvicina per qualità a quelli delle peggiori catene di cui non si può fare il nome, e le patate fritte erano nere (sarebbe ora di cambiare l'olio forse). I prezzi sono rimasti alti come una volta (burger, patate fritte e acqua gasata più di 20 euro). A mai più rivederci",1
"Nie wieder, absoluter Reinfall über dieses Portal","Absolute Katastrophe, 3 Personen wurden gebucht übermittelt nur 2, totaler Chaos beim Check in , erst wurde die normale Karte an den Tisch gebracht man wurde normal freundlich bedient, nach Nachfrage wir haben das Gold Menü bestellt ging es los. Fragezeichen auf den Gesichtern die Karte wurde weggenommen , abgespeckte Version auf portugiesisch gebracht ,Auswahl an 2 burgern, chicken Sandwich und zum Nachtisch ein browni, super ein kaltgetränk durften wir uns auch noch aussuchen. Managerin kam an den Tisch und machte ein Screenshot auf ihrem Handy von meiner Buchung auf meinem Handy. Sorry aber wir haben vielleicht 3 Euro gespart ,kamen uns aber vor wie 2. Klasse ......nie wieder und kann jeden nur davon abraten,geht lieber normal da hin ohne diesem tourinepp ....PS essen war nicht gut,browni ohne Sahne nicht genießbar und einer von uns in der Nacht auch noch magenkrämpfe",1
To avoid Harley-Davidson Lisbon Concession,"While the Concession HD of Algarve is excellent they helped us on a clutch problem of one of the 11 Bécanes of the RoadTrip Disassembly and Adjustment and 0 yes Zero Euro that of Lisbon with a lacerated tire they balked to make the change (30mn).We had to insist to have it only the next day at the end of the morning and invoice 480 Euros.At this price I change 2 tires of my SUV Lexus and in addition they remade the level of oil not necessary but invoiced while an upgrade should not be.
This is the beautiful image of Harley-Davidson Lisbon.
No commercial gestures, no troubleshooting almost had to pray for him to do it when it blocked Harley.
And an exorbitant bill.
You tarnish the image of the Brand and your Country.",1
Scam....Beware,This website is a scam.....Beware if you consider. Customer service is non existent.....they are terrible and would not recommend to anyone.,1
Headout Tickets Warning,Do Not Use This Company!!!! You will be scammed and not be able to use attraction tickets as expected online or via App. It is a third party vendor and difficult to get assistance.,1
"Fraudulent sale of tickets to the Quinta da Regaleira, in Sintra - Portugal","Fraude. Golpe. We bought the tickets and we received a message (email) with a QR code with instructions to find a person who would accompany us to the entrance of Quinta. There was no one at the place/time set. We download the app, where the purchase confirmation appears, only. We photographed the empty place, waited for more than half an hour and headed to the gate of Quinta da Regaleira where an employee told us that the QR code had no ticket value, and that other people had been victims of the same blow. Police case, she says. We bought the tickets again at Quinta's box office. We entered an hour and a half after the scheduled time. This delay in programming hurt us very much, we left Lisbon early and intended to arrive in Porto in the late afternoon. It was not possible because, in fact, Quinta is beautiful and there is a lot to see. We recommend other travellers to check the Quinta da Regaleira website and, if possible, shop directly at the ticket office there. For some reason, which only this hacked world can explain, this company was the first of the list of search results that we made (subject: purchase of tickets for the Quinta da Regaleira) to buy the ticket, which led us to the ""scheme"" of the purchase to ""avoid queues"". I complained a lot, asked for the return of what I paid (more than forty euros for two tickets that cost me, at the Quinta ticket office, eighteen euros) and they, almost two months later, insist on the version that everything happened normally and we simply ""did not see"" the guide. It would be very good if some kind of supervision from a Portuguese government agency could punish this kind of coup.",1
Scam company - AVOID,Warning!!! Scam company! Go to the proper site for tickets 🚩🚩🚩🚩 I accidentally used them for Sintra and the guys at the door said there was a lot of problems w this company. They will charge you a lot extra for tickets and the I did not even get the audioguide ordered. Customer service is also terrible,1
Awful,Extremely poor service. They charge you credit card but doesn’t issue ticket or send them by email. A lot of hassle to get your money back. Big scam. Stay away and book directly!!,1
"Few professionals, poorly educated, gyms with terrible conditions","Avoid this gym at all costs. The experience was disgusting from beginning to end. The facilities are in a state of complete abandonment: dirty bathrooms, rusty and sewage-smelling showers, broken and dirty boxes, constantly wet flooring. It is unacceptable for a space dedicated to health to function at this level of loose.

The equipment is outdated, poorly preserved and often damaged. Obviously, there is no plan for their maintenance.

The worst of all? The people. Completely undereducated, arrogant and without any professional training. Talk to customers like they're doing a favor by being there. A true example of how not to treat customers.

The feeling with which you leave this gym is of frustration, anger and disgust. I never thought a place with this level of disrespect for customers and hygiene could be open to the public. A miserable experience and a screaming example of mismanagement.

Don’t waste your time (or money). Fiquem longe.",1
Manager of Viana do Castelo branch seems to be racist,"During our 3 years of living in Portugal, we have encountered very friendly and welcoming people, but a very unpleasant exception was the manager of the Solinca club in Viana do Castelo.

While my wife was exercising on the exercise machine, another client intervened (which is against the rules of the sports club) and created a conflict situation, in which I was forced to intervene. When trying to clarify the situation with the manager (I don’t remember the name) of the club, we encountered a very biased (not in our favor) attitude from the manager, who decided to terminate our membership in the club unilaterally, and this despite the fact that the instigators of the conflict were other clients.

But the most unpleasant experience for us was the mocking and contemptuous tone of the conversation from the manager, where she directly made it clear that she did not care at all who was the instigator of the conflict, and without even listening to us, she made a decision in favor of the other side of the conflict. Based on this, and the fact that we are from Ukraine, the conclusion suggests itself that the manager has racist views either towards Ukrainians or foreigners in general.",1
Disappointing,"A Club that invites members to look for “another solution for their life” when faced with the impossibility of scheduling classes, blocking access to the App for those who arrive 2 or 3 minutes BEFORE a scheduled class. A Club that punishes members for arriving 2 or 3 minutes before a class, without even being late! Penalizing the partners with the inability to access the prior class marking by the App. It really is a good reason to look for another alternative even if this Club is next door. In a word only: Disappointing!!",2
Solinca Linda-a-Velha,"Solinca Linda-a-Velha, never answer the cell phone. App with errors and I am today without being able to book a class in the App.
Women's bathrooms still like they were when it was Calories. There are no banks near the cabins to sit, shower doors are to laugh and qd it is necessary to resolve something, just going physically there and receive the antipathy of some employees.",1
Just don't!!!,"Solinca Oeiras. I do not have any pleasure in writing this review, which is already late, but as I know more and more people with my opinion and then weave the same, here it goes. Do not expect me to be serious or serious in compliance with the contractual conditions. We can sign the contract on the day we meet the ginasio (in this case solinca oeiras), and there are few people, can do a workout... ok....

I've been there, or at least tried to train there for six months. The subscription is annual so reaching a limit of subscribers they should stop accepting people. On the contrary, promos are so many that after 10 days no one can train. There is queue for machines for 2 and 3 people !!!! To the banks, to the hoarders...

I bought a pack of 20 workouts with PT (the only sympathetic experience of Solinca but was not there to make friends and much less pay expensive to make them...) and didn't even have room to train, to the point that I couldn't do an exercise beyond climbing the stairs to get to the room, had to come away. Someone I told about the ginasio had to come away. I left PT classes for doing, because there were weeks when I went 3 times and went back without training. It's absurd. But be careful, don't be fooled. The conditions at the time of the contract (what is included and valid) will ⁇ not be the same as you will encounter on a daily basis so the annual signature / contract is easily disassembled. Nothing else could be expected. It's literally cat by leopard. At the end of this everything remains the dishonesty of those who are deceiving the customer and do everything to ⁇ too ambitious sales goals. They didn't answer me an email, a phone call or the respondents were always busy if I wanted to talk to them. It has long been known that some group classes are fully booked and filled with months in advance. What a lack of seriousness and frontality. A shame. It is not ginasio for those who want and like to train.",1
Horrible and unprofessional,"This is absolutely terrible experience. Mostly because of unprofessional staff. We singed up a contract and asked if we want to break it how do we do it. They said you need a proof that you lost a job/ got sick, or changed address 50km away from the gym or just tell us 30 days in advance. With all the mess in immigration system in Portugal, our residencies expired and we couldn’t renew it, so we had to fly back home. I came to the receptionist in April and explained the situation, she said that they need a proof. We send our expired visas. Not enough. Email, after email, chasing us and trying to charge when we are not even in the country anymore. After a month, we received our bills in home country and sent it to Solinca. They are still trying to charge us! This is ridiculous. The gym itself isn’t worth it. The changing rooms are disgusting, equipment is crowded and staff is useless. 10 instructors walking around and checking if you have a towel-that all they know!",1
Yoga classes are often committed to the intensity of the music coming from the rooms on the same floor.,"After a year of being away, I return to the Solinca do Lumiar gym and continue to struggle to recognize the logic with which Yoga classes are scheduled at the same time as extremely noisy classes in the rooms next door. I think there is a huge lack of respect towards clients who consider the activity a priority in their routine and also towards the excellence of Professor Jorge Neves. Here, Yoga is treated by management as an imported activity, to be marketed in a context completely denatured from its oriental and spiritual origin. Imposing himself in this approach to the subject, Professor Jorge, despite the absurd logistics to which he is subjected and in apparent polite silence towards this issue, is still an excellent communicator of the subject, even though he notices that sometimes the class is significantly disturbed. from the outside, and it is for this reason that I abandon my resistance to leaving a criticism of Solinca here, as I also praise the professor for accepting to work in these conditions and the stance he takes. I am happy that, having signed up at the gym again, I see that he still teaches here, but unfortunately I recognize that the conditions are still the same, even though I have noticed that many other customers have already criticized this management. If the gym does not respond to a recurring criticism from customers, I am now aware of what other criticisms it will not respond to as well. I value being in a place where the customer is not only heard, but also understood and, finally, where problems are resolved.",1
Péssima experiência,"Clube péssimo! O do Centro Comercial do Colombo não tem espaço adequado para um clube. Espaços sem ventilação adequada. Material de uso para os treinos velhos, gastos.

Didn’t deliver car on time,The worst experience ever ! I had a reservation at 1 pm and got there at 1:03 pm . They said they are going to have lunch and will be back at 2:30 pm . I kindly asked to give as a car now. The appointment was booked at 1 pm which means they booked me already at lunch time . The employees didn’t care at all about this situation. They closed the door and went for lunch for one and half hour. I had scheduled other things in Porto and and I will be late because of it. I’m with a young child which makes it more difficult to wait that long … do not recommend anyone this place !,1

Run away!,"Horrible customer experience.. horrible car service… employe and manager with no intention to please paying customers.

Do Not Rent From Hertz in Portugal,"Wish there were a lower rating. I rented a regular car but when I went to pick it up they offered my a lux Polestar 2 fully electric vehicle. We were driving from Lisbon to Porto so i was concerned about the range. And i told him I'd never driven a
electric car. The guy said Don't Worry! There are charging stations everywhere. He told us to download an app. And if the car needed a top off, charge it while we had lunch. We drove a 1/3 of the way and 1/2 of the charge was gone. Went to our next stop and the charging station we found on the app didnt exist. Found another one and searched everywhere for the charging cable but couldn't find it. Called Hertz and were told we needed to charge the car. Duh. Then they said they needed to send roadside assistance because no one there, it turned out, had any idea how to charge an electric car. Meanwhile, we tried a 2nd charging station cuz it seemed the 1st one didnt work. Called Hertz again. And again. And again. They kept transferring and dropping the call. Finally they had someone from Polestar call me and he also said Hertz had to send roadside assistance. Meanwhile, our day trip is slipping and it didn't work. Meanwhile, we can't reach Hertz. Strangers stepped in to help us find the charging cable and to read the instructions on the Portuguese only charging stations. Eventually we closed and locked the car to go wait in the shade for help. We walked away and the car started charging. Seriously? No one could tell us to do this? Got the car to 54% while we visited amonastery for an hour. Should have been more than enough to get us to our destination. Nope. We had to limp along in the slow lane way below the speed limit for and hour to get there with a tiny charge left. When I returned the car they were rude, made me wait, then refused to make it right in any way. I'm a Hertz Gold Plus Member. Be warned! Do NOT rent from Hertz in Portugal. Or if you must, do not accept a fully electric car.",1
UNETHICAL SERVICE - PROMISING AMOUNT OF RENTAL RECORD WAS DOUBLED IN THE FINAL INVOICE WITHOUT OUR CONCENT AND AWARENESS,"BE CAREFULL! they get your money with an initial spoken deal, and once they have the info of your credit card they are charging you more that the deal you have communicated!! AWFUL-UNETHICAL SERVICE, BE CAUTIOUS!!

The story:

The rental agreement we made for 2 days, engaged our Credit card with the total amount of 258 € & the car that they would give us was an electric.

After having already paid, the employee told us that a battery of this electric car is about 300km & because this was limited for us ( since we wanted to go more miles )we asked to change the car with a car with gas.

The employee told us that he will upgrade us with another car & the extra cost will be only the gas, and instead of 70 € we will pay 100 € for the gas ( 100 – 70 = 30 € , so we should pay 258 € + 30 € = 288 € ).

BUT, out of his confusion he asked us to pay 350 € AGAIN without cancelling the previous transaction ( I had a credit card limit so thankfully this transaction did not happen).

I was trying to explain the difference etc but then we asked for the supervisor to solve the misunderstanding.

After discussing with the employees supervisor, she reassured us (after asking her multiple times whether there are any extra costs for the car upgrade & her answer was that the price of 258 € would be the total one) that for this upgrade the price & the costs will not change.

I was finally charged 350 € where they added up additional fees that were already added on the initial rental record agreement, without informing us from the beginning and of course LYING TO US that we will pay less.

The conclusion

Of course i have communicated with their customer service this was their response :
"" I regret to inform you that the charges billed are valid based on the location response""

They do not even admit their miss communication and miss management & they just reply back this is it accept it!

Nobody should accept this kind of treatment and be sure that we are never going to use your ""services"" ever again.",1

Pleasant tour but guide Totally disrespectful and unpleasant to the Portuguese culture,"On a tour held today July 19, 25, although the route was pleasant, the experience was deeply disappointing and unpleasant due to the guide “Maria”.

He spoke mostly Spanish, even with many Portuguese on board, which made the experience less inclusive.

In addition, there was no cultural rigor, told distorted stories and disrespectful jokes, such as:

That the Christ King in Lisbon is smaller than that of Brazil because the builder “fled with the money and a girlfriend”;

That Christ the Redeemer lost two fingers in a storm, and that of Lisbon “proves that there is no hell that breaks him”;

That the Portuguese were “smart” and bended the line of the Treaty of Tordesillas to seize Brazil.

All this was said with a jokeful tone and without any cultural or historical concern.

When searching, we realized that there are several identical reports with other HIPPOtrip guides, which raises serious doubts about the company's script.

The idea of the tour is fun, but communication urgently needs more respect, rigor and sensitivity for visitors — especially the Portuguese.",1
Not recommended,"Hardly anything seen, as it was poorly possible through the vehicle. Presenter was more interested in entertainment than information. Not recommended",1
Entertaining but not very informative,"The route within the city is unfortunately not very interesting, you can see only a few real sights. The highlight is the ride in the water, where you can see only two Torres and not the cityscape of Lisbon. We had a very nice, always cheerful and striving tour guide (Maria) who did a lot of show and spread good vibes, but that only belied the few real highlights. Unfortunately, the tour had little to do with a good informative city tour. The Portuguese statements were also much more detailed than the English statements.",2
Skip this tour.,"Well, we expected an informative tour from Tanya and Carlos but what we got was a lets see if we can scare the pedistrians. We rode around and Tanya would yell Hippo Hippo and our response was Hurray! This was done all trip with very little history of the town or information about anything. It would have better been billed as a ""Scare tour of Lisbon"". You could turn this into a booze cruise tour and then all that would be fun but not what we expected.",2
Tickets cancelled as we were waiting to board,"Our booking was cancelled after we paid, as we were waiting to board!
We had booked our ticket in advance and planned our afternoon around the trip. We got to reception, they did have our booking (they checked our name), we paid for our tickets, we went to await boarding… and then after all that, we were told that our tickets had been cancelled! No explanation given, except that there was suddenly no more room on the boat. This is despite the fact we had a booking AND we’d just paid for our tickets! So it seems that booking a ticket does not guarantee you a place on the boat at all. This could have been due to a large tour group of tourists coming in.
They did not have room on another trip until many hours later, so we had to ask for a refund. We were left without an alternative to entertain the kids, and still unsure when / whether the refund will appear on my card. Rubbish customer experience.",1

Fatal and unpleasant experience !!!!,"The driver of the vehicle during the introduction of the amphibious vehicle into the water did so at a high speed which caused the water to enter unexpectedly causing damage to the passengers of my family:

1) first of all, the water literally soaked the hearing aids I wear in my ears, wetting them and rendering them unusable. These prostheses are electronic devices that cannot receive water directly.

2) the cell phones that we were carrying in our hands also got wet and were affected by the water.

3) the whole family was soaked with water, leaving our clothes completely wet and with a humidity that is not suitable to continue the trip.

At no time, neither during the boarding of the vehicle, nor during the course of the trip, nor at the ticket window itself, did your company inform about the risk of getting wet or directly wet or our belongings.
Not even on their website do they indicate that passengers with any type of electronic devices should safeguard their belongings for risk of being wet or receiving water directly during the trip.

In short a fatal and unpleasant experience that ruined our day !!! !!!
I do not recommend it at all",1
Hippo Hippo with surprises,"Be careful if you are carrying valuables, we were not warned that you could get wet when entering the sea.The entrance was abrupt and we got wet whole.

Instead, I Trip Tip you to take an excursion in the Tagus River simply because the view from the river is beautiful, especially at the Belém Tower.",2
Buying a ticket doesn't get the trip,Unbelievable and Ridiculous. After paying €200 we were told we have to make separately a reservation. Buying a ticket should lead to a reservation. Extremely disappointing for the children. Nothing on any third party website tells us that a separate reservation is needed.,1
Very disappointing,We found it very unfortunate that the guide did not make a minimum of effort to translate even the names of the monuments into French. Not a single word has been translated. So we wasted 1h30 of our time and money,2

We wanted to see Torre de Belem and the monument from the river...
We had specifically asked the day before what would happen if the wind was forecast to be strong. We were told that we would be informed if the tour was not possible. The captain would decide that.
On the day of the tour: no information, so we made the long journey. No information when we registered that the tour could not take place as planned. When we were sitting in the 'bus' we were told that the tour would change 'slightly' because of the weather, but that we would spend enough time in the water.
In the end we had a short tour on land around the harbor (and the comments were mostly in Portuguese and only a few sentences in English), and then we drove into the water 3 times(!) in the harbor area, then we turned around and went back to land. That was it! We paid over 170€ for that... a disgrace! A waste of time and money!!!",1
Awful for young children,"I drove on the highway for one hour to take my son on this tour (it’s not really my kind of thing but I thought he would enjoy it). 3 year old children are allowed but there was nothing on their website that said children have to be at least 1.50m to be able to see anything. Usually children are allowed to on your lap in buses or boats, but not on this tour and there’s no warning about it not being suitable for young children. They just have to sit there and watch something on your phone or something for more than an hour. Definitely a wasted afternoon",1
Terrible,"Loud, shrill, terrible. The lady at the microphone talks faster than a fan. You can't understand a word. I kept asking myself during the trip how you could turn this woman off. Or what drugs she had taken to be able to talk at this speed for 90 minutes without a break. Then sometimes some disco music plays. And at an unbearable volume. And then you're supposed to scream and throw your arms up in the air.

If you want to experience a quiet city tour, this is definitely not the place for you. It was not announced beforehand that this was a shrill party trip with bad Ibiza animation. This is for stoned party people who already have constant headaches.

People with cardiovascular problems or high blood pressure could be in mortal danger during this spectacle. What a nightmare.",1

It was more walking than talking.,"I wish I could leave a better review, but the guide will either makes or breaks your experience. our tour guide was Beatriz and the tour was more walking that talking.

Very disappointed in canceled tours,"This company canceled two different walking tours on two different days due to lack of the specified number of recipients required to take the tour. For one of the tours, it was canceled after I showed up at the meeting point. While I understand there is a minimum requirement for this particular company to perform the tour, as a tourist you need to know this because like me, you probably will plan your days around activities like this. Due to their cancellation, I missed out on a day where I could have went to Sintra or at least planned other activities within Lisbon. Rather, I showed up on time mid-day just to have the tour canceled. Maybe this isn’t a problem during the main tourist season, but in January this happened to me twice. My best advice is to book with a company or individual that doesn’t have a minimum requirement of walkers for a walking tour, otherwise you may end up like me and canceled on the spot.",1

Odd,"Pastel de Nata Pastry Class

Lisbon

Funniest experience but not what expected

915055462

I had high hopes for this cooking class. My interactions with the owner beforehand were pleasant. She contacted me a couple of days before our scheduled class to reschedule because we would be unable to get to her location in Belem because of the Pope’s visit.

We arrived about 15 minutes early and the staff on hand was not happy about that. Reluctantly they let us in to sit and wait. They didn’t greet us or provide any introduction at any time.

Instead of the 8 participants as the website states there were 12 of us. I assume that was because others were rescheduled too. This only impacted us because it felt rushed.

The lead instructor was quite rude and harsh, shaming us if our product was not done perfectly. Once I got over that I found it hilarious and my family spent the next 2 hours laughing at the ridiculousness of the class. When the instructor didn't like the way someone was doing something she took over for them and completed the task. This is a casual cooking class not culinary school. I paid for the opportunity to give it a try, not to have a perfect finished pastel de Nata but to try my hand at making the pastry.

There was not enough water or juice for the 12 participants. We were provided with 2 pastel de Nata’s - which were the best tasting ones for the trip - we sat at the table for a while while the staff began preparing for what we can assume was the next class. They did not communicate with us at all. We asked if we were done and they replied yes, so they gave us pastry to take with us, which was very nice and we were on our way. All in all the strangest cooking class I have ever taken; yet my family has laughed more about this experience than any other.",2

Maybe I didn't understand it well,"Sculpture (if it can be defined as such) by Rui Chafes created in 1998 for the Lisbon expo and made up of two empty iron tubes 9 meters long and painted dark, resting on supports and arranged at an acute angle to each other. From afar they might seem like two cannons, also because they are not cylinders but truncated cones. Open on both sides, they should serve as a sounding board for the wind that possibly passes through or for the voice if someone tries to speak inside. Maybe a child might find them interesting, but they didn't say anything to me. They are located near the Portuguese Pavilion, in the open space just to the south of the latter.",2
WATCH OUT FOR THE PARROT,"Bite by Chico on the hands by Amalia's parrot, I am shocked by the attitude of the staff, I had to go to a pharmacy for treatment. The guide remonstrated with me rather than asking me how I was doing. She told me that this is the first time that it happens, it's not true, another comment on google says the opposite. Real bad faith. No proposal to reimburse me for the cost of the ticket or pharmacy fees. I would contact the Portuguese Ministry of Tourism to see if it is normal for a wild animal to be free in Portugal amongst customers.",1

Para los que estamos de paso, los minutos cuentan y quizás era nuestra única oportunidad de visitar un determinado lugar. No pienso recomendar a este museo cuando mis conocidos viajen a Lisboa.

Even though it has a monumental façade (which is not in excellent condition), I advise against coming here if you are not sure of finding it open.",2
Horrible,"I think it is important to share about my recent experience on my sister and I’s two week trip to Athens Greece. Upon arrival on July 14th we were met at the airport by Kira our local coordinator. I was lucky that I had done a video call with her before leaving the states or I would not have had any idea who to meet. On the IVHQ website it shows that someone picking us up would have a sign identifying themselves. This was not the case. She placed us in a taxi and sent us to the hostel which is in a less than ideal neighborhood but we tried to keep an open mind. We were not given a code to the door and were left out on the street with all our luggage for well over 20 minutes before someone came to let us in. During this time I used WhatsApp to reach out to Kira to attempt to figure out how to get in. She did not respond to the text for over an hour  and when she did it was after I messaged letting her know we figured it out. We were placed in a room with 10 other girls, not an issue. If the AC worked, which it did not. During our pre arrival call Kira had stated due to the fact my sister who is 18 was traveling with me that she had ensured we would be in the same bunk, and that our volunteer shifts would be the same. 

At bed assignments we were not placed in the same bunk. This again was fine. Orientation was Monday morning we had no issues this day other than the AC and it being no joke 95 degrees in our room. Tuesday Kira met the four of us that were in the community support program we walked about 20 minutes to the first location which was a Kitchen. After meeting the team there we walked another 15 minutes to the social cafe, we were told what we would be doing and that the buildings surrounding the cafe were refugee housing. We then received the schedule for the next two weeks, my sister and I were on opposite shifts for every single day. I asked the other two girls first if they would be okay with switching so that we could work together and travel together. They had no issue with this and then I spoke to Kira who also said as long as the girls were okay with it then she was as well. 

Wednesday morning I woke up very sick. I messaged Kira “Good morning Kira, just wanted to let you know last night I started feeling very sick. Sore throat, stuffy nose. My sister and I went to bed about 11pm and I slept until 1115 this morning. We’re about to head to our placement after heading to the pharmacy but just wanted to let you know” I was under the impression that if I started to get sick that it would be Kira’s job to get me a doctors appointment and note since I was working with food at my placement, Kira would never text me back about not feeling well. Over the next two days. 7/12 girls in our room would be sick. Non of which would receive any medical attention. 

Again all with no air conditioning and being told it was only this hot because of how many girls were in the room. Friday we elected to get an airbnb for the weekend after not being at the hostel for one day I started feeling better we returned Sunday night and after one night I woke up sick again. The air conditioning had been making dripping noises and I had made comments about being worried about mold and that being why so many of us were feeling bad just at the hostel.

I ran into Kira on the street Monday morning. She asked me how I was feeling and I told her that I only was feeling really sick in the mornings and after spending time in the room she nodded and walked away. My sister and I carried on and went to our placement at the cafe. 

The cafe was an awful experience. We were not shown how to do anything and then were just thrown into serving the refugee community. At one point the leader there took my sister and had her go to the rooftop to do service up there. It was over 100 degrees this day, he did not allow her to bring her phone, or grab water before heading up. At this same time the food from Kitchen arrived and the cafe had given out more tickets than the meals they ordered so about 50 people did not receive a meal. Which led to screaming, and pure chaos. I said I needed a moment because honestly I was scared we were telling people who we did not speak there language we had no food for them and with good reason they were upset. People began screaming and were then eating left overs out of the trash. 

At the end of our 7 hour shift at which we did not take any breaks during, at the time we were scheduled to leave went to the leader and asked if there was anything else we could help with since it was our time to leave or if we were good to head out. He looked at her and told her to get back in the kitchen. We ended up working 8.5 hours this day. 

By the end of Monday we felt defeated. We were not spoken to with any appreciation, or respect by the organization we came and spent thousands of dollars to help. We weren’t sleeping from the heat in our room we were exhausted. We decided Monday we were going to book an Airbnb for the rest of the week so that at least we would not be exhausted for placement. I texted Kira to let her know. 

At the same time in the group chat this message was sent by another volunteer “Hey is the A/c being fixed.
It's unbearable.
People are sick, no one is getting any sleep.
Girls are leaving to go stay somewhere else, another is leaving the program early.
We need this problem fixed asap!!!” 

They had someone there that day to fix the ac but we had already paid for an airbnb. When fixing it there was mold discovered inside the unit. Only took over a week of everyone complaining for something to finally be done. 

Tuesday my sister and I both wanted to cry thinking about going to the cafe. We messaged Kira stating we would like to go over things that we were experiencing before returning and that we would prefer to work at the Kitchen. She did not reply for almost and hour and we did not go to the cafe as we had stated we would not until she spoke with us. At this point we had been in Greece for 10 days and had seen Kira at most two hours. Kira was very disrespectful and not interested in hearing what was going on. She said we were disrespectful, that we don’t do what we say we will, and pretty much that all of our concerns were not real. 

After arguing with Kira for an hour and not getting anywhere we said that the conversation was not going anywhere and we were not resolving anything so please remove us from the program. 

A few hours later is when we received text in the group chat. From quality manager also pretty much calling us liars.

I have all of the texts Kira cannot pretend that no one was complaining to her about anything or asking for help. 

Two hours after that text was sent Kira messaged me privately and notified me and my sister that we was no longer allowed at the hostel. Which was fine since we had already secured other housing thank gosh. I’m not sure what we would have done if we hadn’t been proactive or if we did not have the money to leave. But over the next three days. 6 other volunteers would be “expelled” and allowed to eat and sleep at the hostel. Which we paid for. 

This has been overall one of the most awful experiences I have ever had. After leaving placement we also discovered that the “refugee housing” that is around the cafe are actually brothels. And that area is known for sex trafficking and prostitution. The lack of transparency for 18 year old women walking alone here is absolutely astounding. 

Nothing that was promised in my package was how it was there. From the moment I entered the country, emails were sent from almost every one who was there as well over the next few weeks. Because this was devastating on the treatment and lack of communication and support. 

The only person who was any help was David, that man truly cares about the people staying at the hostel, he checked in and did everything in his power to help. He deserves a raise and a promotion. 

I spent the last month asking for a one week refund. Which has now been denied because they are now claiming we were the issue not this horrible program. Waste of money.",1
Not worth it,"Overall a very disappointing experience. I did one week of youth support in Lisbon. My main issue is with the cost and ImpacTrip’s refund policy. The program is already quite costly but I thought it would be worth it due to a week of free accommodation and food plus the opportunity to volunteer which I had never done before. The cost includes an airport pickup if you arrive on the Sunday prior to your week starting. I was initially meant to arrive on Sunday but had last minute itinerary changes due to severe weather that meant I had to change my flight to a different date. My issue was not that I could not get the airport pick up. My issue was that they refused to refund me for a service I never ended up using due to circumstances out of my control. I have emailed and texted ImpacTrip several times asking for a refund or at least an explanation as to where my money is going to go. They responded once saying it is not a part of their policy and could not provide an explanation as to where my money is now going. This is about £45 and as a young backpacker this is a lot of money to me. I think it is unethical and unfair that a volunteering organisation to whom I have given my money and time is happy to keep money for a service I never used. I find it incredibly rude that they can’t even give me an explanation as to where this money has now gone nor an apology.

Secondly, not an issue as such but more advice. It is advertised that volunteers have to speak English. At the after school care, neither staff or kids spoke much English. Language classes are offered during your week of volunteering. However, I had already spent £550 for this week and this was out of my price range. Also, as I thought English was the required language I did not think this would be necessary. It is also advertised that you can offer to teach English in an informal way to the kids. However, the afternoons are already organised by the teachers weeks prior. I understand the necessity for this having worked in after school care myself at home. However, it just really limited my opportunity to interact with the kids. In addition to the language barrier I really felt like an outsider. I am not blaming anyone for the language barrier or trying to suggest the school should know English. I know we are volunteering in disadvantaged areas which makes this really hard. I just wish someone had told me before that this program would be better suited to people who know Portuguese or are trying to learn Portuguese. In fact, interacting with young kids would be a great way if you are a beginner Portuguese learner :)

Another frustrating experience was transporting to volunteering. I know the website states you should be expected to travel to your volunteering venue. However, I thought this would be within walking distance or a short bus/train ride. I had to take 1.5hrs worth of public transport each way and also pay for this myself. This ended up being 50€ for the week. Again, while I understand this is advertised, it was more expensive than I thought. Also, while Lisbon is safe city, it is always worries me to have to travel so far on my own as a solo female traveller at night. Some volunteers were younger than 18 and raised this with ImpacTrip who simply stated that they should have known they had to travel to and from volunteering on their own. I think that’s quite a harsh explanation to someone who’s literally a child on their own in a foreign city.

Finally, the staff at the hostel were rude and unaccommodating. I did not feel welcome and was made to feel like everything was such a chore for them to do. This is with the exemption of the cleaners who do a very thorough job. The hostel is really clean which is always nice. The linen is clean and there are fresh towels for volunteers which is a bonus. In terms of food, it is advertised in the program that the food is prepared on site which it isn’t. It’s prepared in another kitchen and brought to the hostel you stay at. This doesn’t apply to me, but there were several people with severe food allergies such as coeliac disease who were often not accommodated. The hostel staff would tell them their food was prepared with the other food and that it was still fine to eat. Some days there were no GF or allergy-friendly options available and they were told to find their own meals for the day even though food is part of the cost.

As said, it is a shame that this was overall a disappointing experience. I think there is a lot of potential for this to be a lot better and the positive volunteering experience people are looking for.",1

"bad van, illegal additional charges, disgusting customer service","DO NOT HIRE FROM INDIE CAMPERS!! they are cons. I rented a caravan in Barcelona for a festival. First of all, the thing that they don't tell you in the website - is that in order to take the van you need to pay a deposit (in addition to the rental and insurance price), in my case 2000 euros, and they will do everything in order to not give it back.
In my first day of renting the gas was leaked and the fridge died - and all the food got spoiled. I got back to them to fix it so I lost my first day. Then we went to the festival - in the second day the leisure battery died and stopped charging. We had already been in the festival area so couldn't get out with the vehicle. I talked to the chat support nonstop to find a solution for us but they don't care - they told me to go and buy a battery. I spent my hole 10 days of rental without electricity. Then when I returned back the caravan - the guy at the station looked at it and took some pictures, said it's ok and I can go, and that I will get my deposit back in 2 days. Of course I didn't got it back, but instead, 2 weeks after I got an email from them saying they charged me extra 1200 euros for a plastic damage (that wasn't there when I returned it). what???? It's unacceptable to charge more after my rental is over and we already agreed that there are no damages. I wrote to their support in every channel possible, filled a claim, sent videos and nothing, they are ignoring everything. I tried to cancel the transaction through the credit card company but they say they can't. the least I can do is to warn others not to rent from them",1

"Dead battery, ruined experience and poor customer service","Just before we left the pick up site we noticed that the oil light was on as there was no oil. This was then over filled so the oil light was on (and burning smell) the whole time.

Our Indie Camper had a dead battery (they told us it would last a few days, if not the whole trip as we were driving a long way without needing to be charged). We raised this issue on the support line to be told we just needed to charge it. We paid to stay at a campsite, charged it for 12 hours for it to be dead within an hour of it coming off charge again. This meant the water could not be used (including for washing up, toilet or shower as the pump wouldn't then work), the electricity in the van could not be used for obvious reasons. Bearing in mind a camper with a toilet/shower costs considerably more than a camper without, we got no use of this because of them not checking the battery. We paid an excess for a duvet set, for it to not include a duvet. We were in the mountains and very cold because of this the whole trip. They are not willing to give us a refund other than £35 (which they have not actually given us), which is an insult given that a van without toilet/shower was considerably less (we're talking C. £500 for the equivalent time), that we paid an additional campsite fee and generally found it quite stressful that this was not the experience we paid a lot of money for.

The person who greeted us at the end was nice, and they confirmed that the battery was dead and we would be adequately compensated. Instead, we have been told all we can get is £35 back, they are not paying us this and are now ignoring all messages that we send them.

I would not book again with Indie Campers and suggest people book with caution.",1

Have booked before and experience was very good, but if they can cancel with 2 days notice I will certainly not book again and would not recommend.",1
Horrible Experience and Customer Service,"Let me start off by saying I don’t usually write reviews. The service provided by Indie Van was so atrocious that I felt the need. My wife and I rented a van in Las Vegas for a trip to Great Basin, Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks from April 1 through April 11. The overnight low temperature in Great Basin the first night was 17 degrees Fahrenheit. The heater failed to light. Needless to say, we were unprepared and had a very long and cold night. The next five nights were in the low forties, but we were able to purchase additional blankets to stay warm. The heater also supplied hot water for the van, so we had to heat water for dishes. We reported the problem and had a back-and-forth conversation via text messages that didn’t solve the problem. The next suggestion was to contact a repair person. We contacted the repair person. We found out that he could only give us a 3-to-4-hour window when he would show up, which would have cut into our vacation time. In addition to the waiting time, we would have had to pay the repair person a $300 fee. Indie Campers said they would have reimbursed the fee. At this point I didn’t have much faith in Indie Campers. In addition, to the heater not working the following other items were also a problem: overhead compartment hinge was held in place by 1 screw; All of the laminate on the counters, selves and shower door was peeling; The vents in the overhead compartment were held together by duct tape; The head rest on one of the back seats was broken, which made it uncomfortable to sit; When emptying the gray water the hose connection fell off the van making a mess; while trying to fix the heater, I found dirty socks in the seat; The provided kitchen set was so dirty that we had to wash it before using it.
For reimbursement for our troubles, I asked Indie to waive the additional mileage fee, the early check out fee and the late check in fee. We returned the van early, so the late check in fee wasn’t applicable. The total of the requests would have been approximately $500 for a rental that was over $2500. The local shop issued the mileage credit. Indie vans offered us $165 credit. That was the end of the conversation from them. We had planned to use Indie Van for a trip to Iceland. We cancel that rental, which would have been several thousand dollars of additional revenue for Indie Vans.",1

We thought it would become clear at the airport, but not at all. They could have told us it was a bus or expensive taxi journey. After finally getting there we had to wait for around an hour due to understaffing in the makeshift depot. Finally we got to see our campervan, and couln't believe that they could even offer it to someone since the interior was so old, worn and the seats torn up. They had no other vehicles to give us, and the only thing we could do was to spend a couple of hours on the phone to the useless helpline (sounded like it was in India) which did nothing to help and costed masses of money. Finally we got an email suggesting we could go and get the seats fixed and offering to help find somewhere to do it. That was of course not what we wanted to spend our holiday doing! They said we could not get a refund if we did not take the vehicle, so we had no choice but to take it, after many wasted hours. Within a few minutes of setting off a cupboard door fell off, and during our 10 day trip we discovered more and more things that were either broken or broke with the lightest touch. We had to buy strong tape and fix everything in order to be able to use it, including a bed frame that was missing slats and coming apart, blinds, seats and the key. The leaking water tank wasn't possible to fix, so we could not use the toilet or shower or have water for cooking. Luckily the engine worked and we managed to have our holiday, but all the stress and inconvenience caused is something that should be compensated. However Indie Campers do not answer emails and the chat on whatsapp that they tell you to use only works until they do not like what you are saying and do not answer anymore. Saying sorry for things does not fix them. This company is a complete nightmare and should not be allowed to operate!",1
Terrible Experience – Booking Cancelled Without Notice and Zero Accountability,"Terrible Experience – Booking Cancelled Without Notice and Zero Accountability

I had a relocation booking with Indie Campers (via Imoova), and on the day of pickup, I arrived at the agreed location—only to be told there was no vehicle available. I spent over three hours trying to get answers from support, only to find out the booking had been cancelled the day before without any notification.

To make it worse, Indie Campers initially blamed Imoova, claiming they were responsible for the cancellation. But after looking into it and speaking with both sides, it became clear: the fault was entirely with Indie Campers. They had rented the van to someone else and failed to inform anyone or update the system, which still showed the booking as confirmed.

This careless handling of the situation ruined my entire trip. I had accommodation and travel plans built around this booking, all of which had to be cancelled last minute—at my expense. A simple refund doesn’t begin to cover the time lost, costs incurred, or stress caused.

I strongly advise against trusting Indie Campers. Their lack of communication, professionalism, and willingness to take responsibility is shocking. If you value your time and peace of mind, look elsewhere.",1
Avoid Indie Campers Las Vegas,"Terrible experience. 4-hour pickup delay with no notice. Van was missing bedding, had one knife, a broken table, no dump hose, and no BBQ (which we paid for). Water and black tank connections were damaged—we had to drive to a repair shop ourselves. Support was useless, only via WhatsApp, and falsely accused us of off-road driving. We’ve submitted complaints, but so far, no response. Completely unprofessional. Avoid at all costs.",1

Please please avoid this company,"I would strongly recommend that you avoid this company at all costs. We booked a pickup from Amsterdam, we paid for a out of hours pickup (8.30pm) which was 1.5hrs after our flight arrived which i'd hoped was enough. Our flight was delayed by 30mins and when we arrived in Schiphol airport, passport control was taking 40mins meaning it would be 9.00pm before we could pick up the camper. As soon as i arrived in Schiphol I contacted customer support and after waiting 24 mins for a response, they told me they had escalated the issue and closed the chat support. At 8.59 when we were in the taxi on the way from the airport, I received an email saying that as we hadn't collected our vehicle we would be charged a late collection fee and the depot was closed. I immediately contacted support again as we were 5 mins away - I never received a response. When we arrived the depot was closed but there was a telephone number which our taxi driver kindly rang due to language issues. To cut a long and convoluted story short, we had to pay the depot staff an additional €100 on top of the late collection fee already paid to get the staff member to return. I fully appreciate we were 40mins late but we contacted support immediately to try to avoid any issues. When the staff member eventually returned and the additional money was paid, he was apologetic as he wasn't aware we'd contacted support (I was able to show him the email trail) and helpful but the condition of the van was substandard. It wasnt clean inside or out, the bedding and towels that we paid extra to rent were a shocking quality, the sheet provided was for a single not double, we had to hold the front blind together with tape, the bathroom door wouldn't close (a real issue when driving) and there are no words for the smell of stale urine in the bathroom. If we weren't completely reliant on the van as a means of transport, we wouldn't have taken it. Please save yourselves from the same pain and avoid.",1

Half of the things are broken. And they told us, ""Yes, we know. Take pictures of what's on your mind."" After we returned the car, they said everything was fine. After a week, we received a charge of 1,300 euros and no one explains why. There's no one to talk to. They just charge and run away.

So we booked that, continued through the process, only for after payment, seeing the dates had changed automatically on their system to 7th - 10th August. We obviously don't need the van for those dates. I screen recorded the process via my phone and it is very clear the booking system changed dates without our knowledge.
I have spent hours on to the customer service bot chat, only to be told we can have a 5% refund. Despite two things, firstly their system was at fault, and secondly, according to their terms, if you cancel between 30 and 8 days of booking you will get a 50% refund.

I come here to expose bad professionalism and,"I come here to expose the poor professionalism, lack of respect and lack of organization of this Enterprise. We contacted indie campers to purchase a campervan. After talking to the collaborator Tomás Martins and seeing some photographs we advanced with a cart that was in Porto (we were from Lisbon). The cart was in the mechanic, according to Tomás to make the replacement of the stove, the fridge and mentioned something with the belt that became very doubtful. We trusted Enterprise and proceeded with the signing of the contract and the payment of the cart without ever seeing it, only in photographs. When we wanted to raise it they said it would be between 15 to 20 business days, which they had never mentioned before the signing of the contract and the payment. We exchanged some emails and went to the facilities in Lisbon to deliver some papers (which apparently were missing) so that the whole process was faster. This was on the 22/7 and we had already made the transfer on the 11/7. After the exchange of emails there we were told by Tomás Martins and Inês Monteiro that we could go pick up the cart to Porto on the 27/7 and was scheduled between 9-10h. That same day we arrived in the centre of Porto for a lifting to which the collaborator João leitão (who was quite accessible) told us that he knew nothing and the cart was not clean. We asked to see the cart before cleaning and when we went looking for it, the cart wasn't even there, apparently it was still in the mechanic. It is a lack of respect on the part of the employees and the Enterprise in general when we made more than 600km in vain. We again send email with some requirements, namely that the cart be delivered practically to our door and that the indie campers make us the refund of the travel costs (gasoline and tolls).",1

when we dropped out van back we were told there was no damage to the vehicle and no additional charges but 12 days after that we had over £1000 taken off our credit card for a scuff to the wheel arch. the photo that shows the damage has the vehicle in a different position than when I returned it and there is no way to determine when the photo was taken or when the damage occurred because it wasn't raised at check in.

We also had several issues with the van, including being 2 hours late getting it because they first tried to check us in to a van with a huge crack in the windscreen that they hadn't noticed. when we did finally get a van and drove off the passenger wing mirror was so loose it moved out of position in the wind so someone had to hang out of the window and move it back before you could change lanes and eventually it fell off when we went over a bump. my husband had to buy a set of tools to fix it which we have not been reimbursed for yet.

When we got to our first campsite we noticed the van was full of ants and it hadn't been cleaned from the precious renters as they had left a lot of their stuff in the cupboards, the generator and the battery didn't work so we had no AC or fridge and later in the trip a knob for the roof vent fell off and cut my husbands head.

I am trying to get someone from Indie Campers to get back to me about a refund for the damages and to discuss all the issues we had.

do not use this company, there is no transparency with their policies and lots of hidden extras. the premium insurance was supposed to protect us from getting a large bill but it doesn't cover a large part of the vehicle so it pretty much useless.

Not to rent at Indie campers,"To flee at all costs!! Very bad experience with Indiecampers!

We rented a van for a week. When we came to collect it, we were told that the engine light was on.
We refused to take it as it is, because it seemed too dangerous and, above all, not compliant: we pay to receive a maintained and serviceable van.

No solution was offered to us in exchange, as the other vans or motorhomes were either damaged or already booked.
We therefore ask for a refund, as we cannot have the rented van or another vehicle.

The Toulouse agency manager is unable to do anything, because Indiecampers is an international agency that only communicates via chat.
We stay 4 hours in the agency trying to find a contact: it is almost impossible.
We finally decide to leave the agency, and manage to get someone via the chat, who explains that the refund is refused, because we “refused” to get a working van back.

Yes, he was driving... but with an engine light on, an inside table missing and a broken drawer!

Since then, we have been in battle with them for our money back.
We called on legal aid, which we agree with: French law requires that when renting a van, it must be delivered in good working order — without an engine light or other defect.

They are trying to swindle us.
In addition to ruining all our holidays out of unprofessionalism, they steal our money.

Not exaggerating, I can’t make this stuff up these are all of the documented problems that we had.
1. Van was dirty inside and out, still had some personal items in it from the previous renter.
2. Loose wires hanging down under van, Indie employee had to duct tape them back up prior to me leaving on my trip.
3. Roof top tent had rips in the canvas and tears in the screen windows.
4.. Zipper for side door screen door was broken.
5. Bathroom door would not close.
6. Dirty pink liquid was found under sink cabinet.
7. Over all the interior showed excessive wear.
9. Smoke Detector kept going off, but was not due to low battery.
10. Vibration at highway speeds, maybe due to tires being out of balance.

No Help Is Coming From Indie Campers…You Are On Your Own!
We had to drive over 2 hours back to Indie in Las Vegas to Switch out to another van. Second van had problems but was in better condition.
OVER ALL it was a Negative Experience and I would not recommend dealing with Indie Campers. I’m surprised that they are still in business. Lack of regular maintenance on the vehicle we had could have resulted in a serious unsafe situation while driving through the mountains.
Only positive was from employees Curtis and Tony who are super stars. I believe that they tried to help make the situation better. The manager Jennifer said that she has no power to make changes or to offer any assistance with credits towards our rental, claims we need to message Indie Campers Directly through the WhatsApp.
A branch manager who has no power to solve customer problems or complaints seems like another bad business practice.

HAVE YOU BEEN CHEATED?,"Complaint about Indie Campers?!! – Who was cheated here?

Once you get closer to the reviews of this company (which you usually don't when booking), you will eventually come across a large number of dissatisfied and - as hundreds of customers now claim - FRAUDULENT CUSTOMERS. And these customers apparently all have the same concern: You feel “cheated” by the company Indie-Campers! – What kind of crook is this? Let’s look into it ...and get our money back?!

I, too, have had corresponding experiences
[and if a lawyer of the company wants to delete this post: these facts (claims) can all be substantiated and proven by documents].

In July 2025 I booked a camper there. And then the theater started:
To date, I have not received a confirmation, nor can the company be reached by phone. – Read what customers complain about in rows on the Internet: THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER (or only with a long delay!) after transferring your money, but also on the road when you have a breakdown. ACCESSIBLE AND THE MONEY IS GONE!!
Customers who break down with their carts, some of which are in poor condition, on the road and then do not get help [All readable in the reviews on the Internet.]

I, too, have not received any response to my many requests via different communication channels and with the request for feedback or refund. ES is simply not responding. THE COMPANY INDIE-CAMPERS simply evades its responsibility and DIVES. – I guess: the money is collected, the money is gone, and the service is not provided.

But also the booking process needs extreme caution!!! – I have booked and before I could confirm the payment, the booking process was aborted. Then I booked again, and then afterwards found that there were two debits. So I paid twice for the booking, but now I have no way to get a refund. What do you call it? Rip-off? Cheating?

In the meantime, I have written to the owner, Hugo Oliveira, in Portugal, but I have not received a reply from there either.

Warning:
This company pretends to be a car rental company (similar to Avis, Europcar, Hertz or Sixt), takes the booking and payment, so collects the money from the customer ... and then disappears. Anyone who bothers to read the terms and conditions will find confirmation: Money gone, company evades responsibility and is not available. And on top of that, there is no immediate booking confirmation.

On the internet I came across a petition that apparently about 350 defrauded customers have already signed. – Take a look at “Stop the Indie campers company scams”.

Well, if hundreds of customers are bothering to start a petition, then there must be a bigger scam behind it, isn't there!? Well, JA apparently I was wonderfully ripped off and cheated.

But giving up is not an option! This is going to be a hot fight now... because I'm not willing to just put up with it. If you want to join me, please contact Telegram or Doc Wolf on WhatsApp under DocWolfR

What opportunities do I/we have? – We will see. DA comes to me every day with new ideas and I am sure to find a way to stop this company (public prosecutor, tax authorities, EU authorities, unmasking PayPal and other payment services, Wikipedia and last but not least a flood of reviews on the internet). For the sake of European consumer ES, it seems to me urgent that such firms should be closed by the authorities and that money intermediaries should exclude them from payment transactions. Otherwise, the hard-earned holiday pay is gone from many others ... and those already injured remain sitting on their disappointment. Whether I/we can achieve this and get compensation for our damage from the bankruptcy estate of the company Indie-Campers will be seen. But I'm hopeful.

So if you are a victim yourself and want to join my initiative, please contact us.",1

There has been no clear explanation or justification provided, and any attempts to get clarity have been met with vague responses or complete silence. They have not been able to clearly identify any issue on their end that would warrant withholding the deposit.

Do not hire from indie Campers!,"DO NOT HIRE FROM INDIE CAMPERS! The whole company is a con and a money grab!

Me and my partner hired a vehicle which subsequently had a non functioning fuel gage followed by a continuous fuel leak. On trip support wanted us to pay to get this fixed, even though we paid for premium insurance and roadside assistance. They then suggested we drive the vehicle, where I highlighted this is unsafe to myself, other road users and drivers, due to fire risk, and for a company to reccomend driving an unsafe vehicle is crazy! After 22 hours they finally organised a tow truck, however the tow only removed the vehicle and wasnt organised to drop us off anywhere so we where left us on the side of the road, in the rain with all of our belongings. We then had to pay out of pocket for the trains and ubers to get to the closest Indie Camper Depot as on trip support claimed they could not assist us to get there.
We eventually got a replacement van, and within 24 hours noticed that the battery on this van was not effective, and the control panel could not accurately show the level of battery left. Five days later, the water pump in our van, which powers the taps and shower broke meaning we could no longer use these products within the van. After contacting customer support we were told that although we had paid for roadside assistance, and were located in a major city with multiple connections at the time, they could not provide this to us, and we would need to pay for the repairs ourselves! They claim they will reimburse you for these things within 5 days, yet we are yet to be reimbursed for the costs of the original break down and thus were unwilling to pay for repairs on this empty promise. On trip support did not then come back with other options to assist us, even thought we again had premium insurance to cover breakages within the van!

We asked if they had other smaller vehicles, but they didn’t. Their solution was that we pick up a vehicle 400 miles away in the opposite direction of our destination. When we said we had reservations for backpacking trails that we could not reschedule, they said they couldn’t help us further.

They have refused to give a refund despite our calls. The call center is a third party and has no ability to issue refunds. All other communications are via email where we get stock responses reiterating that per our reservation a refund is not possible because an upgrade was offered.

DO NOT USE INDIE CAMPERS! Read all of their negative reviews on Reddit, Google and Trip Advisor first. I wish I would have.

ATTENTION TO YOUR CREDIT CARD,"I rented a camper back in 2023, I avoid telling what happened to me, but I would like to let you know that after 2 years I received a charge tonight at 4.25 on my credit card of € 25.00.
They can even clone your credit card.
Unable to contact where I rented the camper number permanently occupied. I can't find any numbers or emails to contact.
I'll be forced to block the card.
SHAMEFUL",1
Don't book with this company,"Customer support is genuinely horrific. Like, absolutely non existent. I left my purse in a van and thankfully realised while within a 30min taxi ride to the depot. While on the way back, I contacted customer support and asked for the depots phone number so I could contact them and ask them to keep the purse safe. Indie campers didn't respond for 7 hours and when they finally did they told me that they ""couldn't share that information"". I was gobsmacked. Apparently my only option was to accept that my purse (with ID, credit and debit cards inside) was gone forever. Thankfully we were near to the depot and could return and get it without any issues. All staff in the actual depots seem friendly but the online support is actually terrifying. For a company that heavily markets its 24/7 support they are sadly lacking. My partner and i tried to use the support chat 4 times on our trip overall and we realised afterwards that we never once actually received any help or resolutions for a single query. Incredibly frustrating.",1
STAY AWAY PEOPLE!!!,"We are a small business who use to cooperate with Indie Campers. A small advice to all businesses like ours. Stay away, they won't help you if you have a problem with hirer, they won't do checks on hirer for you and won't share details about them. On the end of the hire they won't pay for the hire or they will pay some ridiculous amount like £71 for a week of hire. No chance to contact customers service! STAY AWAY PEOPLE!!!",1
,"We booked a campervan to shoot in Norway, and at the time of having to pay the balance, the site did not allow us to complete the payment.
customer service (chat with untrained operators and only front) kept making sure that they were handling it, but in parallel we received emails threatening that they would cancel the reservation and keep the deposit.
After having managed, with great difficulty, to get DA customer support to call us, and requesting to cancel the reservation and get the deposit back, they also managed to make the refund transfer to a different DA IBAN.

I can't judge the means, maybe they are well kept, but in terms of customer service I am extremely dissatisfied, and considering that I was renting a means of transport, I am happy that I was able to cancel the reservation as the risk of being left on foot without any assistance is not acceptable.",1

Do NOT use this company,"⭐ 1-Star Review: Avoid Indie Campers — Unsafe, Unhygienic, and Zero Support
I don’t usually leave reviews, but after our horrific experience with Indie Campers, I feel it’s necessary to warn others.

We rented a campervan from their Manchester location for Glastonbury 2025 and paid a premium, expecting a reliable, comfortable setup. What we got instead was a dangerously faulty, poorly maintained van and zero real-time support when things went wrong.

Key issues we encountered:

Leaking Toilet: From day one, the toilet leaked urine into the van. The bathroom seal was broken and the waste cassette was already full, which meant urine was seeping into the main living space and even toward the driver’s seat. The stench was awful and persisted for the entire trip.

Steering Issues: The vehicle constantly veered to the right and felt unstable at speed. Driving was stressful and dangerous.

Fridge/Freezer Failure: The fridge/freezer turned off randomly, spoiling all the groceries we’d brought for the week. We spent hundreds of pounds replacing food.

Interior Door Wouldn’t Lock: We were unable to lock the campervan from the inside. At a crowded festival with known theft problems, this was a major safety concern.

Broken Control Panel: The electric panel didn’t work, so we had no idea how much water or gas we had. We had to guess everything.

Cigarette Smoke Smell: The interior reeked of old smoke. As non-smokers, this was unpleasant and made sleeping in the van very uncomfortable.

Dashboard Damage: The dashboard was cracked and made the entire vehicle feel neglected and uncared for.

Non-UK Plug Sockets: The van had European outlets despite being rented in the UK. No adapters were included or even mentioned.

Missing Levelling Blocks: Without these, the van was on a tilt the whole trip, affecting sleep and comfort.

Broken Awning: We were warned to be “careful” with the awning, but upon inspection, it was just broken and unusable.

Blinds Malfunctioning: The blinds above the rear bed didn’t stay down, popping up at night and disturbing sleep.

No Working Sat Nav or Parking Sensors: The sat nav was completely broken and no alternative was offered. The van also lacked working parking sensors, making it harder to drive safely.

Customer service was shockingly poor. When we called for help, we were directed to a clunky online chat system where responses were delayed, disconnected, or completely unhelpful. At drop-off, the staff offered no support and again sent us back to the same system.

We submitted a detailed written complaint with photos and were promised a resolution within 2 days. We have been told after 2 weeks that they will get back to us with some 'feedback'.

Do not use Indie Campers. This was not just a bad experience — it was a health hazard, a safety risk, and an expensive mistake. They should not be renting vehicles in this condition.",1
Avoid indiecamper at all costs,"Indie Camper is an absolute scam, go for literally any other company. First of all we booked an Indiecamper for the Dolomites in Italy and we were so excited. The day before they tell us our van we booked is available but a free upgrade had been offered. Except the free upgrade was a bigger, less menovourable, and poorly renevated older model than what we booked, and we couldnt do anythint about it or we wouldnt have a van for our trip. This van was particularly hard in Italy as roads are so small, hence why we booked the smaller van. Also ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is included in the van, you want sheets 80 euro, you want gas cannister, 80 euros, chairs = euros. These are basic things that should be included in a van rental but they want to bleed you dry. Also the van is very cheaply rennovated, most things are made of cheap plastic, drains are very slow to drain, stuff like that.
We also had a small incident in the van, I reversed into a tree stumped and cracked the bumper. Which wouldnt have happened in the smaller van we originally booked, ALSO no reverse censor or camera on this van. We did everything we could, gave them every single detail about the experience as soon as it happened (nearly 5 days before return). The bumper was only external plastic which could be replaced by myself within 2 hours (I dont have any mechanical experience) but they demanded at drop off that I pay 1600 euros, as that the bumper crack was identified on drop off, even the staff member at the drop off apologised prefusely for the price and said to email the company.
When I went to email them they just responded basically with suck it up, you signed the contract we can charge whatever and not show you the pricing calculator.
Go with literally any other camper, Roadsurfer looks much better",1
,Disaster. One intern handling 10 customers. Hours of waiting. Incompetent and unprofessional. Never use them. Not a serious business.,1
RUN!!! Do NOT rent from them!!,"We need a NO STAR option!
**Do NOT use Indie Campers.**
We expected a 5-star family RV trip and instead got the most stressful, expensive travel experience ever.

Here’s what we faced:

* Our first RV broke down—window snapped mid-drive in 113° heat, and the generator kept shutting off.
* We couldn’t sleep in it for 3 of the 4 days and had to get a hotel for our kids and senior mom.
* Took 12+ hours to get a “solution”: painter’s tape over the broken window.
* Replacement RV had broken parts too—and no gas (we had to spend $100 more).

Despite everything (including $2K+ out of pocket), their “resolution” after weeks of follow-up was a $65 refund and a 5% discount for a future booking. Laughable.

On top of that:

* Both LA and Vegas pickup locations were messy and unprofessional
* Staff were in casual clothes, juggling multiple roles and looked like drug attacks that just paroled
* Vehicles weren’t clean
* Zero real support for new RV renters
* Inconsistent processes and communication between locations

Friendly staff onsite staff but can’t fix broken systems. The customer service runaround (especially via WhatsApp) was unacceptable. Don't get me started with the email chain

Final upfront cost: $4,000+ for 4 days of chaos.
Indie Campers is a joke and should be shut down in the US. Rent at your own risk.",1
Would not recommend,"When we went to pick up the van in SFO the place was a complete dump. Example: random nails all over the floor, etc. I was in shock. Then they didn't have my bedding that I paid extra for.. told me I would have to go buy some and they would refund me. They never did. In fact, they ended up charging me extra and changing my invoice without any explanation. I tried following up with them and there was no response. I've now disputed it with my cc company. Also, the van itself kept giving me urgent error issues while driving, and the company just said it was for ""unknown reasons but it was fine"". Not very reassuring to drive around the mountains with your van telling you the brakes are giving out, etc.",1
"No compensation, no accountability.","Waited 2.5+ hours for our ""early pickup"" in Keflavík – Indie Campers refused to refund the €222 fee. Paid extra for chairs, table & bedding, which were not provided. Van had check engine light on and cabinet doors falling off. No compensation, no accountability. Worst part of our Iceland trip. Avoid.",1
Never indie campers again! Very bad company,"Do yourself a favor and don't book an indie camper. Lockanhebote on the website that never stay in life in the end so. Non-transparent pricing policy, extra fees at the end of several hundred euros and in the end the more “expensive” offer from the competition would have been cheaper and you would have reasonable people towards instead of anonymous unreachable chat support staff who do not get back to you after several hours. I had got the wrong vehicle upstairs without shower and toilet which made the whole holiday more stressful and complicated",1
Horrendous experience AVOID!!,"Absolutely Awful Experience – Avoid Indie Campers at All Costs

We hired a campervan from Indie Campers for Glastonbury, expecting a bit of luxury—things like a working fridge, a shower, and the ability to charge our devices. What we got instead was a catalogue of problems that completely ruined the experience and made the price tag feel like a joke.

The van itself was riddled with issues:
• The fridge barely worked—it would randomly power off, leaving food and drinks spoiled.
• The toilet leaked inside the van, making it unhygienic and unpleasant.
• European plug sockets in a UK vehicle (picked up in the UK!), so we couldn’t even charge devices without adapters.
• No levelling blocks, no awning, and a built-in sat nav that didn’t work.
• Parking sensors were non-functional and the steering constantly pulled to the right, making driving stressful and potentially unsafe.
• The interior control panel didn’t link up with the systems, so we had no idea when things were full or empty.
• Several blinds inside the van were broken, compromising privacy and comfort.

We raised all of these issues multiple times with customer service—and received absolutely nothing in return. The only communication channel is an unresponsive online chat. No acknowledgment. No effort to fix things. No offer of a refund or compensation. The staff at both pick-up and drop-off admitted they’d only been working there for two weeks—further evidence of the high staff turnover and poor internal operations.

Indie Campers clearly don’t care about their customers once they’ve taken your money. We feel completely ripped off and let down.

We’re actively warning friends, family, and fellow travellers to stay well away from this company. No one should experience this level of service, negligence, and sheer lack of accountability.

Avoid at all costs. Indie Campers are money-grabbing cowboys.",1
Poor company.,"Avoid this company. Happy to take your money, but very poor.

Fridge freezer didn’t work. Ac worked at one level. Heating in cab didn’t work. Water heater didn’t work. Try to tell them on their site, but all indian people. AVOID!",1
ATTENTION! SCAMMERS,"A scam directly, malfunctions vehicles and invents damages later to charge you money. A disgrace",1
Society to flee,"It's a disaster. We should have read the reviews before renting from them. Like idiots we read the comments on their site when we should have read those of others.
For this price: no one comes to meet you at the airport (cost of 40 euros X 2), a camper in bad condition (no handbrake, impossibility to close the door of the camper from the outside so have to go through the front for the one who closes from the inside, very poor condition with lacerated seats, no glasses, light equipment, ...). Anyway, it's a scam for 3,000 euros for seven days. And then, a Support Service does not exist (it is an AI-managed sculpin with no way to have a human). The agency in Iceland is unreachable. 5h wait because demanded the repair of the handbrake and to be able to close the door of the camper van. In short, we had the chance to meet these worries immediately (but we were told that we had to accept because no other solution) because we are pitying those who have a problem on the way. And then, to close it all off, nothing is clear so we took two kits instead of one. No refund after 10 days ... Anyway, it's to flee.
It's a shame because Iceland by motorhome is a very good option.

Truly shocking customer service,"Truly shocking customer service and they do not care one bit. The majority (if not all) the 5star reviews are clearly fake as they come from people doing their first ever review and say very little …more than suspicious. I had the same experience as lots of the GENUINE reviewers on here.
Was told day before campervan not available anymore. Alternative was provided but was massive and too big for us to go where we intended to. Loads of stuff not working (ie fridge) and spent days trying to resolve with customer services waiting 24hrs for each response which just gave us info we had found already on Google (turn off turn on!). We’re told to go to a campsite to try plug into mains. Miles out of our way and had to pay to stay overnight (even though we had no intention of doing so) only to find we had been provided with the wrong hook up lead that does not work in Portugal. Had to drive miles again to try and find an adapter but no joy. Had to buy cool boxes and then ice every morning to keep things cool but didn’t really work. So much time lost on our break and so much extra expense. Bedding old, disgusting and completely the wrong size covers and pillowcases provided which were of no use at all and we paid extra for these. Same for the gas bottle that didn’t work.
All in all an incredibly disappointing trip ruined by the campervans issues.
Then made a complaint only to be told they’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again for next customer. Raised complaint and now I’m being completely ignored. Emailed multiple times by nothing. Tried the live chat on the website where is says the wait is 1-3 minutes but after over an hour still nothing. Tried the Facebook page and Messenger but again completely ignore you.

AVOID INDIE CAMPERS AT ALL COST.,"On the surface, our campervan from Indie Campers appeared fine at pick-up—until we opened the door and were hit by an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke. Things only went downhill from there.

Despite having a pre-booked time, we waited over an hour in the office while just two staff members scrambled to onboard everyone. Surprisingly, basic kitchen essentials like utensils, plates, and pans weren’t stocked in the vans in advance. Instead, the staff had to manually restock each one during handover, a bizarre and inefficient process that delayed everyone even further.

Our van came with a long list of issues. We were told upfront that the dashboard glass was cracked, the gas/water level sensor didn’t work, and we weren’t to use the awning. Not exactly reassuring, but unfortunately, that was just the beginning.

The vehicle had a mechanical issue—it veered to the right while driving. Once parked, we switched the fridge to gas mode and discovered it would only stay on for an hour before shutting off. This went on for six days, spoiling all our food despite our best efforts.

Worse still, the toilet leaked from the first use on day one. It wasn’t full—the seal around the compartment was clearly worn down, and waste seeped through, creating an unsanitary nightmare. You can only imagine.

The online chat support was frustrating and ineffective. We had to re-explain our problems repeatedly, with no real help or the option to speak to an actual person. By the time we returned the van and explained everything to the team at drop-off, we were simply referred back to the same broken support system. No apology, no resolution, and certainly no mention of compensation.

We left feeling completely unheard and deeply disappointed. Indie Campers failed on every level—customer service, vehicle maintenance, and accountability. Travelling in a campervan is meant to be a joyful experience. Unfortunately, this was anything but.

To top it all off, I submitted a formal complaint well over a week ago and have still heard nothing back—not even an acknowledgement. At this point, I don’t expect one.

I’ll be steering well clear of this company in the future and warning others to do the same. We've had brilliant experiences with SwiftGo in Stockport, so it’s a real shame to have such a disappointing contrast here. Indie Campers has completely failed on quality, service, and accountability.",1
"Poor communication, refused to reimburse us","Indie campers were rude, poor communication, refused to reimburse us for the tyres blowing despite the tyres being from 2012 so over 10 years old which is highly unsafe. The only way to contact them is via their online chat or WhatsApp but they take ages to reply. When your broken down on the side of an interstate road in the USA at 5pm at night its really scary to not have communication back from them. Especially when we have UK numbers so our phones wouldnt let us call USA numbers for a rescue.
The RV it self had duct tape on bits of the walls. No cover to put over the driving bit so people could see straight into the RV.
When we picked up the RV it barely had enough petrol to get us to the petrol station.
We will never hire an RV from Indie Campers again and will be advising others to stay away too.",1
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. IT IS A SCAM,"WARNING!! THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!
Their business model is based on providing insurance that does not cover any incidents, not informing you on the conditions, and then charging as much as possible to your credit card. Making ridiculous charges way above the maximum liability.
Then impossible to reach their customer support. Incredibly poor customer service.
GOOGLE INDIE CAMPERS AND YOU WILL FIND HUNDRERDS OF PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES THAT HAS BEEN VICTIMS. CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH NOT TO USE THIS COMPANY!!

Dire,"Terrifying experience with the personnel who deliver or must deliver the motorhomes, when we told the supposed manager that we had doubts about the motorhome he was going to deliver, because it was not the one we had paid for, he immediately told us that the option was to claim them for the chat and ask for the money, we told this person, who, besides speaking to us in a disrespectful way, and in an aggressive tone, even, that all we wanted was the motorhome we had paid for. He kept repeating the same thing again and again with complete contempt and even with expensive satisfaction, when we told him that he was spoiling our holidays. He had the courage to throw us out of the ship in bad ways, a little pork, that they have to pick up and deliver. In life I have encountered a person in worse attitude, unprofessionalism and less education. Conclusion: completion of consumer claims sheet. This has happened at the pick-up and drop-off ship in Dos Hermanas, Seville. Greetings to the manager, long may the work that gives attention to the citizen I do not see. My advice, don't rent in indie campers.",1
Worst customer service ever,"We were looking for a campervan rental nearby and ended up at a local branch of Indie Campers in Zemst. The people there were friendly, showed us the different models and based on that we booked a Comfort Compact online. We definitely needed this because we would travel with 2 large dogs. However, 2 weeks later we were told that this camper would not be available anyway and we got an Active Long instead. Going back to Zemst and this one seemed to be ok, was one price category less but no compensation was ever mentioned. 4 days before departure we were suddenly told that there would be another downgrade to a VW Grand California, so back to the local branch, where a friendly young man showed us the model. This would certainly be too small for 2 adults and 2 large dogs. We emailed Indie Campers for this but got no reply! On the day of departure we did not know which camper it would be!!! Eventually the Active Long turned out to be ready for us and we enjoyed a week with our dogs in beautiful Denmark. Because of our own creativity, the dogs have found a place in the camper. During our holiday we tried to contact Indie Campers regularly through the online form and through the chat and even through the email addresses we already had. NEVER did we get an answer. Today we returned the camper, the staff was already a little less helpful but I did get a phone number to which I called 3 times without being heard! Eventually I found another song and this was the first time I talked to a 'real person' about our problem. I still hope for a concession or an answer within the 48 hours as they say it everywhere. I'm curious ...",2
"Beautiful trip to Cornwall, UK","One of the worst holiday experiences of my life.

During Sept '23, we had rented a camper for 10 days to explore the southwest, with a goal of visiting highlights of Cornwall, it was my girlfriends first time in England.

The camper itself was of reasonable quality, however due to the unprofessional and exploitatve nature of Indie campers support network - I cannot in good faith recommend others use this service.

We experienced an issue with a damaged window, which indie campers support offered no help with facilitating the repair or recommendation of a repairer.

On return of the camper, we exchanged keys & looked the vehicle over with the London staff to no issue. Later that week my partners UK bank account had been emptied completely with no notice, (£600.00), and correspondence demanding a further £1416.04 at risk of legal action for ""damages"" (a missing indicator cap) caused during our possession was sent. Reminder that there was no mention of this on the handover inspection.

The emotional stress that this has caused myself and my partner is indescribable, and has put great financial burden on myself in tandem with the horrifying experience of being in a new country with now an empty account, and a further unexpected cost incurred of £1416.04.

Indie campers have not been able to produce any evidence that this £2,016.04 is the true cost incurred. And have not provided any support in the discussion.

I would give 0 stars if I could and will never personally use this service again. Due to the unprofessional and aggressive conduct of the support team, nor will I ever recommend Indie Campers as a provider for a short term lease in any circumstance.

Buyer beware.",2

Very bad experience with Indie Campers – Neglected Safety and Non-existent Service,"Very bad experience with Indie Campers – Neglected Safety and Non-existent Service

We rented a van from Indie Campers and after only a few kilometres we found that the two front tires were completely smooth, to the point that the rope was visible – a totally dangerous and unacceptable condition for a rental vehicle.

Unfortunately, we didn’t check them at first, relying on the check carried out by Indie Campers (who takes about twenty photos of the vehicle, but never checks the condition of the tires, which is an essential safety element).

Following our Customer Service call, we had to have the tires changed urgently in an approved garage. Since then? Radio silence. We’ve been trying to get reimbursement for the advanced fees for over two weeks now, but we’ve been walking Service to Service, with no concrete feedback.

In short, if all goes well, Indie Campers may seem right. But at the slightest problem, no one answers and you are left to your own devices.

I strongly advise against this company, which does not take safety or customer satisfaction seriously.

Very bad experience with Indie Campers – safety neglected and no after-sales Service

We rented a van from Indie Campers and, after just a few kilometers, discovered that both front tires were completely bald, to the point where the inner cords were visible – a dangerously unsafe condition for any rental vehicle.

Unfortunately, we didn’t check the tires before departure, trusting the company’s inspection process. They take around twenty photos before you leave, but fail to check the most critical safety elements – like the tires.

After Contacting Customer Service, we were instructed to replace the tires urgently at an approved garage, which we did. Since then? Nothing. It’s now been over two weeks, and despite multiple follow-ups, we’re still waiting for a refund. We're just being passed around with no resolution.

In short: Indie Campers may seem fine if everything goes smoothly. But as soon as something goes wrong, no one is there to help.

I strongly advise against using this company – they show no real concern for safety or customer support.",1
INDIECAMPERS ARE SCAMMERS -Customer Service is appalling!!!,I have a booking to go away with Indie Campers this summer August 15th till 29th August. I made an adjustment to my booking about a week ago. Arranging a different pick up and drop of f point. this took nearly 7hrs to do because Indiecampers only have chatbot system. Now several days later and I have clicked through my booking and the booking has disappeared altogether. despite over 10 attempts with the chat bot. I have no idea if the booking still exists or not. Indiecampers have over £1000 of my money! I am so angry and so frustrated.,1
Find a different company,"Vehicle was poorly maintained and in need of a deep clean - floors in particular were gross and the mattresses.
All the window struts were broke, shelves broken, seat covers torn, key lock for door not working ( so had to always go in via front door), the sound system didnt work etc etc when we opened the top skylight it was not on its hinge so it just fell off. We had to spend our time repairing it before we could continue with our trip,
We were 5 people in the atlas 5 and they only provided for of each utensil ( cups, cutlery , cups) and 4 chairs for outside table.

We paid an a ridiculous amount for bedding which was torn, stained and very old. Open and check before you leave the depot.
They did refund us for this in the end, but we were not compensated and were disappointed with the response in regards to all the other issues we had with the vehicle.
During our 9 day rental we contacted them via whatsapp but nothing was resolved. I would hate to have a serious issue during the trip I feel they would not resolve it quickly.

Depot staff were hit and miss with customer service skills.
We waited over and hour to do the final drop off of the camper - which only took 5 minutes. Not sure why they left us waiting so long.

Would not recommend Indie Campers",2

Their booking and insurance is a scam. Just stay away and book your rv somewhere else. Unless you want to see your vacation ruined",1
Potential to be great if not shadowed by forced disaster,"So truthfully was at a 3 star till the end of the trip. First the good. The 2 teenage workers at the salt lake location go above and beyond. They are understaffed and do not have the resources they need, however they went as far as to give me their personal phone number so I could have my questions answered 24/7. overall the RV did serve its purpose. It got us to our location and my family overall had a decent time. Lastly the tankless water heater was HEAVEN. Honestly probably made my wife forget about anything disagreeable with the rest. Now for the bad. small things initially, things not discussed on pickup, it was out of washer fluid, was dirty in places and we had to do a nitty gritty cleaning, again small things and easily forgivable. things went bad when I tried to use the sewage pipe. the pipe that is supplied is probably from the 70's. I think you have to go out of your way to find a pipe this bad. it is very short and leaks. it also has such a weak latching system. This was my first rv trip. had I known I would have bought a new one before we left. once out there I got covering in grey and... yes DARK water because of this pipe jumping off randomly. This is a horrible thing for anybody new to the RV experience. still not great but forgivable. Now for the worst. When you first pick up you are given a 24 hour roadside support number. they tell you to text not call. well on the way home we got a flat tire on one of the dually tires. I texted the support and got no response. after searching I found a support number and called that. they said they would try to find somebody and would call me back in twenty minutes. 1 hour h=goes by and no response. we call back and are told they do not have a ticket. they try to start another claim, regardless no help. What makes this situation unforgivable is that the vehicle is equipped with a spare tire, but NO jack or TOOLS! the pickup center confirmed this is because of liability. That being said we eventually drove home at low speed on a bad tire which added 4 hours to an already 13 hour journey home. 2 hours into that drive the support called us back to tell us there is no update on the status of our support request. Had a front tire blown out I am convinced we would still be stuck out by the freeway. If you use this make sure you have alternate plans for roadside support as theirs is a placebo.",1
Malísimo. Estafadores,"Indi Campers ruined my holiday!
I rented a caravan from Indi Campers in june, and the battery that powers the lights and water did not work since day one. I contacted your support (only a chatbot!), and all I got were vague answers and no real help. We had to live like that for 7 full days!

I had to drive to a workshop — and was told it could only be fixed if I left the van for 2 full days. How is that acceptable on a trip I’d been planning for months?

This is not the experience I paid for. Indi Campers, take responsibility and fix this now! You’ve ruined my vacation.

WARNING OF INDI CAMPERS!!!,"Warning to use Indy Cars!!!!
We won’t do it never ever again!
The pic up station Paris Charles de Gaulle (20 Min away from airport) we had to wait 3 h to have our motorhome. You have to know this is a huge old factory barn with a dusty, dirty, full of garbage, hot and equipped with two dirty sofas. Beside this the camper was in and outside dirty like a home of rats. The add blue light popped on after 15 km. The damages on the car were extrem. For example we had to fix the rear bumper with gorilla tape not to loose it! The mattress were more black than white. All curtains were out of order.
All this was toped by the way how the stuff treated us. The general manager, Mr. Dja, said“ yes you booked for 2.30. But if you can’t wait until we are ready with your camper, you can leave anytime. To our question, when he will be ready, he said : „I don’t know. Wait or leave!“
Then he left for two hours, leaving his two inexperienced and unfriendly parttime worker (unemployed as told by them selfs), alone with 4 other customers also already waiting for hours. Once he showed up again and we blamed him, how he can leave this two workers alone, he threat me to cancel our booking, without paying back anything. His shouting voice, his threats and his way to treat us is inexaptable. After 3 h finally we were going to document the condition of the camper. The unemployed man said „I give you five minutes to check the van. At 6 PM (in 5 Min.) I‘ll close the office!“ And I don’t care what you do or not. Think about it; this after we were already waiting 3 hours!!!
They absolutely declined to confirm the condition of the camper, from the point of our view. The same procedure when we returned the camper. You don’t have anything in your hands in what condition you returned the car. As mantioned in many other reviews and due to the matter of fact, that the company is located in Portugal, we already consulted a lawyer in case Indi Campers will try to charge any additionals. At last we had no chance to reach out to anybody from the company either in Germany, France or Portugal. Not by phone, WhatsApp or Emails. Last has been ignored consequently without any response.
The only person at this station, who was helpful and tried to descalate
the horrible situation, was a young lady named Lydia.
Our honest recommendation is
KEEP OF HANDS FROM INDI CAMPER!!!",1
Do not recommend.,"We had a good trip at Dublin site but at pick up we’re shown a scratch on the van and we’re told it was the people before us who scratched it so we wouldn’t be charged.
On delivery back the people looked round the camper and said it was perfect everything was fine and we would be refunded.
10 days later we were contacted to say that there was a scratch on the van and they’ve taken €370 from our credit card!!
When trying to get hold of them though instant chat it took 10 hours for them to respond. Through email it was about a week for them to get back!
Photos have no number plate shown or date and time so we do not trust them.",2
THE WORST EXPERIENCE,"¡¡Don’t rent any van from Indie Campers!! They’ll ruin your trip for sure.

When we picked up the van at the Venice depot, we had to come back after driving just a few kilometers because when we braked, the brakes made a metal-on-metal sound, as if they were about to break. When we returned and the guy got in with us and heard the noise, he told us it was normal — that the brakes were BRAND NEW and as we kept driving the noise would go away.

We continued our trip toward the Dolomites and the noise kept getting worse. Until we realized that something had fallen off — it was the brake disc! We found the brake disc lying on the road! (Photo attached) And to make things worse, it clearly wasn’t new like they had told us.

Luckily, we weren’t on a dangerous mountain descent at the time — but what if it had happened while going down a steep slope? We could have had an accident!

This was negligence on the part of the company. When we tried calling or writing through their famous WhatsApp chat (because that’s the only way they respond), they just ignored us. We had to explain the whole story over and over to each operator who replied… in the end, we were stranded. We managed to get them to pay for one hotel night the next day, and they didn’t even send the voucher until 10 pm… an absolute disaster!

They claim to be a great company but they’re anything but professional.",1
Almost accident by negligence agency!!,"1st day with the van:

We taked van in Venecia. The breaks makes noice and came back to the office for speak with
the agency. They said us that the breaks are news.

2nd day with the van:

The breaks felt out the van only 390 km from Venice office. Almost we had an accident for you negligence. You don’t make a revision van NEVER!!
We had to do an emergency stop.

3rd day with the van:

You didn’t give us a solution and the van was parked in the same place.

4th day with van:

It’s raining too much. The night are cold and don’t have more battery in the van. You don’t give me a solution.

Pd: 1200 euros for 390 km with the van.
Lost my time.
Lost my holidays.
Lost my money.

Very disappointed with your company.

I want the complete money back of my reservation
You can’t come back my time.

2025 year and you don’t have technical support on the road. And you don’t have a tow. It’s crazy.

I have the brakes in my hand in this moment.
We are going to Carabinieri to demand your company (the local police suggested that as well yesterday)",1
Indie campers - A disaster: NO ALQUILEIS,"A real disaster, everything wrong. They didn't replace the caravan with a worse one, and the one we rented doesn't even exist; it's a scam. Afterwards I had no charging cable or water, the doors opened while driving. A real disaster",1
"Terrible experience with Indie Campers (Seville, May 2025)","We rented a motorhome for 10 days and it was a disaster from the start. Impossible to contact the center, ineffective customer service, and no real option in Spanish. The motorhome was damaged (broken rearview mirror, door that wouldn't close, loose window, etc.), although we were told it was in perfect condition. When we discovered this, we asked for assistance: they only offered an automatic WhatsApp chat that repeated messages without a solution.

We had to change our plans, park the RV for almost the entire trip for fear of driving, and repair the rearview mirror after a crash because no one helped us. We were charged for pre-existing damage and then charged again later without justification. Furthermore, the equipment was insufficient: the camper van seats 5 and they provide 2 chairs and sheets for one bed.

After complaining, they closed the case without further ado, without apology, without compensation. Lots of marketing, zero service. We will not trust Indie Campers again.",1
Absolutely unacceptable experience – I do not recommend them to anyone,"Indie Campers demonstrated an alarming level of mismanagement, disorganization, bad faith, and total disrespect for the customer.
It started with an unilateral change to the reserved vehicle: I paid extra for a campervan with an interior WC and shower, and just two days before the trip they assigned me, without any notice or permission, a van with none of those features. I spent an entire day on calls to resolve the obvious – that I would not accept an inferior vehicle and that it was their responsibility to ensure the advertised fleet was actually available. Customer service was appalling at every stage: they only answered in English, ignoring local customers, their phone number is deliberately hidden on their website to make contact difficult, staff had zero technical knowledge about the vehicles and could not answer questions, when they finally acknowledged the mistake, they said they could only deliver an equivalent van one day after the original reservation, forcing us to delay our trip and completely ruining our holiday plan. Even then, they initially refused to refund the lost night, requiring yet another heated discussion just to get that resolved.
One hour before pickup, another surprise: the vehicle they promised had “a problem” and was no longer available. They guaranteed another supposedly equivalent van – but offered no proper instructions for someone renting a campervan for the first time. And worse still: at collection, the van was poorly prepared and unsafe: The grey water tank was half full, the fresh water tank was nowhere near 100%, the gas bottle valve was jammed, and couldn’t be turned as the staff had shown us, making it impossible to shut off properly and creating a serious safety risk for anyone driving. When I noticed this, I tried calling – they told me technical issues during the trip had to be handled via WhatsApp, where they never replied. We tried to fix it with help from other experienced campers, without success. I wrote emails – they took more than two days to respond, with no practical solution other than telling us to go “sort it out” ourselves at a shop. At the return, more proof of bad faith: during the post-rental inspection they confirmed the van was in perfect condition. They guaranteed the security deposit would be released within six business days because it was already “cancelled”. In reality, it took 20 business days, only after repeated email complaints. To top it off, one month after the rental, without any prior contact or authorization, they charged my card the full excess amount (€199) from the premium insurance, claiming they found “a scratch” on the van. At the moment of inspection, they confirmed there was no damage at all. Yet a month later, they conveniently found a scratch and decided to bill me for it, hiding behind a contract full of small print that gives them 30 days to “detect” and charge for damages.
This is blatantly abusive and unacceptable. They used my payment details unilaterally, without consent, to charge for damage that did not exist at return and which conveniently appeared a month later. Their only response was: “it’s in the contract and you accepted it.” That is the level of seriousness and customer care they offer: none. Conclusion: Disorganized company, abysmal customer service – before, during, and after the rental, no technical preparation for the service they sell, serious safety issues due to poor vehicle preparation, clear bad faith and abuse in handling payments and post-rental charges. I do not recommend Indie Campers to anyone. There are many other companies in the market that offer this service with professionalism, seriousness, and transparency – qualities that Indie Campers, unfortunately, completely lacks. If you value your money, time, peace of mind, and safety, choose another company. Avoid this nightmare.",1
DO NOT RENT INDIE CAMPERS,"DO NOT RENT FROM INDIE CAMPERS.
One of the worst experiences of my life — and my parents' — on an RV camper in Portugal.

As soon as we left the RV depot, we began noticing numerous broken items in the campervan, such as shades not staying closed and cabinets coming open. We started making a list and ended up with 28 separate issues, including problems with the vehicle's driving performance. Eventually, the vehicle stranded us at the RV campsite park and never ran again.

This experience was full of problems and issues with the camper. First, we had to jump-start the battery. As we continued our journey, engine lights would come on and off. Then, on our second-to-last day, the battery completely died, and the camper would not start again.

And yes — we had paid for premium insurance, which supposedly included roadside assistance. However, when we contacted Indie Campers — the only option being a WhatsApp messaging-only number — we were told to jump-start the van ourselves.

We managed to jump it, but it barely turned over. We eventually got it running and drove toward a campsite, but it died again — this time, we had to push it into the site.

That evening, we contacted Indie Campers again via WhatsApp and were sent in circles. Despite sending our location and a video, as requested, they refused to send a tow truck or offer any real assistance.

We tried everything:

Contacted Indie Campers multiple times on various numbers found on the internet — NONE worked

WhatsApped at various hours, chatted with bots and maybe real people

Called the US Embassy

Reached out to their insurance provider in Sweden

Even contacted the local Portuguese police

This was a truly awful experience, and hopefully never to be repeated.
My advice: Never rent from Indie Campers.",1
🚨 Warning for travelers planning to rent a caravan with Indy campers 🚨,"I’m extremely disappointed with my experience with Indie Campers, and I feel compelled to share it so that others can be warned.

Back on June 15th, I contacted Indie Campers to request a change in my booking due to an unimaginable personal tragedy — I lost my brother’s wife during the war in Israel. As a result, traveling this summer became impossible for me, both emotionally and logistically. I reached out asking not for a refund, but simply to reschedule the trip.

I was told in writing by the Indie Campers team that I could postpone my reservation until the end of the calendar year 2025, in accordance with their policy. Based on that promise, I submitted my new travel dates: September 21st to 26th, 2025, with pick-up in Milan, Italy.

Then, after weeks of slow and inconsistent replies — during which I had to chase responses over and over — I was told that “the trip cannot be switched to another month or year” and that only minor extensions of a day or two are possible.

This is a complete contradiction of what I was told earlier.

During this time, I purchased new flight tickets and made travel arrangements based on the assumption that Indie Campers would honor their written commitment. Now, not only am I being denied the rescheduling I was promised, but I’m also being blamed for delays that were entirely caused by their own poor communication and unclear procedures.

To make matters worse, I initially tried to contact them as early as June 13th, but it was a Saturday — I observe the Sabbath and couldn’t make the call. I contacted them the very next business day, June 15th, yet they refused to acknowledge this and instead stuck rigidly to policy deadlines while disregarding my personal situation.

This isn’t just a case of bad customer service — it’s a failure of empathy, professionalism, and basic human decency. A company that claims to care about its customers should never treat people like this, especially in times of distress and crisis.

I expected flexibility, support, and integrity. Sadly, I received none of that.",1
Degrading and miserable. The worst thing I've ever experienced.,"The most degrading and miserable thing that happened to me in my entire traveling life.

I arrived with my family. Husband, 8-month-old baby, and 8-year-old daughter.

The camper was not in the requested city. We had booked 40 days in advance.

They left us on the street, and the only option offered was for my husband to take the train to Zurich for a three-hour trip to pick up the camper and then drive back alone at night.

When I arrived at the pickup location there was no sign, the keys were gone. They had him waiting at night and in the rain.

They asked him to make a deposit when, in desperation, he managed to get through after 4 hours of waiting.

I end up returning at dawn.

They never returned our deposit or all the taxi and food expenses we incurred because of this.

Sad. Degrading. A lack of respect.

I had never experienced anything like this.

I'm summarizing it because it's distressing to write it, but the details were tremendous.

(Sunday, everything closed, no food for my children, no cell phone charge, and my husband not being able to return..)

Hopefully no one. Never. Let no one put a penny into this miserable enterprise.

What they did is beyond words.",1
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"I am embarrassed to say I didn't do my homework. A combination of 'an immediate trust' in their seemingly legitimate, well designed website and a need to book something fast. Had I dug a little deeper (which I normally would) I'd have discovered the worst reviews I've ever read about a company, that is still in operation! Let me tell you they are all true.

I hired a camper van from a third party vendor, who was using their site as a marketplace to attract more custom. Thankfully Simon was great, van as advertised, communication all good. However communication with Indie, shocking to non existent. You can only get in touch via on-line chat They reply in broken English if you are lucky. You do not feel understood and nothing is resolved.

I took out the additional insurance policy which they offered me at the time of booking. Which seemed to me the responsible thing to do. It turns out this isn't valid as Simon looked into it when I unfortunately had a little prang in the vehicle. It is only valid with their own vehicles, so why was I given this as an option? I've tried to ask the question on their on-line chat but they have yet to respond, its been 2 days...

Shocking company, untrustworthy, STAY AWAY.",1
Read the 1 Star reviews before thinking of hiring.,I would advise reading the 1 start reviews. I have been charged £2500 for damages I did not do. I have been trying to dispute this for 3 weeks and have had my emails ignored. This seems to be common if you read review sites. Very poor customer service once they take your money (you have to agree to them being able to just take money from you card for damages - there is no discussion)! I have provide video evidence to them and haven't had a satisfactory response..,1
Bad experience,"Bad shopping experience. The vehicle was delivered with 50000km more than those declared, with documents referring to another plate so it was probably not even insured. Engine light on and other damage that was not there when we saw and chose it. AFTER SALES SERVICE NON-EXISTENT, they pocketed the money and hello. We will pursue legal action against this scam.",1
FUYEZ,"RUN AWAY!! I can't put 0
Arrived 30 minutes late (plane) there was no one left on site.
Picking up the van the next day The van is knocked out, indoor shower not functional, key broken. During the stay the inner battery failed putting our safety at risk (smell and gas leak) there is of course no tool and none help from Indie. and of course an ultra long customer service response time. I am still waiting for the refund. A fee has been added to the delivery of the van still no answers.
Too bad because the country is very beautiful but the experiment is missed.
BIG DUMB!! TO FLEE",1
Dangerous black mould in sleeping area! Zero compensation or accountability,"Our early June rental from Venice turned into a stressful mess. After driving to the Dolomites, we opened the pop-up roof and found serious black mould in the sleeping area (with photos to prove it). We slept downstairs the first night, then drove 5 hours round-trip to Venice expecting a replacement van. Instead, they just “cleaned” the mould and gave us the same van back, still full of fumes.

We lost a full day of our trip, plus money on fuel and tolls. Customer service from the Venice/Italy team was chaotic and unhelpful — with multiple teams involved and no real-time support. Post-trip, we were told we were owed compensation — but then totally ignored despite multiple messages. We even have screenshots of this.

We were previously loyal customers. Unless they take responsibility and provide compensation, we won’t use them again — and would advise others to think carefully before subjecting themselves to the same dreadful experience!",1
"No flexibility, no refunds","I made a reservation with Indie Campers well in advance to ensure I’d get a campervan in good condition for my trip. I even added extra days at the beginning, thinking it would give me flexibility to shorten the rental if needed.

However, when the time came and I had to take a flight two days earlier than planned, I tried to reduce the booking by those two days – only to find out that Indie Campers doesn’t refund anything once you've paid. Not even for days you clearly won’t use.

This company is inflexible and unfair. They also charge for extras that seem necessary when booking, but even if you later realize you don’t need them, there’s no way to get your money back. Everything is non-refundable.

You can’t make changes to your booking without losing money, even if nothing needs to change except the dates. It’s outrageous. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I won’t book with them again and I don’t recommend them to anyone who values clear policies and fair treatment.",1
Bad assistance!!!,"We arrived at the pick up center to pick up the van, not yet ready when we arrived, they were fixing a piece of the kitchen that broke after 10 minutes.
They told us the gas cylinder was full and when we arrived in the evening, we discovered it was empty. We contacted support, which was bad in our case, to help us find a gas dealer. We drove all morning and no one had the right gas tank for our camper. Assistance was in vain.
Not to mention the cleaning and maintenance of the camper.",1
"Avoid at all costs, scamming company, criminal behavior.","AVOID AT ALL COST!

The best advice I can give you. DO NOT USE INDIECAMPERS.

They are an outright scam.

Booked a specific model 6 weeks ahead of time, showed up the day of my booking and they put me in a model that costs HALF THE PRICE. Not to mention the one they gave me had massive electrical problems throughout and WOULD NOT HOOK UP TO SHORE POWER. Ruined our trip. Stole our money. NO PHONE SUPPORT.

You can't talk to anyone in the company to get help. They offer a WhatsApp chat with an offshore indian team that will send you ChatGPT responses.

Pathetic criminal company. AVOID AVOID AVOID",1
SCAM,"They're all nice and then they put it there...
They delivered the campervan already with broken parts, we made the video to prevent scams.
Upon delivery the boy took pictures said that everything was fine and after 15 days we were told that the camper was not clean and consequently you know kept 200 euros from the deposit.
I do not recommend to anyone",1
Scammers,"Thieves !!! Don’t use Indie Campers !!!
This company changed the CV that we booked for 4 people to a smaller one that didn’t suit our needs. They do not give you option to cancel. We had to book with another company and they dont give you your money back. They force you to get something you didn’t book.
We made booking 3 months ago. Worse Customer Service ever, it takes several days for them to reply. Scammers!!!",1
Very poor experience Ireland location,"Very poor experience at the Ireland Dublin location. There is no local support available - only support available is an online chat which is based in Portugal and takes several hours to get at best a generic reply. Our pick up time was changed the day of pick up and caused several issues which almost led to us missing one night of our three night rental. We tried contacting them for several hours to understand why it was being changed with no luck. We encountered issues with the gas one night and were up all night trying to sort it but received no responses despite 24hour support. There is a total lack of communication between the local depot staff and head office with each blaming each other for issues encountered. There were a pair of expensive shoes left in a cupboard on drop off totally our fault but we contacted them within an hour and were told nothing was found. Overall it was not a pleasant experience and would never rent from them again, all of the above issues and stresses ruined our trip.",1
Never with them again,"Two rentals and two times they do the same to us. Let’s reserve a specific camper that is what we want and assign us a different camper, much bigger and not adapted to what we need. Shame on you.

Also, this second time I have written to them several times and they have never replied, so if you have a problem do not have any support or help.

In the absence of a response, I finally cancelled the second rental despite losing 50% of it, but if I didn’t I lost 100%.

That said, I don't advise them at all. Two and no more!!!!
We rented with other companies and nothing to do with it.",1
Don’t do it! Horrible experience!,"Don’t rent here! The fact that they don’t have a phone number you can call, but only a WhatsApp number, says enough. That is unacceptable for being a car rental service. If you’re lucky, you get a decent van and won’t be needing any assistance during your trip. That wasn’t the case for us, our van broke down literally the day after we picked it up. Simply wouldn’t start anymore at all. The only ‘help’ we got from Indie Campers was to try and ask someone nearby to help jumpstart the car with cables. Which we did and this didn’t help solve the problem. Then we were suggested to tow the car to the closest mechanic, all at our own cost! After several outreaches by WhatsApp and email, we never received any help from Indie Campers or even any intention to solve the problem. We got no replacement car, so we weren’t able to even start our roadtrip. In the end we had to rent another car elsewhere to get to our destination. Now, 2 months later and we’re still waiting to get a refund of the money paid for an unusable van. Horrible horrible company! Would only recommend anyone considering to rent here to quickly let go of that idea and rent elsewhere!",1
INDIE SCAMPERS,Absolutely horrible experience. Our van was in terrible condition. And they still haven’t refunded our 500 EUR deposit. We Will never book with Them again. You shouldn’t either.,1
Indie Campers – Never again!,"The incompetence and mismanagement of Indie Campers has left me with a whole day of vacation. Compensation or the possibility of a lease extension was refused on the grounds that ‘a replacement vehicle was finally made available on the same day.’
First, we received a defective camper where the engine lamp lit up after only 10 km. The customer hotline in Portugal responded only with standardized phrases, which is why we decided to return to the depot. There, the employee told us that everything was fine, you just had to turn the engine off and on again from time to time to continue driving. He said the vehicle was still ready to go.
Despite his assessment, I refused to continue and demanded a functioning camper. An hour-long search for a viable replacement followed. All campers offered were uncleaned inside at the end of March, with unpleasant smells of unemptied toilet, food scraps and used linen. In addition, the vehicles were damaged both inside and outside.
Finally, a camper was found, the defective blinds were repaired and the interior was doused with what felt like 10 liters of cockpit cleaner to fix the dirt. In the afternoon we were finally able to repackage our things. However, the replacement vehicle had to be checked in, and Indie Campers again demanded a €2,000 deposit, which I refused. An online employee then threatened me that I would not drive anywhere without payment.
When the situation threatened to escalate, the deposit was eventually rebooked internally. We spent more than 8 hours in the depot parking lot without water, toilets or any excuse for the inconvenience. Only the next day could the ride continue under an uncomfortable feeling.
Indie Campers requests a Google rating directly when returning the vehicle. Otherwise, according to the MA, the deposit could not be refunded. As I was at that time in an ongoing complaint procedure about the denied compensation for the lost holiday day, I refused the appropriate assessment. This complaint was eventually rejected.
It was only a month later, after the deposit had still not been repaid, that I contacted Indie Campers via the hotline and threatened legal action. The deposit was finally paid before the deadline had expired.",1
HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE,"Bad overall experience.

We had many problems with customer service: the WhatsApp channel is not responding and, in case of inconvenience, you are completely alone. There was also a lack of clarity with the insurance plan: although we documented all the damage in the beginning with photos, we were ultimately charged for pre-existing damages. I do not recommend it if you are looking for a stress-free trip.",1
Lawyers,"A real scam!
We paid an extra 180 euros to pick up our van at 10pm in Oslo. There was no one left at the agency. We contacted the chat online, the person tells us that it is impossible to recover the key if there is no one, the same when we contact someone via whatsapp. We call the number displayed on the agency window, we stay on the line 20 minutes with someone who is unable to help us. At midnight, we decide to take a taxi to the hotel (which causes us significant unforeseen costs)
The next morning the person who greets us clearly tells us that it is not his problem what happened to us, and we wait another 1h, we have to fill in some papers (which we had already filled in online)
We FINALLY get back our van which is dusty, dirty, the seats are ripped (which has pierced our pants ) elements hold thanks to a piece of Scotch, the sockets do not work, the fridge is hot and we dare not open it because it reeks all over the van and even less use it, there is leftover food, and gum at the seats, we cannot close the curtain of the windshield, the key does not fit into the water tank it is therefore only closed by hand, the floor, the walls are dirty, the sockets do not work... and we are on the reserve for gasoline and Ad-blue (knowing that in the return instructions of the van, the ad blue must not be on the reserve). Once we are full we start the van and the message ""empty engine oil"" is displayed. We go back to the depot to report it to them, someone takes care of it, tells us it's OK, we finally leave!!! We're really leaving, after more than half a day lost.
3 days after the motor oil message is displayed again, very dangerous, we decide to add it ourselves at our expense.
At the end of the trip we realize that we were charged 2x the surcharge for the late pickup of the van...
We call the assistance with the professional phone of the person of the agency (yes because when you call you can not reach anyone) and the online person tells us that we will be refunded the 2x180 euros paid for the late withdrawal + taxi + hotel if we send the invoices by email.

We had only one answer in 2 weeks: we are refunded 1x180 € within 10 to 15 days. We respond by sending our RIB (otherwise how to have the money?!) And we demand a refund of BOTH late withdrawal fees.. more answers despite our reminders!
And for the oil, it is up to you, as a tenant to make the levels, at your expense, what could be more normal during his holidays and considering the rental price! Also, the battery of the van was always on the last red light = almost empty, should we also have changed the battery during our trip?
Shameful and unacceptable to pay more than 2500 euros for this wheelie bin and non-existent assistance!!!",1
❌DISASTROUS EXPERIENCE. UNLAWFUL CHARGE AND NO ASSISTANCE. MAI PIÙ!,"⚠️ STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED! CHOOSE OTHER!
I rented an RV from Indie Campers in April 2025. Everything seemed regular: return took place on May 1, check-out in adversary, damage report at € 0.00, deposit returned. BUT THEN, 31 days later I was charged € 837.24 for an alleged damage NEVER found at the time of return. I have photographic evidence that shows it was already present at check-in and had never been mentioned before!

I sent them a PEC, emails, several forms provided by themselves, used chat support but never received a satisfactory response and when requesting the booking code they disappeared! They are making it impossible to defend themselves legally and this is unacceptable and improper behaviour!

Moreover, we did not receive any assistance during the trip since hot water and gas were not working, they just ignored us!

Indie Campers has proven to be an unreliable and harmful company for consumers!",1

I'm waiting for the legal deadline to report them.
If you have already rented with them, lock the credit card to avoid surprises.",1
Only interested in money,"Amazing about @indiecampers

Please, you who are reading this: don’t even think about hiring Indie Campers under any circumstances, if you do they will steal you, lie and try to stay with you in every way imaginable.
We made the mistake of renting a vehicle from this company and it was a real nightmare: bad van, bad communication, your warehouse is a complete mess, lack of maintenance of the vehicle and money that is taken from the deposit without a valid explanation and proven with an invoice. They literally make up the amount of what they charge you at the minimum of damage.",1
Indie Campers is a well-organized scam – avoid at all costs,"Booking with Indie Campers was the worst travel decision I’ve ever made.

I booked a 4-seater van well in advance and received confirmation via email. When I arrived at the pickup location, I was told the van had been sold and was no longer available — with zero prior notice.

After almost 7 hours of waiting, confusion, and disorganization, I was finally given a replacement vehicle that was not equivalent and completely defective. The electrical system didn’t work, there was no water, and we had no way to charge our devices or use the onboard facilities. At night, the control screen kept blinking and lighting up the entire van, making it impossible to sleep. We were forced to go to bars and restaurants just to use a bathroom or charge a phone. A trip with friends turned into a complete nightmare.

Customer service? Absolutely useless. No phone number to call, and the chat service disappears when the situation gets serious. I waited nearly a month for a formal response, only to be offered a €64 refund — a ridiculous amount that doesn’t even cover the first day’s trouble.

To make things worse, I had already written a review on Trustpilot, and Indie Campers responded publicly saying they were “happy to have resolved my issues.”
Let me be absolutely clear: this is completely false. Nothing has been resolved. That response was nothing but damage control for their public image — not a real solution to a real problem.

After reading more reviews, I now realize this happens to many people. Some get lucky, but most end up dealing with last-minute vehicle changes, broken vans, and zero support.

DO NOT BOOK WITH INDIE CAMPERS. They are all branding and no substance. They don’t care about their customers, break their promises, and refuse to take responsibility.
Unless you want to ruin your holiday, stay away.",1
Horrible,"Horrible. My experience with Indie campers was terrible. I booked my van a long time in advance, in order to make sure I have it reserved. Three weeks before my trip, the company changed the van model that I booked to a different one, saying that due to logistical reasons, I cannot have this specific van for my booking. I accepted this, although the van was totally different that they offered me. Three days before my trip, they again sent me an email saying that the van will not be available on the date that I have booked, again due to logistical reasons. I tried to get in touch with the 24x7 customer support, which totally ignored me for around 20 times. I also tried to contact the company over the contact form on their webpage, which also did not get any reply. So I told them that I am not able to be there for that late pickup. On the day of the late pickup, the responsible person contacted me via phone and said that I need to pick up the van now. He didn't even know that I had to cancel this. After two weeks, finally somebody responded to one of my many emails and said that they regretted very much this situation and that they will cancel, therefore, the booking. Honestly, I would not book with them again. If there is any sort of problem, they are not helping at all, irresponsive and simply don't care.",1
Scam alert : Indie Campers,"Scam Alert: Indie Campers Rips Customers Off with Broken Vans and Zero Support

I waited over two hours just to receive a camper in poor condition: broken table, stained mattress, and a warning light the staff couldn’t even explain. They showed very little understand of how the vehicle worked and made no effort to help. One staff member, Lorenzo, even admitted that the camper was not in very good condition.

Despite all these problems, you’re forced to accept the camper or lose your entire rental fee.

On the second day, I discovered by chance that the gas cylinders connected inside the camper were not shut off properly, causing a gas leak — a potentially dangerous fire hazard. This was only found because I checked the area where the cylinders were stored.

Also on day two, the handbrake failed, and the camper was undriveable. I’ve now been stranded for nearly two days with two children – and Indie Campers has done nothing to help.

I’ve messaged them multiple times. I’ve received empty apologies, but still no action, no solution, and no sense of urgency. They are painfully slow to respond – if they respond at all.

Meanwhile, I’ve lost money on non-refundable bookings, the trip is falling apart, and I’m left dealing with the consequences.

There was no compensation whatsoever for the camper’s condition, no refund, and absolutely no responsibility taken.

A quick Google search will show you just how many issues there are with this company — don’t make the same mistake I did. Stay far away.

Thousands of negative reviews from people who have been scammed back this up.

This is a company that takes your money, delivers a broken product, and then disappears behind a chat system they barely answer.

Indie Campers should not be trusted. It feels like a scam.",1
Terrible customer service. Impossible to contact. So unprofessional,Myself and my partner used indie for our travel around Iceland in feb 25 and I could not warn you enough to stay away from this company. All was fine in picking up the camper but when our camper broke down 2 days later their roadside assistance is so terrible as it is impossible to get in contact with anyone. When we finally did they took us back to the depot and sorted us out with a replacement and while exploring in that van numerous expenses came out of my account for damages to the first van without my permission. Later after the trip had ended I have got in contact again for them to send invoices and damage reports of the vehicle for insurance purposes but they refuse to send the information I ask for that I need to claim off my insurance. If you know what’s good for you. You will stay clear of this company as it is nothing but heartache when all your after is a few details for you to get some money back off insurance,1
Never again,"Three days before the start of our reservation, I accidentally found out that our booking had been changed from an Adventure Truck (with a bed, kitchen, and toilet) to a car with a rooftop tent—which didn’t have a single thing we originally booked. The vehicle we were switched to was also significantly cheaper, but we didn’t get any refund. I tried to reach out to customer service by phone and email, but every time I got a different explanation as to why the change had been made.

Eventually, they changed our reservation again to a large RV, which we hadn’t wanted either—but since sleeping in a tent wasn’t an option for us, we had no choice but to accept it.
The customer service was absolutely useless.

The car pickup was booked for 5:30 PM. When we arrived, the branch manager informed us in a very arrogant way that they were delayed. I asked how long—maybe half an hour? He just laughed and said at least an hour and a half. In the end, we waited four hours for the vehicle! No apology, no water—nothing. They just left us sitting on the steps.

Customers who had arrived before us had already been waiting seven hours!
It was a complete mess and totally unacceptable.

But I still can’t rate the experience positively—such a delay is simply unacceptable and it totally ruined our first day.",1
My worst nightmare,"We rented a camper hoping for a comfortable and hassle-free trip, but it turned out to be a complete nightmare. From the very beginning, we had multiple issues: the generator wasn’t working, one of the windows didn’t seal properly and made an unbearable noise while driving, and the fridge door kept swinging open every time we took a turn.

Things got so bad that we had to search for public facilities just to shower or brush our teeth — completely defeating the purpose of renting a camper instead of a regular car. What was supposed to be a practical and smooth travel option ended up being stressful and uncomfortable.

To make it worse, our friends rented a separate camper from the same company and faced problems from the start as well.

Definitely not worth it. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.",1
Awful.,"IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ANSWER THE CLAIM MADE MORE THAN 10 DAYS AGO

Unfortunately, the experience was extremely disappointing, especially considering the high rental price.

⸻

1. Unjustified charging of the allowance

I was charged the full credit card allowance without vouchers or technical reports — for a slight chafing of an area of the body that was already visible and incomplete, which probably caused the damage. I consider this measure unjustified and possibly abusive.

⸻

2. Hidden defects and poor condition of the vehicle

The vehicle was not in proper rental condition. It had numerous problems that were not reported at the time of delivery:
• Cutlery drawer: loose, poorly repaired with glue and improper screws. He fell during the ride, damaging belongings.
• Pillows and sheets: inadequate. The sheets did not fit, the “pillows” were used and minimal pillows. The covers were disproportionate (approximately 90x90 cm).
• Gas cylinder: paid but not used — claim reimbursement.
• Absence of shims or wedges: this caused the camper to be tilted, which prevented the proper functioning of the refrigerator for two consecutive days.
• Broken upholstery: both in the vehicle seats and in the camping elements.
• Darkening curtains: damaged, not fulfilling their function.
• Lack of adapter for the water hose: which made it impossible to fill the tank.

⸻

These defects constitute hidden defects, not reported at the time of signing the contract, which constitutes a violation of contractual good faith and a breach of the terms of service by the company.

Run away!,I booked a camper van and paid the reservation + deposit of 2000€. After that Indie Campers asks me for a deductible between 2000 and 3500€ to be paid also before having a rental contract in hand!

Do not hire from Indie Campers!!!,"Indie Campers Las Vegas is awful to deal with and I would not reccomend hiring from them. I hired an Adventure Truck from IC Las Vegas. It turns out they dont own any Adventure Trucks so they gave us a Solis Air instead. Don't get me wrong, the Solis Air was fine - but it is much cheaper than the Adventure truck, which we specifically wanted and they have refused to refund any money. There were also items missing from our essential kit and our vehicle was 4 1/2hours late in being ready and they nearly forgot to give it to us when we arrived back at 7:30pm at their request and were about to shut the gates. It was a really unnerving experience arriving into a new country. Many other people on that same day were waiting hours for their campers or returning their campers due to faults. It seems the fleet is not maintained.
Our parents van was 3 hours late and was dirty and a lot was broken - it was really upsetting.",1
Scammers!,"🚨🚨🚨 WARNING!!! 🚨🚨🚨
This company will steal your money. Whatever you do – do NOT rent a vehicle from IndieCampers. This is an untrustworthy company that thrives by draining money from customers after the rental period. It’s a scam, plain and simple.

They withdrew AUD 1,409 from my account for an alleged scratch on a plastic panel. I asked for photos and documentation, but received nothing – just their useless, self-made report. Customer service is absolutely terrible – no real answers, just automated responses and people promising to help, only to disappear. No one takes responsibility.

They also took AUD 860 from my deposit without warning, explanation, or any attempt to contact me. I’ve asked multiple times what this charge is for – still no reply.

The van we rented had several issues that made the trip unnecessarily frustrating:
– The battery didn’t work, so we couldn’t use power in the van unless it was plugged in.
– Cruise control was broken.
– The oil warning light was on constantly. When we reported it, they told us it was “normal” and we could top up the oil ourselves.
– One cabinet door was missing, and another was broken.
– The grey water sensor was faulty. They even told us we could just dump wastewater directly on the ground – which is illegal in Australia and could have resulted in a fine.

It feels both humiliating and deeply frustrating to be scammed like this – especially when you’re just trying to enjoy a vacation you’ve worked hard for. I’m writing this to warn others: Stay far away from IndieCampers.",1
"Excessive Charges, STAY AWAY!!","I used this company once before with no issues. I should have listened to the reviews! I was charged $2k for a TINY dent in the side panel of the van that I did not cause. I was told at drop-off that it would be a $400 charge, which I thought was still excessive. Then I was charged $2000 days later! The pick-up and drop-off experience should also have been a red flag. The pick-up/drop-off location was sketchy, unclean, unorganized, and we were ignored for 20 minutes (workers walking past us and ignoring hellos) both times before anyone greeted us. The functions of the van were explained to us in a very rushed and unhelpful way. We also realized when we went to empty our gray water that the valve outside the van was left open by the workers when it was given to us without our knowledge. While many of these things are something I'd be willing to overlook, the excessive charges (that so many other users warn you about!) make everything else feel like red flags for an overall sketchy company. I will not be using them again and recommend you look elsewhere.",1
"Paid for an RV, Offered a Van, totally unacceptable","I booked an RV. After they wrongfully canceled it, they offered to "" reactivate"" it but for a VAN, not the RV I paid for. that's like booking a hotel suite and being given a bunk bed in a hostel. this company is dishonest and shady.",1
"Disappointing experience – no goodwill, poor support","Due to numerous negative reviews and my own experience with poor customer support, I cancelled my trip at Indiecampers. There is no statutory right of withdrawal or revocation at Indiecampers – and unfortunately no goodwill solution is offered.

Communication is limited exclusively to WhatsApp, which makes the exchange even more difficult. Despite repeated requests for a partial refund, this was categorically rejected. There is also no discussion of factual arguments.

I am aware that you should familiarize yourself with terms and conditions and cancellation conditions in advance. Nevertheless, I would have expected a minimum of customer focus – especially as the approach is very strict and inflexible.

My advice: Read the reviews of other customers carefully and check the terms and conditions carefully. Anyone hoping for support or accommodation in case of changes or problems will unfortunately be disappointed at Indiecampers. There are significantly more customer-friendly providers on the market with transparent and fair conditions.",1
"Indie campers , not a responsible and honest company!","Skip indie campers! Our camper van had faulty awning, choked pipes, and no gray water outlet! No useful help for 1 week and we had to shower and do dishes at common facilities while being charged for these facilities. We had to troubleshoot and bought a pail to hold the grey water, then was advised by the company to pour chemical agent to clear the choked pipes and when that didn’t work, we had to get a plunger to clear the over flowing pipes ! They offered a 5% discount for all the inconvenience and headaches. We have saved two years for this trip, so it was a huge disappointment.",1
Van not available when arrived in Australia,"We had hired a campervan from Indie in Darwin Australia. When we arrived ( the day before we were due to pick it up for 6 nights) we had an email telling us there was no van available the next day and it would not be ready for 2 further days.
We were unable to contact the company and they did not reply to emails for 12 hours each time. There was no phone number.
We discovered that they were running Australia from Portugal so they were not working while we were awake.
Eventually they agreed to put us up in a hotel for 2 nights but this turned
out to be a hostel with no food and us three adults had to share a very basic room!
We had to go out for every meal and had nothing to do as we had no transport. This cost a lot of money which they refused to reimburse.
We had pre booked campsites which we had paid for and could not use.
Indie Campers were very unhelpful and rude and could not care less that we had lost one third of our camper van trip which meant we could not go where we had planned as there was not enough time.
Appalling customer service.",1
NON-EXISTENT ASSISTANCE,"Non-existent assistance, following the theft of a purse containing the keys of the camper, for 6 days they teased us saying that the replacement key would arrive , in fact never arrived , we had to pay for the hotel to sleep for 6 nights , TODAY I ABANDONED THE CAMPER BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE ASSISTANCE and all our calls had to start all over again and then lose everything in nothing .

Absolutely not recommended.",1
Very poor customer service,"Dreadful customer service and really difficult to speak to a human. It took ages to get hold of anyone after failing to resolve a question on their website after booking. They seem happy to waste their customer’s time. When you do speak to them, it’s to a complete idiot who knows nothing. The van we booked wasn’t available so we were upgraded to a larger, more expensive one. All good but it was way larger and more difficult to drive. I wish I’d cancelled and rebooked elsewhere. Heating and hot water only works when it wants to. Again customer service slow. Still waiting for it to be resolved. Given a number on pick up for help but again routed to the guy that knows nothing. They seem happy to waste their customer’s time so they have less to do.
I won’t book with them again . Used McRent last year who were way better, very helpful and lovely to deal with.",2
"Unreliable, avoid","We picked up in L.A. and returned the camper in Denver. Polite, chilled staff. Several things were missing, then given to us, when we asked for them. We drove off into remote terrain. However we had not spotted that all the bedding (devets, pillows) was missing. That night we were freezing. We were told to call the L.A. office but nobody ever answered the phone number that was given to us, and nobody replied to my emails. We spent our time buying bedding - i.e. driving for a hundred fifty miles from our rural area and back. We also had problems with our toilet cassette. When we dropped the camper in Denver, polite young staff. We were fobbed off that this needed to be sorted as a bureaucratic process via email, and that we would hear from Indie Campers. We were not reimbursed. We never received replies to our query apart from the generic "" we will get back to you"" and the regular spam ads. My verdict: The camper was expensive, the service was poor. Avoid.",1
avoid them,"We rented a campervan from Indie Campers (Booking #2602891) between 28 May and 1 June 2025, and our trip was seriously disrupted by multiple technical failures and unacceptable customer service.

On the first night, the water pump failed, leaving us without access to the shower, toilet, or sink. We contacted support immediately, but it took hours to get a proper response — and we spent the rest of the trip with no running water.

Later, we faced a heating failure as well.

Most critically, the gas locker door suddenly swung open while driving through narrow Scottish roads. This was a serious safety hazard. We had to pull over urgently and tape it shut with help from passing motorcyclists.

When we returned the van, staff acknowledged the gas locker issue and told us no damage report would be filed.

Despite all of this, Indie Campers:

Ignored our formal claim for over a week

Charged us for body damage caused by their faulty locker

Charged the damage to a card not listed in the rental contract

Still has not offered any refund or compensation, even after promising to reimburse campsite fees

We have extensive evidence (videos, chat logs, emails) and will be escalating this to consumer authorities and filing for chargeback through our bank.

I’m sharing this to warn others. Indie Campers promotes “24/7 support” and “reliable vehicles,” but in our case, neither were true. Extremely disappointed.",1
Appaling Customer Services,"Appaling customer service, tried contacting them several times befofe my trip as they changed the specification of my camper van twice and wanted to know if I was eligible for some money back as the one we got wasn't what we chose.

Also after the trip we had done some damage to the vehicle (hold our hands up to that one) we were given an estimate of €4000 to repair the damages due to where some of them were.. initial deposit taken as stated in the terms and conditions and now they have also tried to charge an additional €8000 euro for damages on a separate damage report stating that the damages were not picked up on the initial inspection even though they're photographed on the initial inspection with costings alongside them. This is an ongoing case but trying to get any contact through the company is extremely difficult and has been from the start so I will be raising the issue with my bank once the pending transaction clears for them to also get involved.

Alongside all of this when presented with the van it was covered in bumps, scratches, dents and cracks done from previous incidents that would have subsequently been charged for but the repairs never carried out and the costings they put on their quotes are extremely excessive considering that they do not carry out the repairs.",1

They're crooks! Don't book with them!,"They're crooks! We have rented many times with other companies and we have never had problems, with them instead they never end.
At the time of collection of the vehicle we were deducted more than 2000 € without warning “in case we caused damage to the vehicle” disrupting the entire budget of the holiday. During our stay in Sweden we received a parking ticket that we paid correctly in the following days, after a few days from the delivery of the vehicle we are deducted the equivalent of double the fine. We write several times to receive assistance by sending the bank receipt of the transfer and no one has ever replied. After 8 days from the delivery of the vehicle they charge us almost 400 € for a small scratch that we never caused. Despite the drop off the campervan was checked and no problems were reported and our deposit was unlocked.

Total Ripp off. Sausage campervan ever,"Campervan rented for two weeks. From day 1, things went wrong. The fly windows and awnings didn't work. It was 35 degrees so we slept with everything open. We have a 6-month-old baby who was bitten by a mosquito or other animal every 5 minutes at night, just like us..of course this was accompanied by a lot of crying. Luckily I'm handy and the next day I was able to fix everything a bit. ( This is not my job I am certainly not traveling )
On day 2, the fridge broke down. We came back from a trip and came back to a fridge full of food that was getting bad. As well as the food for our baby.
The person who handed us the camper doesn't care. It's day 3 of our trip and we already don't have a fridge. Every night at restaurant costs too much money and is not possible with baby.
Our relaxing journey has been all stress so far.
Our camper trip with something more luxurious has been a hell of a journey so far.
DO NOT rent a camper from Indie campers. You're going to get ousted. The camper is a dump on wheels. The mattresses give you back pain if you are only 5min on it.

Abandoned by indie campers in the middle of nowhere,"My boyfriend and I rented a campervan through Indie Campers for a 12-day trip to Italy. We checked in last Sunday in Lisbon and on Monday evening, already in the Pyrenees, the engine started to overheat. Today is Wednesday and we have been waiting for three days for assistance from Indie Campers, which only works via WhatsApp messages. They take hours to respond and every day they say that we will only have the trailer and taxi the next day. The order of events was as follows:
Day 1 - before leaving the pick-up center I noticed that one of the tires was completely destroyed. I asked to have it replaced and was told that I had a spare tire in case that one burst and to contact roadside assistance the next day. After complaining a lot, they replaced the tire, with a different one on the other axle, which is unsafe and illegal. I left Lisbon 4 hours late having paid more than €140 for an early pick-up.
I asked them to open the bonnet because it wouldn't open. The mechanic on duty said, laughing, ""But you're a mechanic? You don't need to open the bonnet.""
Day 2 - The van overheated. The roadside assistance responded 1 hour later telling me to put more coolant in the tank (the bonnet wouldn't open). After trying a lot, I opened the bonnet and put water in because the tank was completely empty and I was in the middle of nowhere. I drove 1km and the van overheated again. I discovered that a pipe on the bottom of the engine was broken. I reported this to the roadside assistance. 3 hours later they said they would pick up the tow truck the following morning.
Day 3 - I was informed that the replacement car would be delivered at 3:30am in the opposite direction of the route I had to take. I refused and asked for another pick-up point, which I had to find myself. They accepted. At 4pm they said that it would not be possible to transport it today and that it would be done tomorrow morning. Day 4 - It's 2pm and I'm still abandoned.
We'll see what happens next. We're desperate, with a van that won't move. We paid €1,700 to make a trip that won't happen. We don't know what else to do.

False damage charges made 1 full month after drop off,"In May of this year, I rented one of the most expensive RVs from this company. The service started off poorly — they delivered the vehicle an hour and a half late because “it wasn’t ready.”

The trip went smoothly, and when I returned the vehicle, the employee who received it told me everything was fine after checking it and that I was free to go. I handed over the keys and left. Shortly after, they refunded my deposit, and I assumed everything was settled.

A FULL MONTH LATER, after I had already returned to my home country, they contacted me claiming they had found supposed damage to the vehicle and were now trying to charge me over $2,800 USD for repairs.
How is it possible that damage would appear a month later, and no one noticed it at the time of drop-off?

The company refuses to cancel the charge, even though I have a photo of the RV taken the night before it was returned, clearly showing it without any damage.

Be extremely careful with this company. If you already rented from them, make sure you document absolutely everything and don’t trust any verbal confirmations.

A completely abusive and frustrating experience.",1
Never again!,"My experience with Indie Campers was among the worst I have ever had with a rental service. Below are the main reasons why I strongly advise against this company:
1. Serious technical problems with the vehicle:
Not even a hundred kilometers after the withdrawal, a warning light came on that read ""Lower the oil level. Go to the workshop."" It was midnight and we had to stop at the first autogrill we met and spend the night there. The next morning, we contacted our trusted mechanic who advised us to find a mechanic in the area to do a check explaining that some of the oil was definitely to be removed to avoid damaging the engine in the long run (problem that can happen with diesel engines - I will not dwell further). Embittered but with no other choice, on Saturday morning (Holy Saturday), when we woke up, we looked for a local mechanic and went to his workshop. The mechanic made all the necessary checks and, listen listen, told us that indeed part of the oil was to be removed practically repeating the exact same words of our trusted mechanic. This detour obviously cost us both money and precious time. Despite sending Indie Campers an itemised invoice for the mechanic at the end of the rental, Indie Campers still maintains that it was probably a faulty sensor! Almost implicitly stating that both I and the two mechanics (who don't even know each other!) are insinuating the fake!

2. Further problems with the vehicle:
In addition to the oil, we had problems with the gas (which we solved thanks to my manual skills) and the leaking bathroom sink. All this during a traveling trip where every comfort is paramount.

3. Delay in delivery
The motorhome was delivered to us two hours late, without warning and without any form of compensation. If we had been the ones to return it late, the penalties would have been triggered without hesitation. Insomnia, double standards, double standards: when it comes to cash, Indie Campers is very quick and unyielding. But when it comes to acknowledging their mistakes or offering a refund, they become vague, evasive, and entrenched behind “internal procedures” and their Ts&Cs.

4. Unacceptable pressure on return:
At the end of the rental you can receive the ""way sheet"" only after filling out a review via a link sent by Indie Campers itself, by email, sitting immediately. A truly absurd attitude, bordering on psychological intimidation to force positive feedback.

5. Poor customer support:
The responses received to the email exchange that lasted more than a month were superficial and lacked any real will to resolve. They pretend to appreciate the feedback and then send copy and paste emails that offer no form of compensation even behind a certified problem.

In summary: Indie Campers is a company that demands punctuality and payments from customers, but that proves totally unprepared, reluctant and arrogant when it comes to taking responsibility.
The trip was compromised by avoidable technical problems, poor support and total lack of correctness. Never again.

If you want to rent a van/camper, contact a certified dealer who guarantees professionalism and assistance. It might seem SLIGHTLY more expensive but considering that with Indie Campers full insurance is not included, the gas cylinder is to be purchased separately, etc. etc.... those extra euros will make you gain health!",1
Avoid at all cost,"Van did not have toilet cassette installed so we could not use toilet in van. Support advised us to stay at campsites and purchase a cassette when we came across one and that they would reimburse us. We are still awaiting reimbursement. The staff at the pickup location also told us to keep the grey water open at all times, which is quite bad for the environment. Ad blue light came on within 2 hours of picking up. Propane tank was not totally full AND we were charged twice for it from Indie in addition to filling it ourselves. Still awaiting resolution on these issues from Indie campers. Not to mention the ma y hours we spent trying to find a place that sold the cassette and additional stops and alterations to our plan caused by the lack of a working bathroom on the van. When we finally found a place to purchase it, Indie support didn’t answer for over an hour and then told us they didn’t know the model of cassette!!!! The experience with a camper is super fun and the only reason for 2 stars. Would highly recommend using Roadsurfers instead.

Update on 9 June: we are still awaiting a reimbursement for the cassette and double charges totaling over 4000 NOK. Indie campers has completely stopped responding to us for two weeks.",1
A fraud!!!,"Bad service!
The leisure battery didn't charge so we didn't have water or light. We had q stop at campings to cook, use dishwasher etc, and of course, pay for these services.
Impossible to contact by phone. Only wsap but no one responds.
Not even the emergency phone number works. A fraud !! Avoid renting in this company!!!",1
Avoid Indie Campers if you can!,"We rented a van from Indie Campers in Edinburgh and wouldn’t do it again. We arrived at 3 PM and didn’t get the van until after 7. We were there a bit early, but still ended up waiting over 4 hours.

The staff at the depot were doing everything they could and were clearly trying their best, but they were massively understaffed and completely overwhelmed.

When we finally got the van, it didn’t feel properly cleaned – the toilet was empty but still smelled awful, like it hadn’t been properly disinfected. The handover was rushed, and it quickly became clear the van wasn’t in great shape either: The kitchen drawers didn’t close properly while driving, most blinds were broken so we had to use towels for privacy, the indicator light kept giving us a warning and kept coming up when driving.

Small things that added up and left us feeling very frustrated. We complained to Indie via WhatsApp whilst on the trip but they did very little to help and told us to try and fix the blinds ourselves.

To top it all off, we completed the van drop off, inspection and had our deposit returned. One week later we got notice that they charged us £1,400 for a small dent in the side of the van we didn’t even notice which is outrageous.

Like I said, the staff were doing their best, but the company behind it just seems to be after your money. So just be careful. Avoid Indie Campers if you can as it’s just not worth the hassle!",1
Hands off!,"Misleading information from landlords. We had to pay for services that we didn't even use. Indie Campers refuses to refund them.

I think IndieCampers is a total scam that just steals your 50% deposit and has horrible customer service.

They told us at drop off that there will be no charge and even if there was it would be less than $300. 1 ENTIRE MONTH LATER, we were charged our security deposit of $5600 and insurance and a bill for $8000. THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING to a single email or call and leaving us in the dark. This company should be put out of business ASAP.",1
Rental Gran California,Unfortunately the vehicle gave us problems with water and gas and the customer service was unable to help us.

DO NOT RENT A VAN WITH INDIE CAMPERS!,"Disastrous experience!!!

I rented a van in Faro via IndieCampers, and a week later I returned it to their local partner, Indicar. When I returned, no damage was reported to me, I did not sign any documents attesting to any damage, and everything seemed in order.
I would also like to point out that I took the formula with total premium insurance!

But a few days after my return home, I discovered several attempts to charge my credit card: one for €691, then another for €350, without any clear justification. Then I receive an email accusing me of damaging the van, followed by threats of recovery if I do not pay immediately.
Besides, I never got my deposit back for 199 euros!

I strongly contest these unjustified accusations and aggressive methods. I have never validated or been informed of any damage during the restitution. This is unacceptable, and in my view illegal.

I definitely recommend against renting a car with IndieCampers (and their partner Indicar in Faro). This experience was stressful, unfair and seems like a real scam. Too much risk. Run away from this company.
DO NOT RENT A VAN WITH INDIE CAMPERS!",1
DO NOT USE INDIE CAMPERS,"Firstly Faro pickup location is small with no parking, needed to move our car 5 times while waiting.
Ordered a specific Atlas 5 Auto as this suited our needs, but upon collection Indie Campers had changed the camper without our knowledge. When we complained they said the van we wanted was available but had not been cleaned. So we had to wait 1.5 hours while they ""cleaned"" the camper.
After 1.5 hours waiting, the camper van was supplied with the grey water tank still full and the water tank still full of stagnant water. We had ordered a gas bottle but what was supplied was not a full one as they did not have the correct gas regulator.
Freezer had no door. Part of the fridge were held together with sticky tape. Window hinges were missing or broken. Window blinds held together with more sticky tape or parts missing so blind would not stay down. Paid extra for outside chair, this was covered in mud.
Worst was that the toilet was broken forcing us to return back to Indie Campers for a repair.
We paid an additional €92 for early pick up at 10.30am - eventually left Indie Campers at 15:15 with the van in the above state except toilet working.
Local staff said contact Indie Campers after the trip to complain - he showed us on the website where to do this. He also said they get complaints daily about the camper van conditions but the company do not allow them to take them out of service to make the repairs.
The reply from Indie Campers was staggering.
They said we had not followed procedures by reporting the fault during the trip. I said this would be a waste of time as you would not send an engineer to a campsite to fix the physical problems with the van. Their reply, it is policy to use WhatsApp to report faults.
I asked for early pickup to be refunded - their reply NO as we decided not to take the van they wanted to supply - even though it did not meet our requirements
They blamed us for breaking the toilet - even though we literally collected the van, went to my house to load up (I live in the Algarve 15 minutes from Indie Campers) and tried to insert a chemical tab.
Said they are not responsible for cleaning the chairs - when we took they keys we accepted the van in that condition, and therefore entered the contract. Same applies for parts held together with sticky tape - we accepted the keys and therefore entered into a contract.

After many emails, I got €39 compensation - still to be paid.

Terrible van - i have even seen reviews where vans have broken down due to no oil in the engine - and remember you have signed the contract at that point so you are responsible.

Indie Campers tried to have my Trustpilot review taken down - Trustpilot said no, good on them.

Do not use these people. Be aware of who you are entering a contract with.",1
INDIE CAMPER SCAMMERS,"THEY'RE SCAMMERS. NEVER HIRE THIS SERVICE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ROBBED. They give you the camper in terrible condition and then they want to take care of any scratches (that I already had) To save us that disgust we hired the premium insurance to be covered 100% , so and everything, they debited me €3,000 from my account for damages that I did not do, and they also do not detail what is the amount of each damage in any case. Anyway, they take money off your face.",1
Beware!,"Terrible company -- I wish I had researched it before booking! Their ""24/7"" chat doesn't work, they don't respond to emails and their phone number leads to someone who can't hear anything on the call. Stay clear!",1
Do not rent a camper from Indie Campers,"I want to warn everyone about Indie Campers. Do not rent a camper from them!
Three weeks after the van was approved at drop-off, they suddenly charged €3,000 to my credit card, claiming I had caused damage. They sent photos, but it could have been any camper van — there’s no proof it was the same vehicle.
Besides that: I had purchased their most comprehensive insurance, with a deductible of just €200. So even if the damage had been mine, I should have been covered. At pick-up, staff clearly told me that everything was insured — only reckless driving would not be covered. Unfortunately based on that, and the all-clear at return, I didn’t take photos.
And honestly, there’s more to complain — but I’ll leave it at this for now.
Now that I am reading other reviews I found out I am not the only one who became a victim of their mal behaviour.",1
Disenchantment,"Like many opinions, mine is unfavourable.
What is described below is live. I am currently in Austria, my plan was to take the Van to Vienna and return it to Milan.
Recovery of the Van went well, the employee even spoke French which allowed me to have clear reminders of instructions.

I lost my engine at the end of the third day when the Van had run very well during the day. The light asking for Adblue came on suddenly and then the engine stopped in the middle of town. The situation was very stressful. Despite picking up Adblue from the nearby gas station I added, the engine didn’t want to know anything. (NB: I had even asked the employee again how to check the product level and she literally told me I didn’t need to worry about it). Now I think she didn’t know what she was talking about.

Fortunately, city employees helped me push and park the truck safely.
Currently, indie Campers’ 24/7 emergency services (only via chat) have still not responded to me (I contacted them more than 4 hours ago) either via WA or on their website. I am therefore in the unknown in the heart of Austria.

I am very disappointed by this lack of responsiveness and professionalism to this complicated situation that could have happened in the mountains.
I had to stay for the night at the last minute (270€).

If you are not convinced by this review, For little more:
The kitchen equipment is rudimentary, not even a pair of scissors, no bowls or cups to drink. I asked for a cleaning kit = shovel and wiper, not even a sponge and a cloth. And the sheets are stained.

Future action",1
Disappointed by the Service – Hoping for a Response,"I expected better from Indie Campers. When issues came up during my trip, the online assistance was frustratingly slow and unhelpful — responses felt automated, with little effort to actually solve the problem.

Even worse, customer service after the trip has been disappointing. It's been difficult to get clear answers or accountability. I’ve tried to raise my concerns, but so far, it feels like I’m being ignored.

I’m still hoping someone from Indie Campers will take this seriously and reach out to resolve the situation. Until then, I can’t recommend their service.

Justine Hermant JVQ96V",1
24/7 ASSISTANCE.. Are we sure?,I still have to start the journey and already I feel like giving a negative assessment. 24/7 chat (are we sure?) boasting that they have added a REAL PERSON to the conversation but then write nothing. There is no phone number to talk to someone. Double credit card charges even if the site declined the reservation. We're off to a great start.,1
€1129 trouble and nefarious customer service,"A frustrating experience with Indie Campers. We paid over €1100 for 5 days of travel and from the first moment it was a disaster.

When we arrived, they tried to give us a different camper (although bigger), which did not serve us by the route we planned. Finally, they agreed to give us the model we had originally booked, but it was broken: the water pump was not working. We agreed to take her only on condition of financial compensation, as it was late and we had no choice.

But the problems didn't end there:

The heating did not work because a window sensor detected that it was open, when it was not. We spent two days without heating, wasting time of our trip looking for solutions in blogs and videos until we managed to fix it on our own.

We were given only one gas cylinder, when there should have been two.

The swivel seat of the co-pilot, key to comfort eating, had no locking system and rotated only constantly.

During the trip the blinds went off their rail and we had to find our own life to put them back so that the light would not bother us.

The bathroom door opened itself all the way, even during driving, being a great danger.

To top it all off, many charging connectors weren't working either.
Compensation for all these failures? 25€ and refund of extras. A real mockery in front of everything we suffered and time wasted during a trip that should be to enjoy.

We feel ripped off. Indie Campers is not responsible, offers no real solutions and its customer service is practically non-existent.
We will not rent with them again and we recommend that you seek a more serious and professional company.",1
Extremely dangerous and illegal rental. No fair resolution.,"Extremely dangerous and illegal rental — avoid Indie Campers at all costs.

We rented a motorhome from Indie Campers UK in April 2025, and the experience quickly turned from disappointing to genuinely dangerous.

At pickup, we were presented with a van in shocking condition, torn seats, broken fittings, missing components, an exposed 240V exterior socket, and a filthy interior. I raised concerns, especially about what appeared to be illegal tyre tread, but was assured by staff it was just cosmetic and the van was mechanically sound. The only alternative vehicle they offered would've meant we lost a whole day of our trip, so we reluctantly took the van.

On day one, a brake fluid warning light appeared. Support told us to purchase brake fluid and top it up ourselves. We did, but two days later, while driving on steep Highland roads, the brakes failed completely.

We were stranded in a remote location, with Indie Campers’ only support channel being WhatsApp message, which took up to 3 hours per reply. Eventually, after being told to take the van to a garage it was confirmed the vehicle had serious safety defects, including illegal tyres, no functioning brakes (obviously), and more shockingly that the MOT had expired four months earlier! This meant the van hadn’t had a legal roadworthiness check in 16 months.

We were left without a working vehicle, and stranded for 12 hours. Our holiday was cut short, and we had to fight for basic assistance from their support. Eventually, we had to take a three hour taxi to stay overnight in a hotel where we had to cart all of our luggage from each place; and then drive a rental car three hours back to Edinburgh.

Back in Edinburgh, we returned to the depot, only for staff to openly admit that they don’t check MOTs or roadworthiness, only basic visual inspections. A blatant violation of UK law and a gross failure in duty of care to their customers.

Furthermore, a staff member accessed our personal data from the rental agreement and used it to locate us on social media, which we believe to be a serious breach of data protection (UK GDPR). Indie Campers has denied this, but we hold evidence to the contrary.

Indie Campers has since issued a refund (which was their legal obligation), but have refused any meaningful compensation for the risk to our lives, the emotional distress, and the severe negligence that ruined our trip. They won't even acknowledge the fact that the vehicle had no MOT and they even declined to refund the two nights of campsite bookings that we missed because of the breakdown.

We are now pursuing legal action and have reported the company to the police and Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

If you value your safety, your holiday, and your legal rights, do not book with Indie Campers, and if you do; check your vehicle at least has an MOT!",1
A scam disguised as a van rental company,"This was a scam. Period.

Indie Campers charged me over €3,000 for a supposed dent on the roof of the van — a damage I absolutely did not cause. I returned the van exactly as I received it, without a scratch. They didn’t even do the final inspection with me. They told me to just leave the keys and they’d handle it… Days later, I got an email with some photos and a ridiculous invoice.

It’s a clear scam: they don’t let you be present during the inspection, then they claim there’s damage and charge you a huge amount, knowing you can’t prove anything. And worse — they take advantage of young renters under 25, who aren’t allowed to purchase full insurance, and then trap you with charges you have no way to fight back against.

I’ve already filed a consumer protection complaint and will keep pushing this as far as I need to. If you’re reading this before renting: don’t be fooled by the trendy branding and slick website. If something goes wrong, they’ll throw you under the bus and leave you completely defenseless.",1
Appalling company - DO NOT USE,The van's toilet cassette was not empty. The deposit has not been returned due to a wholly ridiculous damage claim that is now in court. DO NOT USE!,1
BEWARE RENTING FROM HERE!! READ THE REVIEWS AND BELIEVE THEM ALL!!,"****This experience is currently active.

We reserved a couple days before the trip. I've seen Indie Campers all over the world and figured they were legit. And, of course we purchased the Premium Insurance. The night before, I read some of the reviews and became concerned. On trip day, we arrived at our designated pick-up time. Only had to wait 1 1/2 hrs. That was good compared to things I'd read. We thought we had scored as our rental was a brand new motorhome. The 30ft. Pursuit 27xps. It looked clean, but got it home and there was dust everywhere. I don't think it was ever wiped down from when they received it. There was a hefty ""prep fee"", yet clearly no prepping was done as the floors were dirty, the van dusty all over, the toilet paper dispenser hadn't even been added nor did they catch it was missing a ladder or check the heat and a/c. There were no videos up for us to watch either. I had to clear all the dust out, but we were excited.

We drove from San Francisco to Oregon. A few hrs. into our ride, we realized the A/C didn't work. A 14 hr. ride without A/C was awful. We rented the big motorhome so we could transport my disabled father. No A/C for him was not what we bargained for. As we got closer to Oregon and the sun went down, we tried the heat. We didn't have that either. That was the first of our issues. We also noticed the steering wheel seemed to have a lot of wiggle room. Getting ready for bed, my father got the big bed while my husband and I took the bunk. That's when we realized there was no ladder. No ladder meant no bunk. It gets better.

Parked in OR for 4 days. That was great minus the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. Husband on the couch and me on the table. Everything seemed to work fine. On the ride home, we were either freezing or excruciatingly hot. A few hrs. out, we noticed the brakes squeaking like crazy. This is where it starts to get really shady.

I have to return the vehicle by myself. On my way to return it, another truck comes into my lane. To avoid them, I have to move over just a bit. Turns out, this RV is literally just under the max size before it's considered an oversized vehicle. Inching over just a bit where, unfortunately, there was a pole. I'm not sure if it was the pole that took out the side mirror and awning, or wires hanging off the pole that grabbed hold of the side mirror, or if the mirror took out the awning, but damage done. I immediately pull over and attempt to contact them. That's when I realize I can't contact the location. When we rented, I specifically asked the gentleman about this texting issue I read about and he clearly said do not worry about it. All you do is ask to speak to a representative and you'll get a human. WRONG. I followed his directions precisely and the human says to contact that dept. via What's App. She states clearly: that is the ONLY way to handle issues while on the road.

WHAT'S APP? Who does this? First, understand the communication is sporadic and half-assed. I can ask a question, get a response right away then wait several hrs. for my next communication. Second, it's always a different person and they literally have no idea what they're talking about. They finally tell me to proceed to the depot for drop off. However, the RV wasn't safe to drive with one mirror and an awning half off. I waited, in the heat, for 4 hrs. until my husband finally came and drove us home. Not once did they ask if I was safe, needed a tow truck, etc. They sent me some forms to fill out for their insurance and boy, are they something. The forms are from the EUA, ask for the ""Federal Vehicle Information"" and have a section for my ""supervisor"" to fill out. I asked them for proper forms and they tell me to look in the glove box. I ask if I will find the proper forms there and no response. I go to look in the glove box when I realize there's no glove box. I completed their forms, but am still waiting to receive the proper paperwork for me to complete that will also allow me to include my insurance info. as a backup to the premium insurance I purchased.

We also can't drop the RV off unless they're open. The next morning, I called AAA to get towed. Took awhile to find a truck able to tow us, I go to What's App and ask if I should have the RV taken to the shop instead of the depot to help things along. A couple hrs. later, they give me an address for a service center, but now it's going to be closed and they can only accept during working hrs. Now, we're going into day 2 of trying to return this RV. The tow truck goes to drop the RV off and the mechanic refuses to accept it. He says he told them he won't take it. The driver's calling me for the phone number to Indie Campers, but of course, I don't have one. I gave him their address and I'm currently sitting here hoping they were able to deliver it.

I just recommend before renting from them that you know exactly what you're getting into as this mess has been the most chaotic and stressful experience with a rental company that I've ever had. I've rented all over the world, including RV's in Europe. I will never rent here again and highly suggest people think twice before doing so themselves.",1
Avoid Indie Campers at all costs!,"I rented an RV from Indie Campers in Edinburgh for a 3-night trip in the Scottish highlands. While driving, I accidentally scratched the door and sill against a concrete bollard—a minor dent which independent mechanics have quoted me to cost £525.

Unfortunately, my experience with Indie Campers quickly soured when they charged an exorbitant £2,820 for the repairs! This is almost 5 times higher than what a reputable mechanic in the area quoted!

Although we had an insurance with a maximum liability of £2,500 (basic package), almost every kind of damage is an exclusion to its coverage.

Despite my immediate objection, they proceeded to debit £2,820 directly from my account (only have a debit card) WITHOUT authorisation.

Attempts to dispute the charges have been met with vague explanations, internal (rather than independent) repair estimates, and dismissive responses. The company's damage policies proved ambiguous and unfair.

I strongly caution potential renters: Indie Campers may initially seem convenient, but if anything goes wrong, you risk significant financial stress due to grossly disproportionate and poorly justified charges. They will take the money from your account and will not give you any evidence of where the charges come from. Please use an alternative company with fair policies!! What was supposed to be a bucketlist experience turned into a financial nightmare for us.",1
False advertising,"When I made my booking, the website advertised a 20% discount with a timer indicating that the offer would expire in a day. This urgency prompted me to make the reservation. However, a week later, when I checked the van dimensions, I noticed that the price was actually lower than what I had paid, even with the 20% discount applied. I requested a refund for the difference, but Indie Campers informed me that it wasn't possible. They have dynamic pricing and can adjust their rates as they please. To me, this feels like false advertising. They should be ashamed of themselves, and I definitely do not recommend booking with them. Don't be deceived by their offers; it's all misleading.",1
ASKED FOR MONEY FOR NON-EXISTENT DAMAGES,"ZERO VOTE because the day after the return of the camper they send me an email inventing a damage of about € 100 that they would have withheld from my deposit.
Except that these reports should be made at the time of delivery in the physical presence of the customer.
But the damage they were referring to was already present at the time of withdrawal. Such a mistake, and such an attitude FOR ME IS VERY SERIOUS.",1
A criminal conspiracy .. to avoid like the plague!!,To be avoided like the plague.. a criminal conspiracy ... beware !!! they will do anything to steal your money .. our camper was infested with ants .. non-existent assistance and unspeakable means ... stay away from these villains !,1
Absolute scammers!!! Don't waste your time and money,"Absolute scamers!!!

Don't trust the company at all, they will take a huge 3000 aud bond and then will wont return it. They'll claim some damage on the vehicle which was pre-existing!

The online support is nowhere to be found, we were left days with no contact.

The vehicles which they claim are new have warning lights all over them, the battery does not last even a couple of hours, the drains stank. We even had our toilet cassette still full at pick up!!!

They're thieves!",1
Indie Campers: A complete ripoff with zero standards.,"Where do I begin? Our experience with Indie Campers was nothing short of a nightmare. What starts as a seemingly affordable rental quickly becomes a money pit, thanks to a laundry list of hidden fees — from propane to *extra charges for paper-thin bedding*, and a ridiculous cleaning policy that expects customers to return the van cleaner than they received it. Honestly, I’ve stayed in budget hostels with higher standards.

The van was disgusting on arrival. Despite a worker proudly claiming they use “AI” to assess cleanliness, I found hair in the shower plughole, dirt caked into drawers, and grime all over the floor. If that’s AI cleanliness, we’re doomed. Add to that broken fittings (a bathroom door that flung open while driving, busted blinds), and the whole thing felt thrown together with duct tape and denial.

The bedding they charged extra for? An absolute joke. Duvet was barely thicker than a napkin, and the sheets didn’t even fit the bed. Comfort clearly isn’t on their radar.

Then came the real kicker: we tried to shorten our trip, which the staff at the collection point said was possible. But online support? Rude, unhelpful, and clueless. We were told the van had already been booked to someone else (???) *before* our rental was due to end. Make that make sense. They refused a drop-off at a different location with no reason, and we received **no refund** or even basic assistance. It cost us extra money on flights and left us scrambling — all for a subpar service.

The customer service is non-existent, and the overall experience left us feeling ripped off, stressed, and disappointed. For the price they charge, you’d expect at least the basics: a clean van, functioning amenities, and someone to answer a question without attitude.

**Bottom line: Indie Campers wants hotel money for hostel quality. Save yourself the trouble and go with a company that actually values its customers.

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.",1
"Means falling apart, customer support equal to 0","We booked a van about a month and a half before the rental. Only at check-in, through a video tutorial, we were informed that the vehicle was not equipped with either inverters or solar panels. This makes it impossible to use direct current if not connected to an external source, limiting the use of electrical outlets to 12V USB only. The 220V sockets are therefore unusable, making it possible only to charge low-power devices, such as a mobile phone.

We found a clear malfunction of the battery: we were forced to stop at the campsite to make a recharge, but even without devices on, the battery discharged quickly, reaching a third of the capacity in about ten minutes. This made the water pump, interior lights and other electrical systems unusable.

We were not able to take advantage of the shower or hot water. Upon our arrival in Catania, we were informed that the van came from Naples and we were reported a fault with the stove. Alternatively, we were provided with a monoflame camping stove, which allows the preparation of only one dish at a time. A gas cylinder was also delivered, theoretically useful for heating and hot water, but also not working.

Although the vehicle is newly built, its general condition has appeared neglected. During some nights we suffered the cold because of drafts from windows that were not perfectly closeable and insufficient thermal insulation. The mosquito nets and blackout curtains were all damaged or broken, to the point that they had to be fixed manually between the doors. The interior was also dirty and worn: the table, for example, was unstable and maintained by a simple screw.

Upon arrival we shot a video to document the criticalities of the vehicle, which have progressively worsened during the journey. Furthermore, at the time of collection, the vehicle did not appear to have been properly cleaned: we found remains of food in the drawers and toilet paper behind the toilet.
Finally, although the staff at the pick-up point were available, the number provided for emergencies was inactive.

BAD EXPERIENCE!",1
Dangerously Unsafe Van & No Real Compensation — Avoid Indie Campers,"Our experience with Indie Campers in April was not just disappointing — it was dangerous. We were given a van with front tyres that were completely bald and illegal to drive on. We were told to drive over 600km across rural Australia in the rain with no assistance, no replacement vehicle, and no support for 3 days. It was reckless and unsafe.

On top of this:

The toilet was full of human waste from a previous guest, which we had to clean ourselves.

The main access door was broken and confirmed as such by their own staff.

Cruise control didn’t work (essential on a long road trip).

The advertised oven didn’t exist.

The bathroom smelled awful due to poor ventilation and a broken window.

Despite all this, Indie Campers offered a mere $90 refund — not even enough to cover one night of our $2,600 booking. Even a simple 3-day refund for the time spent on the road with unsafe tyres was refused.

We’ve now filed with WA Consumer Protection and are preparing a small claims case. AVOID this company until they take customer safety and responsibility seriously.",1
Worst experience ever,"The van was old and the main door open many times while driving, no sat nav or gps .. we had to use our phone even in remote areas of Australia to guide us.
The fridge was super dirty, the windscreen has some sort of glue that was really hard to clean
I paid full insurance with them and unfortunately I had a accident and the AC broke down .. I had to paid them 4300 dollars because of the damage when the same AC cost 1400 .. completely a rip off company will not recommend",1
Indie campers is not an option for your trip,"THEY'RE SCAMMERS.
It's been a horrible experience. First, there is NO ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. The camper had brake problems from the beginning of the trip, there is no phone to call, only a chat in which you are treated in a very bad way. We lay on the road and they haven't accepted our claim. Worst of all, after the trip they tried to REMOVE ME FROM THE CARD almost 2000€ for a small imperfect in the body that we have not made and that they argue with low quality photos.
I have seen more reviews in which they tell similar experiences.
INDIE CAMPERS IS NOT AN OPTION FOR YOUR TRIP.",1
"Horrendous company, avoid at all costs.","We picked up our campervan on Sunday 16th March 2:30pm from Auckland. A day later, upon opening the toilet to put in the first chemical tablet, we were horrified to find that it wasn’t at all clean and that there was faeces from previous users in the toilet (see for yourselves in the photo!). When we complained to customer services, they said it was our fault for not checking this during the onboarding process. We have rented ccampervans from companies in the past, and feel that to shine a torch down the toilet is above and beyond a “reasonable” check in process. We’re also shocked at the fact that the cleaning rules require someone to fully clean the cassette prior to return and so this should imply the previous users had been fined for leaving it in this state but that Indie campers staff have then failed to rectify the situation when surely there are thorough checks and processes in place for a campervan to be fit to rent out again.
The complaint was escalated but we were told repeatedly the same stance and that they would review internal processes as a result of our feedback. It was incredibly disappointing considering the expense to rent a campervan with Indie campers (we had it for 3.5 weeks!) and we would suggest to avoid the company at all costs. They care very little for their customers.
In addition to this, we were told to refill the Adblue and were shocked when this light came on 2 days into the trip! We ended up having to put a ridiculous amount in (at our own expense) making us sceptical that it had ever been filled in the first place (we emptied a full 20 litre can of adblue in to the van, and also had to put in an additional 5 litres!!). At the same time as the adblue light came on, we ran out of windscreen wiper fluid - we had to also buy this and fill this up, this is after only day 2, and once full we didn’t have to fill it up again. Finally, we had the engine oil light on and we took steps to contact the 24-hour support (who told us which oil we need to buy to refill it, when clearly this is only something a mechanic would do and not our problem to resolve!!). As we were going through Queenstown a week before our return, we decided to visit the depot to speak to someone face to face, and were told that there was nothing they could do so we’d just have to keep using the van for the following 7 days, which certainly added stress to our holiday.
Overall, one star and a terrible campervan company considering none of these issues were caused by ourselves. We would recommend to avoid at all costs.",1
Fraud!,"There you are. Months in advance a camper booked for our young family with two toddlers (twins). Just before landing we received an email that our camper was no longer available. Once they arrived at the depot they knew nothing of a bill of exchange and could not explain any compensation as we had paid more for a larger camper. Not out of luxury but simply, because the only camper was where we could fit two child seats. At the depot I was ‘allowed’ to call myself to solve it. Several call requests failed to get through. By chat I was told however I finally received a response after 4 hours if I wanted to send an email. We are now with a completely different camper where we just lost the suitcases and stroller. On explanation about the child seats I am still waiting so we went to the store to find a solution. What was supposed to start as a fun start seems to be mostly avoiding contact and answers at Indie Camper. You can figure it all out for yourself! 🤬

Worst of all, the mileage in the contract was almost 4000 miles lower than the initial reading. However, the maintenance booklet stated that the oil had to be changed every 3000 miles and that would be at a mileage of 41000 so this is not possible at all.
What a fraud. How can you live with yourself like that!?",1
THEY'RE SCAMMERS.,"POOR QUALITY VEHICLES AND NEFARIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE
We rented a camper in Milan (the very nice workers) and gave us many problems from day one.

Black smoke and a horrible smell were coming out, we tried to contact the road service and it took all afternoon to give us a solution (which was basically to take it to a mechanic and pay for it ourselves). He lost us all day and the rest of the trip kept giving us problems.

In addition, after the trip they tried to charge €2,000 more for damages that are not ours (having hired the insurance that covers everything). Good thing there wasn't any money in the checking account we gave them, if they didn't take it from you without saying anything.

After the horrific experience we searched for “scam Indie Campers” on the Internet and, surprise, we were not the only ones. They use the same modus operandi with many clients.
FULL-FLEDGED THIEVES",1
Horrible experience,"More than advice is a warning, NEVER book from Indie Campers anywhere in the world. You will have problems in every respect, from hidden costs, to changes of means and hours compared to what you have chosen, to disproportionate additional costs often associated with non-existent damage.

Hello I am Alessandro and I travel and I have been organizing trips for 20 years.
I have travelled to all continents using all kinds of services.
I've never dealt with such a poorly organized company bordering on fraud in my life.

Let's start from the beginning.
My trip included a camper to travel all over Portugal and I rely on them.
I mistakenly did not search online for the company's reputation this time and trusted it. Only later did I realize that leaving aside Trustpilot reviews are almost ambiguously positive.
Instead on any other platform you will find several reviews of terrible experiences, many even in cause.

I proceed to book the camper unaware of this. I start coldire that the discounts they propound are fake, as they never expire so what you see are real prices and nothing taken for granted.

I place the order for a new and large enough camper because I needed to travel a long way and have some security of the vehicle.

Also to stay even quieter opt for their premium insurance and essential kits and gas cylinder.

Just a few days before I leave I receive an email telling me that the motorhome I booked is not available and that I will be assigned another model that had a lower cost and had already been widely used.

I ask at least to have a refund of the price difference and am informed that it is not their policy to return the cost.

I leave and as soon as I find myself at the pick-up I am informed that there is not even that model but an even more basic one and pass me the term quite broken.
The guys at the pickup do their best but I'm not convinced. Because I see that the model I had chosen is parked in plain sight and I am told that he does not have the documents to leave.

Let's take a look at the camper and it had an unusable curtain, the convergence of the steering was terrible, which forced me throughout the journey to stand with the steering turned to go straight. The bathroom curtain was hideous and dirty plus a dissolving pill found under the bed that soiled everything.
The windows at the top were completely unscrewed and dangled if I had not fixed them, when we loaded the water filling the tank leaked and water entered the corridor, in short, also serious safety problems, in addition to the drawers that open at every bend.

I am also informed that if we were delayed a lot they could assign the camper to someone else by cancelling our booking. I also discovered by reading their absurd terms and conditions that for every half hour of delay to delivery or collection there is an extra cost of 50 euros.
We are leaving anyway because we had no alternative.
During the trip we needed assistance for quite problematic situation beyond those mentioned, the gas was exhausted and we found out only later that they send you a list but with distant points and the only solution is to return to them by charging you more for the tank than the reservation paid, I still do not understand why.
However, assistance is practically non-existent, they respond with done phrases but never give real help.

To rest assured I check what their insurance covers in their terms after hearing the deal of delays and as also communicated by the guys in the pickup, the other and lower part of the camper are not insured, as well as all the interior and even accidents. At this point, I don't know what it's for. Take a look online at what happens to some people with regard to those who have had problems with insurance, it is something chilling.

When I go to the pickup I always have the feeling that something is strange. For every question or request posed you never have exhaustive answers and always wait for confirmation from the parent company asking with their tablet making them wait long times even for nonsense.
Also the pickups are really in uncomfortable areas and seem almost abandoned.

In short, it made everything really complicated and in the end I paid 2,500 euros for a broken camper that was worth much less. If we then add those that you read online that really stay away.",1
"Avoid Indie Campers - Great Vans, Disastrous Customer Service","While the van itself was fine, Indie Campers has the worst customer service I’ve ever encountered.

Just hours before landing in Vienna, they informed us that our van was no longer available. At the depot, we were told we'd have to wait until the next day. After sending over 10 emails, we finally convinced them to book us into a hotel, only after waiting 6 hours at the depot, during which the team lead literally said, “let them go walk around somewhere.”

The next day, we showed up on time, only to be delayed another 6 hours before finally receiving a van at 5pm(with a burnt fuse, no less).

To top it all off, they refused to offer any compensation, despite it being clearly stated in their own policy.

If you never have to contact their support, you might be fine. But if you do? Prepare for 50+ emails, a wasted day, and absolutely no accountability.",2
"Horrific experience, ruined vacation","A horrible travel experience.
We booked a campervan with Indie Campers for two weeks, paying roughly the same as pay with other companies even though they initially seem cheaper.
The second battery never worked and we immediately reported it to support, which takes hours or even a whole day in our case to respond. Subsequently the first battery also died so we were stopped in a parking lot and it was on this occasion that they made us wait a whole day before responding.
After that they then wrote to us several times and guaranteed that if we advanced the repair costs, they would reimburse us the full amount so we did also because it was impossible to do otherwise, we were just stopped. A very high cost. We send the invoices and they tell us that we are not entitled to any refund.
This is highly dangerous (leaving two people with a non-working vehicle) and unprofessional.
I recommend booking with other companies. The worst holiday we've ever had, all because of these unfair attitudes towards customers.",1
TO ESCAPE to Italy,"I chose Indie Campers for the price,
I run away from them for the deplorable quality of service.

1st experience in May 2024 in Milan.
Unpleasant, rude staff, who speak Italian behind my back and make everything complicated to finally overcharge me for things I don't even understand (since I don't speak Italian and they barely make the effort to speak English).

2nd experience 1 year later in Venice.
Vehicle poorly maintained (table leg, window shutter and stove fire broken, shower vents and sinks blocked...).
At the time of return, a parking lot with vehicles parked in bulk in all directions, the container of the neighbor that blocks 80% of the passage... I park in the only accessible place. The lessor forces us to maneuver in all this disorder, with limited visibility and impossible conditions. Result: it pushes us back into the container...

Invoice: 925€ to pay for a plastic window angle and a taillight broken because of him and all this mess... (obviously, the reversing radar did not work either).

I chose Indie Campers for the price,
I understand that the instruction is to make up for it later by charging exorbitant additional fees.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt in Milan, but my experience in Venice confirms that this company is definitely not well managed and that the customer is not a priority, except when it comes to paying.

I advise you to go elsewhere, even if it means paying a little more, you will end up there avoiding all these disappointments.",1
Bad experience,"The overall rental experience was positive (Booking #2213225): comfortable, functional campervan and efficient service.
However, at the end of the trip I was charged a fee of €638 for breaking only the plastic body of the rear-view mirror, a component whose real market price is around €30-50.

I asked for an explanation but was told that this is a standard cost under the policy.
I regret, however, to see a total disproportion between the actual damage and the amount claimed, especially given that the amount almost reaches the cost of the rental itself.

I believe transparency and fairness are key to maintaining customer trust, and I sincerely hope the company can reassess its position.
I am available to review this review in case there is a gesture of common sense and fairness.",1
Indie campers is scam!,"What a awful business is this! Never hire a camper from Indie Campers!!! Indie Campers charged us for a damage that we didn't caused. When we called Indie Campers thit a question over our delayed deposit, they said the deposit was delayed because of the damage. I told them we did't caused any damage but the customer service said that we had to send an email to CE sepport. When we got the damage repport with false pictures of a random campervan, Indie Campers took €929,21 straight from our deposit on our creditcard. We don't know what we have to do now to proof they are wrong. But we can warn you guys! Do not hire a campervan from Indie Campers. Scam is their business model!",1
Avoid like plague,"Customer service is just terrible. Everytime I'd ask a question to their customer support, only more questions arise. Pick up time changed, pick up location changed, wrong cable given, no screen wash poured and on top of all of that, they promised a reimbursement for a ferry and when I asked for it, I was told no. I did eventually get a half answer to that, which was that they don't do that anymore, even though it was one of the promised benefits before my booking was placed. Surprise surprise, they are ignoring my emails now. Never again with them.",1
Very disappointing.,"Very disappointing.
Our Jeep’s rooftop tent leaked badly — soaked mattress, forced to sleep in the car. Proof and campsite receipt sent on April 11th. Only a single night’s campsite reimbursement was promised — and still nothing by April 28th. When returning the vehicle, we met other customers with the same issue. The problem was clearly known. Very disappointed.",1
Scam,"be careful it's a scam, never use indie campers!!!they gave us a non-working van, we repaired it at our own expense after their written promise of a refund, only to then say that they will not proceed with the refund",1
Worth experience ever. Unfair T&Cs,"Worst rental experience in my life… I’ve been travelling for more than 15years, always made sure my rentals were covered with some sort of insurance. My bad i didn’t read the full contract before renting with Indie. Rented an outback van (ducato 5.4m) to do a road trip from Perth to esperance in western Australia. It started on a bad taste as indie campers modified my booking 3 days before pick-up. The van was only available 24h hours later…
Finally we picked up the van at Perth depot. In the middle of nowhere. Pretty poor offices…
Pick-up was really not professional at all.
Little explanation, extra not ready (bed set, cooking set,…)
We’ve been warned that the insurance doesn’t cover the top of the van, got the keys and that’s it. I asked to add additional damages on the contract. He didn’t bother. Been told to take pictures, i’ll be fine.
Then while driving, i’ve been very unlucky, a kangaroo hoped from the side of the road, and hit the van pretty badly. Luckily no passengers were injured.
Once we found signal i reported the incident to the support chat. What a mistake!!! Just been told it’s not covered. I’m liable for all damages and I’ve to organise everything like towing back to depot (700km) and repairs.
I eventually made it back myself to the depot and wanted to discuss with the staff to organise the repair. Just been told i shouldn’t have told support that I hit a kangaroo. Now everything needs to go through them and it’s gonna be expensive.
I believe they gonna ripped the hell out of me with unrealistic repairs.
To be honest damages are not that bad. Wind screen, left front light and wing to be repaired…
I’m just hopeless how it’s gonna unfold…
Never heard any rental company that leaves the hirer fully liable for animal road incident…

Update after drop off:
Indie camper is asking for 7000$ for the repair at the check out.

No quote is even provided. I requested to check the quote, i’ve been denied…",1
Weak camper conditions,"It was our first camping trip with this company and unfortunately was a disappointment. The conditions of our camper were not the expected and the indicated for a long trip: at the departure the car oil was at the minimum, almost in reserve, the pneus without air, the gasoline almost in reserve, water was lacking in the clean paratroopes and we discovered two days later that one of the large drawers had been “arranged” with a little piece of paper. He left during the trip and could have caused something worse.
Also in the choice of the caravan there were crashes. We visited the rental space in January 2025 to see the options live and talk a little about the most suitable caravan. We gave all the details (travel in April, two children) and we were recommended the pop top: it decided to be a bad option because the bed above did not isolate the cold and the wind that was. We had quite cold every night.
As for the gas: we had a problem with the gas box and the assistance asked us to purchase a new box ensuring it was already spent (bought 4 days before the problem - at departure). We checked and actually the box was still full so we asked for help from a caravan driver who confirmed that the problem was the caravan and not the box.
Finally... a lot of crashes that could have been avoided if they had delivered a cart in good condition.
Experience with them not to repeat and we do not recommend the indie campers for a safe trip.",2
Never got started,"Had an email to pick up VW at Bristol airport. Could not find depot, since then found the depot has moved into town. Went to town depot, not one there, started 'live' chat, which is a joke. Three hours later at 20:00 got an email saying I couldn't pick it up today.
Next day turned up at the depot at 10:00, no one there again. 'Live' chat said the pick up time was 14:30 so we filled in time until 14:00 went to depot still no one there. Started 'live' chat again. Spent the next 2 hours awaiting a reply on 'live' chat. Left discussed.
Hoping as I haven't cancelled my booking but they will not supply a van I can get a full refund.",1
RV Hire - San Fran - Terrible On Trip support and complaints team,"We rented a Four Winds RV from Indie Campers in San Francisco. The hot water system never worked, even after following all instructions and refilling the propane ourselves at a cost of $50. We reported the issue during the trip through their ""On Trip"" support, which was completely useless.

On return, their own engineer confirmed there was a fault (not user error). Despite this, the ""complaints"" team tried to blame multiple things — including claiming we hadn’t purchased a separate gas canister (something never mentioned in the RV instructions) — which they later retracted after admitting they hadn’t checked properly. It showed they had no real understanding of their own product or setup.

Total cost of the rental was $1300, including a $200 ""set-up fee"" — a complete joke given the vehicle wasn’t properly checked before handover. Their final excuse was hiding behind their T&Cs instead of offering genuine customer service.

After weeks of chasing, they offered just $20 for the massive inconvenience of not having hot water for the entire trip.

Strongly recommend avoiding Indie Campers — terrible support, misinformation, and no accountability.",1
Just don’t,"Absolutely and wholeheartedly can’t recommend Indie Campers.

Booked a full 11kg gas bottle for my journey and got an illegal to use, way too old gas bottle which was also empty. Because of the age I couldn’t refill it at official refilling stations. After issuing a complaint I was told I don’t get a refund because I didn’t use the gas bottle. Make it make sense.

Further the heating system didn’t work on the first days with minus degrees outside and had to be reset thrice almost every time before usage.

The oil change was due in November 2024 (my rental was march 2025) and for that reason after less than 24hrs after pickup the oil service was due and I had to drive a detour to another depot.

The car overall was still dirty on the outside and dusty on the inside. Plus some food remains from previous renters were found. Even though I booked the after clean service, I had to clean the car from the out and inside before drop off in order to get my deposit back.

That is also a funny fact - in order for the local staff to review my claim for a partial refund because of the many issues on the road and for completing the drop off, I was told to leave a 5 star review on google. Otherwise no action will be taken. Also indie campers shortens the salary of the local staff, if there is an issue.

So overall, sh*t service, questionable condition of campers and horrendous working conditions.

There isn’t going to be a future rental experience with them and don’t trust the google reviews. Probably a lot of people who hoped for a refund for their services as well but never received any.",1
Trust the bad reviews,"RV camping is a great way to travel - just don’t do it with Indie Campers!

They provided me a nonfunctional vehicle. I’m not sure if it had even been inspected before they handed me the keys.

They started out by asking me to complete and email stating everything was in working order before I’d even seen the vehicle they were giving me.

As a first time renter I definitely didn’t have the knowledge of all the different components needed.

They pointed to a black tube explaining it was to dump the waste water. However - they did not provide an essential component of the tube and I only realized this when at the campsite and tried to connect it the first time. So I had to buy this piece.

Then I tried to fill the water tank. Neither of the 2 hoses worked so the next day I had to go back to the hardware store to buy this.

The customer service acted as if they were being gracious by offering to reimburse me the expenses! These are things I’d already paid for.

There was no hot water in the shower. So only hot showers were at the campsites we stayed at.

The website boasts a TV in the camper, it actually has hookups inside but there is absolutely no TV. It also says there is WiFi on board. Another lie.

I guess with all the other bad reviews I should have been forewarned. Please do an RV road trip just with another company! RV camping is really fun.",1
Scam. Avoid at all costs!,"We booked the biggest and most expensive RV from Indie Campers Las Vegas for 10 days.
10 hours before pickup I got an email that the RV is not available and we will get a smaller RV. Went there on time. Indie Campers Las Vegas looks like homeless center.
In 3 hours that we waited, only 2 families got their RV. Total of 7 families were waiting. Vehicles were given out when customer dropped them off *as they arrived*. They were dirty and malfunctioning.
When I started asking a firm question: ""Where is my RV?"", they threw us out.
We did not get any RV, our family vacation plans were ruined.

Place was dirty, no water, no coffee, no restrooms.
They have not refunded the money. Customer service is a joke.",1
Are we just unlucky?,"Writing this while on day 6 of our 2 week booking with Indie Campers.

Having had multiple issues with our vehicle which we collected in Faro, the latest is the last straw.

At 10.30 am usi g the company WhatsApp on trip support number we reported that the van would not start. After 1.30 hours we still had no acknowledgement from the company that they weee resolving our issue. We had to resort to finding local assistance after which we are now unable to switch off the engine without having to jump start the van.

I should note that this is not the only issue we have had with the vehicle none of which have been resolved

Shockingly bad customer service from Indie Campers and I will not be using them again after this",1
lousy.,"bad, you can not speak to anyone live. I had a booking downgrade from a motorhome camper to a normal motorhome. all communicated by email, I could not cancel the booking and I was not refunded anything.
Zero assistance, only millions of emails a BOT that answers you and if you want you have to call to the USA or Portugal. To be avoided without doubt",1
Skip Indie Camper San Diego office,"Save your money and a whole lot of frustration. Do not rent from this company. They broke their contract with me to provide a safe RV and I am still fighting with the company to get my money back.

I had tried to call the San Diego office a few days prior to confirm the reservation, change the drop off time, ask questions about their cleaning fees but they have no local phone number. I was routed to a call center in India. There is no way to directly talk to the person you are renting a RV from.

On the scheduled rental day, I arrived at the unmarked, filthy San Diego office (which was so gross it must violate a variety of healthy or safety codes) to find that the RV assigned to me was not in safe driving condition. The vanity cabinet inside the RV was broken with the shattered glass insert held together with tape. Broken glass in the passenger compartment of a moving vehicle is unacceptable to me. Not only was the RV dangerous to drive, but it had not been cleaned - dirty dishes in the sink, mouse droppings under the bed, exposed sewer hose in the under-bed outside storage, a horrible mold like stench throughout the RV, sand in the shower, ect. I was specifically told there was no other RV available for me to rent during my reservation window and there was no way to fix the dangerous cabinet in less than 24 hours. I walked away with no RV, and desperately scrambling to save my kids' spring break. I tried to call but got nowhere. I have sent multiple emails which have resulted in cut and paste style responses. They broke their contract with me to provide a safe RV and a month later I am still fighting with the company to get my money back.",1
Theft of forgotten items,"Forgotten things were stolen.
Nothing was allegedly found, although we had communicated the exact subject.
Absolutely untrustworthy!!!!",1
BAD experience. HIDDEN FEES.,"Booked at the Edinburgh branch for a 9 days roadtrip in the Scottish Highlands. Made to wait for 2 hours before we could pick up our van because their internal system was down and they had no idea when it would be back up. All we could do was wait.

When going through the vehicle before handover, we were informed that the UNLIMITED MILEAGE was actually a capped mileage system (at this point we were furious because this was not stated on the website OR in the booking AT ALL). When inspecting the vehicle, the staff didn't go through anything at all. We had to inspect the vehicle by ourselves to make sure that we had everything we paid for:

1. Water tank wasn't filled - had to ask for it to be refilled before we left.

2. Two of the cupboards were broken - had to ask for it to be fixed before we left. A staff member came to fix the two that we mentioned but there were other screws loose, one of which was the window blinds holder, and another was the other screw in the cupboard, that we ended up having to TAPE and RE-TAPE every single time before we drove off. It got so bad that the tape wasn't holding it together and we had to stuff our luggage in between the cupboard door and the bathroom wall so that it wouldn't fly open during the drive. We contacted Indiecamper support but all we got was 'the depot is closed' and 'you will be charged if post-inspection states that the items are damaged by users'. No other help was rendered. We have receipts of the exchange with the support/ roadside assistance in both Whatsapp and Email.

3. We purchased the bedding from them but was only given ONE even though there were TWO beds. Asked for an extra bedding but was told that it would be an additional cost of £50+ (this is ridiculous). The beddings, when we fitted the sheets and pillows, smelled weird.

4. Even after waiting nearly 2 hours to pick up the vehicle, no discounts were offered to us as compensation. We had to ask if they could give us the extra bedding for free as compensation, and were told yes begrudgingly. Customer service was pretty much non-existent at the shop itself.

After returning the vehicle, the checks were not done in front of us. Instead, we were told that we were okay to go and that the deposit would be refunded to us within 5 days. Nothing showed up in the bank account within 5 days. About 2 weeks later, we received an email stating the damages incurred, 2 of which were caused by a third-party vehicle, on the side of the vehicle, which during pick up, the staff mentioned that it's covered under the Basic plan insurance that comes with every Indiecamper rental. Without any inquiry about the damages, they instantly charged our card without notifying us beforehand. Also, the amount incurred for the damages (apparently according to Indiecamper's OWN price table, which we don't get to see, and was not notified of beforehand) was almost 2 TIMES the amount quoted to us from a local repair shop in Scotland, which is extremely ridiculous because the original quoted cost by the local repair shop is already very pricey. It was also very unprofessional of them to simply charge the card without prior approval from the card holder.

No compensation was offered for the internal cupboards that were broken for the ENTIRE duration of our trip. Card was charged before any prior approval was given. No communication and extremely lacklustre customer service. Would NEVER recommend them ever.",1
STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY,"Terrible Experience – Unauthorised Charges and Unsafe Vehicle

I would strongly advise against booking with Indie Campers. Our experience was a disaster from start to finish, and it completely ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing holiday.

First of all, the van we received was in terrible condition – it was old, poorly maintained, and quite frankly falling apart. Within the first day, the cupboard screws came loose, and things were rattling and falling off. It felt unsafe to drive, and we spent most of the trip worrying about whether the vehicle would even hold together.

The worst part? Indie Campers charged our bank account for a damage that should have been fully covered under the basic insurance plan we purchased. The damage was inflicted by another car driving into us at a round about. These charges were made without our authorisation, and we received no satisfactory explanation or breakdown of the costs. It felt like a scam.

To make matters worse, customer service was completely unhelpful both before and during the trip. We tried reaching out several times but were either ignored or met with vague responses that didn't address our concerns.

Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for a campervan rental. This company is not trustworthy, and their vehicles are not safe.",1
At your own risk,"With Indiecampers, you not only risk ruining your holiday, you also risk your lives.
Not only was the vehicle we were entrusted with very poorly maintained (which forced us to return twice to the depot to have it repaired!); but above all, the campervan was equipped with summer tires, in Iceland!!!
With snow that can come on the roads at any time, we left on the side, vehicle stuck in the middle of a snowstorm and having to resort to an overpriced breakdown.

If you have already booked, take the time to check ALL the essential equipment (tyres, headlights, windscreen wipers, windscreen raisers, electrical control console, heating, gas and water, at least).

Apart from the summer tires, the control console of all the electrical equipment that breaks down, the torn windscreen wiper, and the window raiser buttons that operate randomly: car radio that does not turn on, worrying engine (engine overhaul light that turns on, particulate filter warning light that lights up...), suspended bed that comes off along the way, heating system that issues alerts, the gray water valve that does not work, the camper van manual not found, the bedding kit and the crockery kit frankly not up to standard.

And finally the campervan was all damaged everywhere, although they warn well at the start that the slightest scratch will be charged a hundred euros, despite the insurance taken out. One wonders what they do with these penalties since obviously they do not repair their vehicles.",1
You should read this ->,"Renting in Indie Campers was the worst thing we have done in a long time, we were given a caravan of 5 with many scratches, blows and shattered in which the water never worked, told us that water is missing in the tank., filled it up, we realized at 200km that it also did not work like this, we called them and they did not give us any solution, we asked the boy where the 5th person sat and told us a seat without belt that has on it a sticker that says ""do not go there in travel"" the tires are summer on a trip through the north of Iceland in April where many of the roads had snow and ice, we almost killed ourselves, we have been in a car park 8 hours trying to talk to them and no one answers because the battery does not work and the caravan does not start, all this paying the premium plan that is supposed to have 24/7 assistance. You are in time to find another place to rent All photos are from when we were given the campervan.",1
Abusive repair cost,"I put this assessment because I can't put less.
We made a small dent (about 2 centimeters) in the ceiling. Despite having the premium coverage we have been charged 1,750 euros, cost totally disproportionate to the actual value of the repair.
The worker's treatment was correct.
I do not recommend that you use this rental company ha that any setback, however small, can ruin your trip and your economy.",1
"Disappointing, bad customer service","I rented a Jeep Wrangler from Indie Campers for a 4-night trip from their San Francisco branch, and the experience was pretty disappointing.

The pick-up was slow and disorganised. I waited around 30 minutes just for someone to take a few photos of the vehicle. The staff didn’t seem to know what was included with my booking — I had to specifically ask for the bedding kit, gas cooker, and even the ladder for the roof tent. If I hadn’t brought it up, I doubt they would’ve provided them at all.

Once on the road, we found that the “Travel Essentials Kit” I paid extra for was missing key items. The bedding was just a couple of pillows in plastic bags — no duvet or blanket, which was frustrating once we reached our first campsite. The camp kitchen setup was also damaged: the sink extension had no support and just hung loose, so it couldn’t be used properly.

Drop-off was even worse. I’d paid extra for a late return at 7pm and arrived early at 6:20pm — but the depot was completely locked. I called customer support several times. The first person didn’t seem to know anything about my booking and said they’d call back, but never did. After over an hour of waiting and more calls, someone eventually showed up at 7:40pm with no apology or explanation.

There’s also a hefty “preparation fee,” which doesn’t reflect the condition of the vehicle or the gear we received. I contacted customer service after the trip to explain everything, but they weren’t willing to offer any refund or compensation.

Overall, the service didn’t match the price, and I wouldn’t rent from Indie Campers again.",1
They ruined my holiday,"They just ruined a holiday of 10 days for two people who had been working hard in the last months looking forward to this 10 days of holidays, who arrived in Perth for a rent that could never start.

THEY ADMITTED THAT A GLITCH ON THEIR WEBSITE IS LATELY CAUSING THIS PROBLEM TO SEVERAL RENTALS. THIS IS UNACCETTABLE!

We arrived on time for the pick up of the campervan, with the food and stock shopping already done for the next 10 days just to find out there is no vehicle for us, even if we did the check in two days ago on their website. We even received an email from them only a few hours before the pick up time confirming our rental.

The customer service is only offering us a refund of what we spent for the rent (which is the least as legally requested since we had no chance to start the rent) OR 4 nights paid in a hotel, with low budget, and then a campervan from the 24th April.
We arrived from Melbourne just for this trip and we booked AND PAID a campervan. As a campervan is a substitute for both a car and a hotel we found ourselves with empty hands",1
Cancel reservation on the spot,"Calgary depot canceled our reservation without any notice or compensation, although we flew all the way there. Terrible customer service. Avoid at all cost.",1
SCAM,"OUTRAGEOUS
Don't trust these crooks and liars.
On the surface everything is beautiful on their ads and social networks but the reality is a nightmare.
We rented a van for 2 weeks in Australia.
Despite the relative cleanliness of the vehicle and the concerns related to the electrical system for autonomy, everything went well until the return of the vehicle.
The inventory is proceeding normally and the agent has me sign the document for the return of the security deposit.
But three weeks later we receive an email telling us that they proceeded to debit €1230 with the credit card for a supposed scratch on the bumper.
How can we afford to use our credit card more than 3 weeks after returning the deposit?
We do not receive any invoices, nor proof of the exhorbitant amount but just 2 photos ""Check in,Check out"" of the vehicle.
These photos appear modified in their favor but do not clearly show the stripes accused..
On the other hand, we can clearly see that the vehicle is damaged in the same place in the 2 photos.
They therefore blame us for a damage already present on the vehicle!
Despite an exchange of 30 e-mails with 4 different people from the complaints department, no refund was made.
This service is catastrophic, in bad faith and never answers our questions or takes into consideration the evidence we provide.
They are justified by an article of their contract, which they know by heart how to divert a word from a sentence. Obviously this article does not apply to me.
You feel like you're talking to robots, practicing how to spit out speech and typical phrases learned by heart.
Once they have taken the money, they look away from the obvious evidence of their fraudulent scheme to never repay.
It is a disgrace that this company can still rent vehicles and take advantage of their customer to extract exorbitant and unjustified amounts.
We have made a report to the DGCFRB to denounce these practices.",1
Be careful of this Company,"Our experience with indie campers: Extremely bad. Please don't touch this company.
We made a reservation a year ago and didn't get a camper in the end. All vehicles were in extremely poor technical condition and uncleaned and disgusting from the inside. Mold and rust, some windows fixed with armor tape etc.
We cancelled our trip and then it took us forever (20 emails with support) to get our money back. Transaction fees of ~250€ go to our account. Just beware. It borders on rip-off!",1
They don't offer any service for there customers,"Be wise, choice another company for a trip with a campervan. Look at my Google review for further information.
BAD company",1
"Would you pay £1,500 for a trip with fake support?","Would you pay £1,500 for a trip with fake support? I did—and I’ll never do it again.

We booked with Indie Campers (Edinburgh) as first-time vehicle hirers: four adults, one of whom was pregnant. What was meant to be a memorable birthday getaway quickly turned.

Start with the basics: the vans are not fit for purpose. They’re unsecure, anyone can access the interior via exterior service compartments, for which we were given no key. From our experience, and from reviews we’ve now seen from around the world, I can’t recommend them from any depot.

Check-in was rushed. There was no demonstration, just a quick verbal overview. Before we’d even loaded our bags, a staff member moved the van and crashed it into another, shattering a rear light that was never repaired. Still excited, we signed the handover form, unaware this was just the start.

Once we set off and drove 200 miles to begin our carefully planned trip, we discovered:
1. The toilet didn’t work, very concerning especially with a pregnant passenger.
2. The windscreen blinds wouldn’t close, compromising privacy.
3. No key for the service compartments, making the van completely unsecure.

We’d paid nearly £200 for “premium insurance” with promises of “roadside assistance” and “on-trip support.” In reality? Support was WhatsApp-only, and every solution required us to pay upfront—even for repairs.

I contacted support from night one to late the next afternoon. Their two suggestions:
Visit a repair centre at our own cost (vague reimbursement promised as they had to use whatsapp to confirm if they would)
Drive 200 miles back to Edinburgh (we’d paid for mileage upgrades—this alone would’ve cost us 400 miles)

We chose the repair centre. Embarrassingly, they had no notice from indie (and had never worked on an indie van), no parts, and no time for us. Indie’s suggestion? Try another garage or head back to base. I explained the urgency: no toilet, no security, no privacy. They didn’t care and their messages were extremely patronising, repetitive and included troubleshooting videos of random youtube people using equipment that was not in the van we had(?).

I requested escalation. Their response: still no phone calls, just WhatsApp or email. They did offer to reimburse two campsite stays as a “goodwill gesture” for the toilet but the only options were still: fix it yourself or drive back.

Eventually, they said they’d contact a second repair location. When the time came, they instead sent me the number and told me to call. I refused- they own the van, not me. I requested roadside assistance again. Their response: “Support is WhatsApp-only.”

We gave up. I’d wasted hours of my holiday trying to get help. We continued the trip, feeling deflated.

When we returned the van, the staff laughed it off and apologised. No power to help, they “just work there”. We later discovered the toilet never even had a fuse installed—despite paying £173 for a “preparation fee”. Clearly, no one had checked the van.

Their final compensation offer? A whopping 8% refund, not even covering the prep fee to acknowledge they didn't check the van was fit. For a ruined, stressful, and unsafe experience.

This review barely scratches the surface, but please- don’t book with Indie Campers. They offer no real support, no accountability, and no one to talk to. What should have been a special trip became a stressful ordeal. I am now going back and forth on email with apparently the highest I can possibly go in their complaints team (the name changes all the time so clearly they all just pick up messages) and am getting absolutely nowhere. They are yet to acknowledge and respond to 90% of my complaint.

If you’ve already booked with them, I urge you to rethink. Don’t let your holiday become a disaster like ours.",1
"DO NOT USE THIS TERRIBLE, DECEIVING COMPANY!!!","DO NOT USE THIS TERRIBLE, DECEIVING COMPANY!!! Unfortunately, this company absolutely spoilt our once in a lifetime trip up the east coast of Australia. I have waited for a month to leave this review until we had escaped the hidden 30 day period, in which they reserve the right to hold the almost £1800 deposit, and take any further occurring fees!! Having read the reviews, my partner and I have been unsure as to whether to leave this review due to Indie Campers threatening policies and other customers’ experiences! We had no heads up about the tolls throughout the states, which was a total faff trying to sort out. Just a pre warning for anyone deciding to go with Indie, do your research on the tolls etc to avoid those extra costs and admin fees at the end. Another heads up, if you are hoping to freedom camp, be aware locals don’t like it! After checking with the locals in Broome, we were told there was no issues with us sleeping in the cul-de-sac. We spent the afternoon and evening there, quietly and with the van open incase anyone wanted to chat to us. We went to sleep at 21:30 and were then woken up by an enormous bang at 22:20ish. We rushed out the van to find a bright yellow and black hazard style sticker on the bumper saying ‘YOU PARK LIKE A C***T, DO THE WORLD A FAVOUR AND DESTROY YOUR LICENSE’. We believe someone had thrown a firecracker at us. We checked around, but it was pitch black and we couldn’t see, or hear anything. Anyhow, we were missing a grey water hose which we were told to go and buy and they would reimburse us, never received that money. Within a couple of days, we had water pouring from underneath the van whenever we ran anything inside. We suspected a blockage so bought some unblocker. That didn’t work. We contacted the ‘24/7’ contact number which is only WhatsApp, despite me requesting a phone number to call, to which they refused. After suggesting drain unblocker, they advised us to drive over an hour from the Blue Mountains back to the outskirts of Sydney to an RV garage. We changed our plans and left the following morning reaching the garage at 8am when it opened. We were then almost laughed off the site after being told ‘no chance, we’re booked up for the next 3 months’. After receiving the same message from the next garage that they hadn’t contacted, Indie Campers took from 9am until 1:30pm to give us a response as to what they wanted us to do with their van. We were told the branch in Sydney were not able to help us???? A garage was then booked in for the Monday morning in Port Macquarie over 400km away. So that’s now Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Mondays plans spoilt chasing around a problem with Indie Campers van, 4 days out of our 21. I requested that there was some kind of compensation, we were told it has been passed onto complaints, Ha, good one! We didn’t hear a peep about that after making several more requests over the next month. The garage helped us and fixed the problem on Monday. Unfortunately, we were coming to the end of our trip during Cyclone Alfred. We contacted Indie Campers again and asked for some advice as to what to do in terms of getting the van back, but received very little help. We drove for 6 hours on the Sunday through the worst driving conditions I’ve ever been in. We gave the van back on the Monday morning and were told all was good and that we’d get our deposit back soon by the fantastic staff at the Brisbane office, hats off to them. Having left Brisbane for our next destination, later on that day I suddenly wondered when exactly we would receive our deposit back, so messaged Indie again. This is when the tone completely changed, passive aggressive, rude and blunt. All customer service had gone out of the window at this point. This is when we learnt they could keep our deposit for up to 30 days. Almost £1800 when you’re away on holiday can really effect plans!! After arguing over message, I attempted to ring the Brisbane office using the number from google to find that it is a dead line?! I then used google maps to find a nearby business, rang them and request they go over to Indie Campers and ask the manager to call me. Will rang me and was fantastic, he explained the van was all good, nothing to worry about and that our deposit should be back within 6 days. On the 5th day, I received an email from Indie Campers essentially blackmailing me by telling me that they will not release the deposit until I had left a review. Well, having read others reviews I felt I had no choice but to leave a good review at the fear they would then find scratches dents, marks or unicorn hair and charge us a fortune. The money came back, thank god. No sign of any compensation or even a message/email regarding it. Absolute money grabbing, scamming, unhelpful, holiday spoiling crooks.",1
Terrible service,"We rented the camper in Iceland for 7 days and as a first impression it did not go as we expected. In fact it was not delivered in good condition... tires that had to be spiked by now were totally worn, internal cleaning questionable... dirty mattresses, kitchen and stove with fouling, broken toilet cap and consequently unpleasant smells all the time... and to conclude the fridge was really in terrible condition, in fact every time it opened it came out a vomit smell.
Roadside assistance also questionable... we got bogged down in the snow (again because of worn tires) and we were not given any assistance... indeed we had to call a tow truck at our expense.
Finally, more than a week after our return after the deposit had been returned to us, they tried to charge us more than 700€ for a line that was noticed in a second revision (the one that was written to us by email), not provoked by us.
An email was sent via lawyer in response to this payment and at that point they backed out writing to us that they were wrong...
(Please know that before starting the deposit return they will ask you for overall feedback)
We're not picky people and we've made do, but that's not how you treat a customer...
For us it will be the first and last time",1
DO NOT USE,"Misold our campervan.
Booked with water but had no access.
At pick up we were told we would receive compensation as we booked and paid for a van with water and ours didn't. Even though we had our confirmation clearly stating water.

Bedding was stained and had holes.
Stereo never worked.
The generator didn't work.
Van dirty and contact support everyday.

Tries to give them a chance to settle it before reaching the trade commission and reviews but nothing prevailed.
Shocked at the service and have photos as evidence.",1
Should be avoided,A rental company that tries to charge you the maximum deductible they can and also earn money from overcharged extras. very bad business traits and next to no customer service. should be avoided,1
DO NOT RENT FROM INDIE CAMPERS,"This company is not trustworthy. The only way to communicate is via their site and so as we encountered issues, we had to wait to get a response. The check-in procedure was very brief and they did not give us the opportunity to review the camper itself. The cleaning kit was a joke with no real broom or trash can and we paid extra for that. There was no tv in the camper. The chairs that we paid extra for were junk and kept falling apart. There were screws that fell out that we could have driven over and popped a tire. Furthermore the camper was not clean when received; we found candy wrappers the first night. The hook ups were loose at the camper and we struggled with every hook up and unhooking. The electrical connection was not even connected at the top (see pics). Of course we didn’t discover that until we hooked up the first time. The water connection leaked the whole time. The middle step into the camper kept coming unhooked and posed a major risk to my 80-year old mother. Most of the switches are not labeled and that was very frustrating. When I brought these issues to their attention, I was told that since we accepted the camper as it was there’s nothing they will do. Honestly I want a significant refund because this whole experience has been such a nightmare.",1
HORRIBLE HEARTLESS CROOKS!,"DO NOT BE LURED BY LOW PRICES OR PROMISES!
Make no mistake. This company should be put out of business! You are nothing but a dollar sign to them, and they will steal your money, your time, and your peace if you give them the chance. They basically stole $2,000 dollars from me. Danish Saleem had absolutely no empathy for my issue and did not care that I would be out $2,000. He could only parrot policies and did not seem to understand that they were taking my money without delivering a service or product.",1
Super frustrating,"Indie campers, is an armature company who turned a peaceful trip into an horrible experience full of frustration.
Especially when waiting to get my money refund back.
They gave me false information about the insurance, then when called me back to say that the information provided was wrong I brought the vehicle back and demanded full refund.

They didn’t pay me back for the fuel I put in the vehicle (I received it 1/4 full and returned it 3/4 full)
Saying that my bank transaction wasn’t enough proof of charge.
Moreover having to run after them all the time for updates.
I highly recommend staying far away",1
Ladri,"Very bad. days after the return of the camper and after checking it they send us a photo of an alleged scratch near the wheel, taking from the card the 500 euros deposit and asking for another 700.
After I had taken out premium insurance and the campervan was rechecked on the way back.
Now I'm going to have to waste time and money on a lawyer.
I strongly advise against it",1
Unfair practices to the detriment of the consumer,"My experience with Indie Campers was extremely negative due to repeated incorrect payment requests, opaque management and Premium insurance that proved almost useless. Following damage to a door, I was presented with a quote, as the insurance does not cover some parts of the van (spoiler: there is no deductible). The costs should be determined by a price list, but I was asked for an incorrect amount, trying to subtract the deposit of €199 again, without mentioning it in the document. Only after my complaints was the error acknowledged and the amount corrected.
Subsequently, after settling the remaining €1.954 for the damages listed and assessed at check out in my presence and despite seeming out of proportion, a week later I was informed that the balance had been changed because they had reassessed the damage. But how? Wasn't there an ""objective"" price list?
As if that wasn't enough, Indie Campers initially denied receiving the balance, claiming they only took the deposit. Only after providing irrefutable proof of payment did they admit the error. According to the contract, Indie Campers has 30 days to charge further damages, fines, etc. and that is what I think they march on. The reality is that they sent me back the same document, with the same damages, but recalculated differently.
Initially the total damage was €1,954, then it became €2,639, but at times I was even asked for €3,124. When asked for an explanation, they simply forwarded the same document, without any concrete justification for the price changes, claiming that they had the right to internally reassess the damages.
Meanwhile, reminders of payment continue to arrive with threats of legal action, without the actual amount owed being clarified first.
After the umpteenth email in which I asked to speak to someone (impossible) or to receive detailed evidence on the changes in the amounts because otherwise I would proceed to report everything, their response was that they had already communicated previously that they were evaluating the situation and the discrepancies mentioned (by me).
No concrete explanation, no immediate solution, just a generic answer that does not address the problems raised in the least.
Their method seems to be this: they ask you for money with varying amounts; they threaten you with legal action; they do not provide the evidence solicited to support their claims; they do not allow you to talk to a manager; Only if you notice mistakes (after endless emails), they reassess the figure and ask you to bear with them. All this happens almost a month after the end of the trip... and the story is not over yet!

In conclusion:
Bad experience, zero transparency and payment requests without any logic. If you are considering renting a campervan with IndieCampers, read the contract carefully and be very careful: they may charge you unjustified costs, and Premium insurance may not protect you as you think.",1
The worst experience with a camper we've ever lived,"Our experience was very negative. We were never told how many robberies there were in Rome. And on top of being victims of a vandalism, they came in and took out practically everything, to get in they smashed glass from the driver. We had to replace it on our own, since Índie Camper (during business hours according to Google) there was no one to attend us and replace the unit or change the glass. Where the assistant WhatsApp sent us to repair, they have no emergency, they have no glass either....!!!! We walked many km trying to get glass as it rained and it was very cold and we did not want to get away from our belongings.
When we return with the glass changed, the bill x that glass and the police complaint, we are told that the glass, original for being from another company Do not recognize it!!!! Pathetic because the same assistance to the traveler had recommended us to change it so that we could continue with our trip safely. One pays the premium franchise to avoid situations like these, but large companies cmo Indie Campers thinks in your pocket only.
We have travelled with other companies before, this time we wanted to change.... I do not recommend them!!!! Be careful, don't be naive like us😭",1
No respect for the customer,"Indie Campers = Completely useless customer service!
Mail, chat, pec...it doesn't help: they reply with pre-set phrases, copy/paste and your problem remains.

My case: while waiting for the invoice (after more than a month of payment) I explained that I had a deadline for reporting (almost 2,000 € of advance spending) and that I would lose the refund if I did not receive the invoice by a certain date. Nothing to do, after 15 days still nothing. And I threw away 2,000€! Thank you...you will never see me again!",1
STAY AWAY!! They don't care about the travelers AT ALL.,"I would NEVER NEVER use this company again. I went with them as their website seemed detailed and they have a world wide presence. Our experience was EXPENSIVE and FRUSTRATING! We paid for ""out of hours"" pick up, which they said they could not accommodate. They would not refund. Quality of van horrible--holes in sheets, dirty blanket, ripped, seats, inoperable lights, refrig smelled of fish, cigarette smoke in bathroom, sand in all of the cabinets. A big thing was safety as the passenger chair would not lock in place and swivel sometimes on it's own. We went to a local gas station and grocery store to stock up and the gas light came on in the first mile. While putting the groceries away, we found the horrible smells and we went back to ask for a new van, but we couldn't reverse the van as no one told us how. They had us wait over an hour and told us to open the windows. You could tell they were mad at us now as they were nice when we first got there but totally ignored us when we showed them our concerns. I had called prior to our arrival and asked about propane, and there was another extra fee for that. We only were able to use shower once as water ran under door and down the middle of the van. So we had to pay for campsites with showers since the van one was unusable. We called for help multiple times and spend hours getting the run around. I would never use this again as it wasted SO much time trying to reach anyone for help or fix things to keep going on our adventure. Now that I've heard others horror stories, ours wasn't so bad, but I never want to pay that much to stay in a filthy broken van again.",1
Hidden costs!,"Terrible experience with indie campers.
We booked a campervan and was super excited till a few days passed we checked our emails just to double check every thing and there was SO many hidden costs that we was not told about! More than half the price more ! We messaged to find this out and they did not want to know. We asked to change dates to reduce our time in the camper, but that was so much money also.
So we cancelled the whole campervan with the 100% refund. And still lost £150!",1
Worst campervan experience ever!,"I have rented many campers before but never have I had a worse experience than with Indie Campers. You pay a ton of extra fees for service and preparation of your camper before pickup (about $800 in total!) And then they rent you a camper for 2 weeks that has a faulty heating system. With temperature near the freezing temperature we had to book 7 nights of accommodation cause it was ice ice cold in our van. Both me and my partner got super sick and our 1.5 year old as well. Upon contacting their customer service they were super unhelpful. They just make some suggestions: you can try this, or this. But nothing works and the problem remains. Then they suggest to buy a portable heater...
Our fridge also had mold in it and the drawers were not cleaned.
After returning the van everything was cleared upon inspection. And now 5 days later I get an email saying I need to pay for damages. With 2 shady photos included without the license plate' visible nor a time stamp. They say they will simply charge my credit card. Indie Campers is a fraudulent company and I highly disencourage you to hire a camper with them.",1
SCAMMERS,"I would NOT touch this company with a ten foot pole. Do not trust the 5 star reviews, when I seen the bad reviews, I thought it would never happen to me. But I hired a campervan through them, and I’ve been charged almost $2k for damages I did not make. If you do hire through them take photos of everything, inside and out, and even then, expect them to come back at you 3 months later claiming you’ve made damages. They couldn’t even give me a mechanic quote, just fake quotes created by Word Documents. There are Facebook groups with hundreds of people that have been scammed by this fraudulent company",1
Lack of customer care,"They don't have the insurance for the upper and inferior parts of the vans, l DON'T RECOMMEND TO GO WITH THEM IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED, if you damage the vehicle in the upper and inferior part they will charge you everything (and for the van every damage is multiplied)",1
Do not use indie campers munich,"The service of this company is a scam. I returned a camper without any incidents. A week later, they charged me 2000 euros for a small dent in the back, which was not present when I returned the vehicle. Moreover, incredibly, this was not covered by the insurance I had purchased, and it is inconceivable that such a small repair could have cost 2000 euros. After checking other traveler review sites, I found that, unfortunately, this is a common practice of Indie Campers, which tend to be cheaper than other camper rental companies but systematically impose these unjustified additional charges.",1
Scammer masquerading as a camper hire (my opinion). Steer clear! BE CAREFUL!!!!,"I rented a vehicle in Sydney, Australia for this Portuguese-based company. The vehicle seems to or was probably previously damaged at the time of pick up. When I returned the vehicle, I made the observation that the window had some damage, expecting it would be covered by their ""protection plan"", and if not, by my travel insurance. A few days later, apart from the bond, I was charged more, without any notice. Soon, I had been charged literally tens of thousands of dollars on my debit card. I complained, requested repair invoices to provide to the travel insurance and all requests were evaded. I went to Fair Trading NSW, but this was ignored. I then lodged a case with the NSW Civil & Administrative Tribunal (NCAT), which is legally binding and enforceable, only then did they start to provide some information, which was however inconsistent. After more than year from having rented the vehicle, the NCAT Member made an order to return my funds. I'm lucky to have seen the back of this, even if I was made ""whole"", I wasted so much time to recover my funds.",1
Poor customer service and very poor van quality,"Indie Camper New Zealand:
We paid for an early pick up time in Christchurch and did not actually receive assistance and our vehicle for two hours after this. We were still charged an early pick up fee and have to now go through AI bots at customer service to try and get a refund because the retail rep at the Christchurch location didn’t put in the refund request like she said they would. The staff was disorganized and clearly did not have the van ready for us at pick up despite booking an early time well in advance.

We also had several issues with the van that were unacceptable for the amount we paid for it;

-One of the cabinets was duct taped closed and was unusable
-The table leg and windshield also had duct tape holding them in place which was rather concerning about the integrity of the windshield.
-We were not given a gray water hose and had to find another camper to lend us theirs to empty our vehicle.
-The gray water tank was also full upon arrival and we had to deal with this our first day of camping.
-the fuel level was less than 1/4 tank on pick up so we had to immediately find a fuel station before starting our drive.

Overall our customer service experience was very poor and it is impossible to contact a human to help with issues, you just keep getting routed to chat bots that don’t actually get back to you.

Due to our issues with the van and poor service I would not recommend Indie Camper to anyone looking to travel.",1
WORST EXPERIENCE,"DO NOT EVER rent with this company. It is dangerous and not worth your money. I just went through the worst experience in my life. They do not inspect the vehicles, delivered a dirty vehicle after a 2 hours wait in the dark, car's fuel meter did not work, rotten food inside the cooler, dirty nest. Don't do it, you will regret. (I have all the proof)",1
"Strict Policies, No Refunds, and Total Frustration","I booked a camper van with Indie Campers Van Australia based on some online reviews, and things just went south from there. My visa didn't get approved, so I couldn't even make it to Australia, but they still charged me $1,338.99 AUD, no refund, no rescheduling, and not even a little room for negotiation. I mean, life happens, right? It’s really frustrating when a company insists on this rigid policy no matter what goes on.

I felt like they were just taking my money with no care about my situation. It’s hard to believe that I ended up spending so much for a service I never even got to use. I’ve had some pretty bad experiences before, but this one really takes the cake. It’s just not fair to expect people to pay the full amount when unforeseen things, like visa issues, come up.

I don’t recommend Indie Campers Van Australia at all. Save yourself the headache and consider other options if you’re planning a trip.",1
🚨 Avoid Indie Campers – Unfair Deposit Charges & Terrible Customer Service! 🚨,"🚨 Avoid Indie Campers – Unfair Deposit Charges & Terrible Customer Service! 🚨

My husband and I rented a campervan from Indie Campers in Edinburgh in May 2023, leaving a deposit of almost £1,700. Upon return, their staff inspected the vehicle with us present and confirmed there was NO damage. They assured me the deposit would be fully refunded within 6 days.

After a week, I received an email claiming they found a scratch during a post-return inspection and charged me the full deposit! The so-called “evidence” they provided was undated pictures, and they refused to show the photos taken at the actual return inspection. They even admitted in writing that they missed the scratch during the initial check, yet they still charged me!

🔹 No timestamped proof of damage at the time of return
🔹 Refusing to provide original inspection photos
🔹 Ignoring my GDPR data request (UK GDPR and EU GDPR violations which can result in fines of up to £20 million or 4% of annual global turnover)
🔹 Unfair contract terms (30 days to charge damages with no proof the van wasn’t used)
🔹 Extortionate repair cost with no itemized invoice

I have reported Indie Campers to UK Trading Standards, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and the Portuguese Privacy Regulator (CNPD). If they do not refund my deposit, I will be taking legal action.

This company uses unfair terms to scam customers out of their deposits. BEWARE before booking with them! 🚨 #Scam #IndieCampers #Avoid",1
Inexistent Failure,"As I've read in other comments, I've also been the victim of the clutches on the ceiling. We returned the cart on 05/11/2024, with a check-out ok, signed without any failure. Two weeks later was debited in my card 800 euros from a knotted on the upper frontal column. Claiming they hadn't seen.
Do not rent with this company, and if you rent, when you deliver the vehicle, take photos of everything on site.",1
SCAM COMANY DOCUMENTATION,"So I have been looking forward to this trip in more than 2 months now. We have booked a Jeep Wrangler and suddenly I got an email 4 days prior arrival, that it has changed to a Suzuki Jimny which is a car that cost ⅓ of the price of a Jeep, it is too small for our luggage and we have to sleep on the ground which is no go for me in Australia. Any price compensation? - no. Possible to get to customer service? - no - Could I still book the exact same order here three days before arrival? - yes. So this proffs that we have a scam company that sells a dream but deliver you something compeletely different at the same price. No options to get refunds og change your booking. And of course I feel so stupid when reading many of the exact same reviews here three days before arrival - and here is another one for you to consider.. So please, think before you use this company.",1
TO AVOID « INDIE CAMPERS •,"1st experience with Indie Campers Oslo was GREAT
2nd experience with Indie Campers London was not bad , we didn’t get the van we wanted but the van worked well and there is no problem till the return

3rd Experience Indie Campers Marseille is very bad. We rented it for 2weeks
Van had problems 2 hours since we picked it up at Marseille depot for 3 days .. we spent our time on the phones and emails , all the garage were busy and closed before Christmas
We paid 118€/ day for unlimited KM
They reimboursed us only 250€

Day 4 changed the van in Bruxelles, problem with gas cylinder and water tank leaks.
we had to stop at IC in Paris to get the right cylinder
Till the last day , no problem with the van. brought back the van to the depot in Marseille , everything was fine.
4 days later … SURPRISE ! They charged us 1200€ for the damage on the front left bumper.
They sent us photo that we can see very clear there is no damage on the front left bumper ,
(Check the photos below)
In fact when we took the car , the right bumper is already broken.
So they tried to make us pay for the reparation of the broken bumper the right one.
We spent 3 days on the phone calls and emails. And we are ready to go further with the lawyer and even go on the TV or radio programs .
Finally they reimbursed our 1200€ and mentioned that it was an error 😡
So yes i can tell you don’t waste your holiday with this scammer company
Or if you have to the. Make sure to check the van carefully , makes video (pick up and drop condition of the van) ask the staff to sign

As of the card that you use as the deposit, contact your bank as soon as you got the van to make sure there is no final surprise

What I can say is GOOD LUCK 👍",1
THIEVES,"🚫DO NOT RENT WITH INDIE CAMPERS, they charge your credit cards months after the end of the rental, amounts for damage to the cars, which never happened, they charged me more than two extra amounts of more than $400. They leave free access to make you charges to your credit card and use it to accuse you of damage to vehicles that you never did. In addition, they do not have phone numbers to call to make inquiries. They are THIEVES.",1
Caravan with engine problems and no return of paid diaries and no replacement of vehicle,"We rented a caravan in Rome (reserve 0YQ7PK) and simply on the day 10/01/2025 the caravan had a problem in the engine, we stopped in the highway for 43KM from Florence, the assistance of the highway arrived and rebounded to a nearby city (PISTÓIA- Italia), which would have an authorized FIAT workshop, only that in the workshop they did not do this kind of service was only sale and revision of new cars and there began the despair.
We contacted the idie by the emergency wattsaap and had to send a new trailer to take the caravan to a workshop and a taxi to take us to Florence so we could pick up a replacement caravan. Which didn't happen. We had to sleep ""on the street"" without energy, in the cold of 3 degrees because we had no way to move to a camping.
The other day (11/01/2025) a trailer arrived and no taxi arrived to take us to Florence, they took the caravan to an office and informed us that they had not obtained any taxi service to make our transfer and that in the warehouse in Florence there was no caravan available for exchange, and they informed us that it was to give us the way to get out of there and share all receipts for refund, we requested the cancellation of the other reservation days we still had and the extra kilometers we paid since we still had 3 days of daily.
We took a train to Floreça and from there another train to Lisboa, as we had a ticket from Rome to Lisbon for only 4 days, when we would deliver the caravan and follow to our next destination.
They informed that the refund would take place in 10 days, because after all these days we only had a refund of half the value, still lacking $460,00.
When contacted by the same Watssap we were informed that we should contact by e-mail because the complaints team would have already been communicated and would give continuity to the refund, since so far nothing of the refund and simply do not answer any more e-mails.",2
Dreadful Experience,"We hired a Conqueror camper van from San Francisco. It was not ready at the agreed time of 1pm after an hour delay we were introduced to the vehicle only to discover the battery was dead and that had to be replaced. We were required to select our own cutlery, plates, cooking pots, bedding etc - all of which had been pre-ordered. We finally left at 2.30pm which resulted in arriving after dark at our first booked site. The cooking pots required serious cleaning before we could use them as they were covered in grime. The following morning we discovered that the shower screen leaked water over the whole of the vehicle floor and the towels we had been provided with were filthy and only good for soaking up the water. These then needed to be dried! We were told to get some silicone for the shower screen but that did not work. We subsequently discovered that the hot water system was leaking - probably the heat exchanger. We consequently spent our whole 25 days without hot water or a shower, having to use campsite showers and boiling all our hot water requirements! We were not provided with the chemical 'tabs' that we had ordered and paid for. There was no plug for the kitchen sink and after a number of attempts to buy one we ended up buying a container to wash up in. There was no privacy screen for the front windscreen The tank indicators did not function correctly. Although we turned the freezer to maximum and used electric hookup whilst on steps it would not keep meat frozen. We returned to San Francisco across Dumbarton Bridge and could not pay online because we did not have a US zip code (being British) So despite advising Indie that we would pay the $7 toll we were charged $27.00 and told that was how they did it! Despite a long and detailed report on the very many difficulties we had experienced to Customer (dis) Service we were only offered a 10% credit (despite our request for 20% and at the time of our complaint Indie were offering greater than that as a discount for new bookings!!) We did receive a credit for the cost of the chemical tabs and dish towels they had not provided. All these difficulties ruined our much anticipated holiday, not only with the significant discomfort we suffered but also the time spent trying to resolve these many issues. We could never advise anyone to hire from Indie.",1
"Don't believe the marketing hype. They're a tech powered, venture capital driven money making machine.","I had a very poor experience, my impression is they have one objective: to extract as much money from their customers as possible.

Two weeks after my rental ended they took $375 from my credit card account. I contacted them immediately. Apparently, I'd requested the premium insurance at check-in, and they'd 'forgotten' to charge me. 'Fortunately', their online check-in was broken and so I'd checked in through their online chat function, the transcript of which proved conclusively.

You might think they'd be apologetic? No, within 2 hours of raising the issue (now three weeks after my rental ended) they were able to rustle up a ludicrous and fabricated damage report. (See the pictures). Although it was convincing at first.

After sourcing better images, it was obvious they were attempting to charge me almost $700 for a reflection in the paintwork. Google Street View showed it was clearly of the building opposite.

Interestingly the damage report also specified that the damage (reflection) was down to the primer.

What do I infer from this?

* damage reports are produced without a physical inspection of the vehicle
* they're not on your side
* you could easily be charged for non-existent damage
* the depot staff have zero say in the process. They might tell you everything is OK, but it's not their call
* pay with a good credit card so you can do a charge back.

Eventually, I got all my money back but it was a massive hassle and stressful. I was lucky because the damage report they sent me was so ludicrous and I had transcripts to back up my claims. If they'd cropped the 'damage' pictures more closely, and been a little more conservative in their claims it could easily have turned out differently.",1
Stay away from this company,"They stay away from this company, completely without any concerns with the customer, unfortunately I did not check the reviews before here, if they had read before the comments would never have been related to this company, they rent this car caravan on other random sites for 1 euros for you to work for them and take the vehicle to another city, but they can not deliver the vehicle to you 6000 euros because of lack of organizational capacity of the company that enslaves an employee (which by the way has no fault and the company was not very helpful) that they alone have to do all the functions of the company, this sad reality in full year 2025 in Europe, without any storage structure of the vehicles, then they put the vehicles in rustic terrain without having any interest, so they have been able to get me a solution, then they would try to get no money in the price of transportation, they will get the same way, they will avoid the solution that is not a compromise that the vehicles are left with",1
I wouldn't hire Indie Camper again.,"Very bad experience with the company. Unclarified service charges appeared. The vehicle covers were not in condition. And the staff was poor.
I wouldn't hire this company again.",1
!!!DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH INDIE CAMPERS!!! COMPLETE SCAMMERS!!!,"!!!DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH INDIE CAMPERS!!!

!!!They are complete cons and will scam you out of everything!!!

This company is an absolute disgrace. My friend and I booked a large camper van through Indie Campers for a road trip from Cairns to Melbourne. It was supposed to have two double beds, a bathroom, and a kitchen—perfect for our trip. But when we arrived, they pulled the first con. They told us they didn’t have the van we booked and forced us to take a 4WD ute with a rooftop tent instead. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! A tiny ute with a tent doesn’t even come CLOSE to what we paid for.

This downgrade completely ruined our trip. No space, no comfort, no bathroom, no kitchen—just a cramped and miserable experience. We couldn’t even complete the trip as planned because it was so unbearable. We had to cut the trip short and come home early from Brisbane. What should have been an amazing experience turned into an absolute nightmare thanks to Indie Campers.

To make matters worse, this company has ZERO communication. They refuse to talk to you on the phone, dodge questions, and avoid giving straight answers at all costs. If you try to get clarity or even discuss your concerns, you’ll be met with vague emails or total silence. It’s beyond frustrating and downright unprofessional.

And just when we thought it was over, two weeks after returning the vehicle, they have the audacity to try and charge us over $4,000 for a tiny dent! A DENT TWO WEEKS after we handed back the car, they suddenly “discover” damage? This is beyond shady—this is a blatant money-grab. There’s no way to prove when or how that dent happened, and it reeks of a scam.

Indie Campers is the WORST company I have ever dealt with. They don’t honour bookings, they lie to your face, they give you inferior vehicles, and then they have the nerve to try and rip you off even more after the fact.

DO NOT BOOK WITH THESE SCAMMERS. They will ruin your trip, take your money, refuse to communicate, and then try to take even more. I wouldn’t trust Indie Campers with a bike, let alone a camper van. Stay far, FAR away!",1
SEWERAGE LEAKED FOR 4 DAYS,"SEWERAGE LEAKED FOR 4 DAYS, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Indie Campers SF did nothing to solve the situation and offered us partial refund that didn’t come close to covering our additional expenses. RV was generally in very poor condition. They ruined our Great American RV Experience we had planned for a year.
-       Toilet broken and taped together (photos)
-       Toilet structure full of old urine and sewerage (photos)
-       Cabin smelt constantly like a sewer, unfit for sleeping in
-       Leak old sewerage into cabin every time you drove
-       Lied to by staff, told black water empty, it wasn’t and poured into cabin
-       Main window leaked rain water onto bed making it unusable as an RV (photos)
-       Filthy exterior and windscreen
-       Interior poorly cleaned, pubic hair in sink, skid marks in toilet
-       Sheets rented for $80 each had holes in them
-       Chairs rented were filthy
-       Kitchen set inadequate for being self sufficient
Indie has no solution saying they were unable to deliver replacement. We paid for additional emergency accommodation and forfeited the RV park fees, paid for cleaning products, additional black water emptying and then had to clean up old sewerage 15 times over 4 days.  Indie took over 72hrs to respond. Partial refund given after daily messages and complaints for over a week didn’t come close to covering our additional costs, let alone holiday disruption and general trauma of cleaning up other people sewerage all day.  They are the worst company I have ever dealt with. There are other options out there, please use them! They don’t give a stuff about their customers and their vehicles are dangerously and disgustingly substandard.",1
A Disastrous Experience with Indie Campers – Think Twice Before Booking!,"I booked with Indie Campers for what was meant to be a dream trip in Brisbane, but their actions turned it into a stressful experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I feel it’s important to share my story to warn others.

I reserved a Jeep Wrangler 8 months in advance, carefully selecting this vehicle for its off-road capabilities, which were essential for the destinations I planned to visit. Just 5 days before my trip, I was notified that my reservation was being replaced with a Trekker model, a vehicle that does not meet the standards or functionality of what I had paid for. This change was made without my consent, leaving me no time to arrange alternatives.

This substitution forced me to cancel parts of my itinerary and compromise on activities that were central to my trip. What should have been a seamless and exciting experience turned into an ordeal of frustration and stress. Despite reaching out to their customer service team multiple times, I received no meaningful resolution or compensation for the significant inconvenience and financial losses caused by their decision.

I have reported this issue to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and to the Queensland government’s consumer complaints body, as I believe it’s vital to hold companies accountable when they fail to deliver on their promises. Additionally, I have raised this matter with my lawyer, who will be pursuing this further. Consumers have a right to expect what they pay for, especially when they book months in advance.

If you’re considering using Indie Campers, I strongly urge you to rethink your choice. My experience has shown me that they cannot be trusted to honor their commitments, and their customer service has failed to provide solutions in moments when they matter most.

I hope my review encourages others to explore more reliable alternatives. A company like Indie Campers, which can so easily disrupt customers’ plans without adequate resolution, is not one I would ever recommend.",1
TERRIBLE,The WORST experience with a rental. Overcharged with no refund for overage they snuck in. Terrible customer service. Dirty offices. We should have known from the first interaction.,1
Unbelievable - Do not rent under any circumstances,"I very rarely give bad reviews, but at Indie Campers I have no choice but to warn every potential customer.

We rented a camper from 26.12.24 to 06.01.25 and made and from the standpoint of Düsseldorf into the Black Forest. Luckily we were able to make a stopover at a friend's house to wash the totally dirty and incomplete kitchen kit. After only 300KM the AdBlue started immediately, which according to the employee should only start after 500-600KM - which did not bother us much, because we had to fill it continuously anyway. But then it really started. On the first evening in the camper we found that the privacy screen is torn for darkening and not raking in. So there was no way to black out the van. We were then recommended on Thursday evening to come back to Düsseldorf on Monday, which would have shortened our trip by 4 days and of course is absolutely unacceptable. And so it went on in one tour.

Here is a list of all the inconveniences:
1. The bed sheet of the booked essential kit was missing.
2. The kitchen utensils were so dirty that we had to clean them first.
3. The kitchen set lacked a spatula to turn meat or eggs as well as the salad bowl.
4. Two of the 4 plastic jars were torn on all sides, so the liquid just flowed out.
5. The storage space under the dining table was dirty and had to be cleaned by us before use.
6. At the bottom drawer in the kitchenette, the lock is broken, so it opens when you corner. We had to tape them every day so we could drive safely. With a frightening driver, this can lead to a bad accident!
7. The replacement gas cylinder was empty, although we were told it was full and when the first cylinder was empty we had to take a rather large detour in the Black Forest to buy two new cylinders.
8. Shortly after driving off, the AdBlue lamp was already lit and we had to refill directly, not after 500KM as we said.
9. The window in the bathroom could not be detected and ventilation was so difficult in the bathroom.
10. The privacy screen for blacking out on the driver's side lacks a small knob in the axle, which means that we had to re-clamp it daily.
11. The privacy screen for darkening on the sliding door lacked the snap-in function, so darkening was not possible. In addition, the privacy screen is torn on both sides over a good 10cm and also the guide rail is not firmly anchored in the door (screw cannot be tightened, hole used).
12. On a few days, the upper center console between the driver and the passenger drew water and it started to drip.
13. In the second part of the journey, the front light in the bed area began to flicker. There's probably condensation in it. The result was a complete loss of control, so the light was always on when power was active in the van.

The daily resetting and fixing of the privacy screen, gluing of the drawer, the always burning light and all the other points have severely restricted the quality of our holiday and is absolutely unacceptable to us.

The ongoing support conversation is also unbelievable.

Better find another place to rent a camper and save yourself the hassle.",1
A challenging time which was not a nice one,We arrived after a long journey my partner and i after working long hours all year.to an awful car parpark and saw the motorhome which looked unclean and not like wed expected .i asked for an upgrade but was told no.my partner and myself had rented the van for five nights and were excited to go to tiede.we were told it would have heating and hot water .when we arrived we were told the boiler was broken and no heating no hot water.Five days no washing and feeling unclean and froze at tiede with no heating minus ten degrees.It was an extremely challenging experience After returning home im still recovering from a terrible cough for nearly three weeks from this experience.We complained and they refunded us80euos.Never again!!!!,1
"AWFUL experience, please use another company!!","AWFUL COMPANY. Totally take advantage of their customers.
So much money for such an appalling service.
Complete lack of communication and a refusal to compensate us for our issues.
We paid over €6000 for 2-3 weeks for a camper & we received no gas bottle or adblue , a full grey water tank that stank and a very smelly toilet. We also paid extra for a bedding kit which was of such poor quality we may as well not of had a pillow & IT HAD OTHER PEOPLES BLOOD on it.
Please please use a different company!!!!!!!",1
NEVER rent an Indie Camper,"One of the worst experiences ever. I'll make it short and pointless.
_ An error has occurred. An additional $1,200 was charged to us. After 3 months of exchange, Indie Camper never wanted to refund us, stipulating that we had not taken the insurance refund or exchange.
_ Unclean premises.
_ Very dirty camping. VERY DIRTY. Several pieces of waste from former tenants.
_ Tyre in very bad condition.
_ Key about to die
_ Poor crockery kit.
_ Lights burned.
_ Smells of the shower
_ Mold in the refrigerator and freezer",1
AVOID Indie Camper!,"I strongly advise against renting from Indie Camper based on my recent experience. From the outset, the process was fraught with hidden fees that significantly increased the overall cost of the rental. Upon receiving the van, I was dismayed to find it in poor condition. The interior showed signs of neglect: the chairs were broken, and several electrical components, including the outlets, were non-functional. Additionally, essential items like bed sheets were overpriced, adding unnecessary expenses to our trip.

The most troubling aspect of our rental was the abysmal customer service. Communication with Indie Camper was a nightmare; each time we reached out, we were connected to a different agent who seemed unaware of our previous interactions. This lack of consistency led to repetitive questioning and a frustrating runaround without any resolution. We encountered conflicting information regarding simple requests, such as adjusting the pick-up time, which further complicated our plans and diminished our overall experience.

Overall, Indie Camper failed to meet basic standards of vehicle maintenance and customer support. Their hidden fees, subpar van condition, and unreliable customer service make them an unsuitable choice for anyone seeking a hassle-free camper rental. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for others considering Indie Camper for their travel needs.",1
DISHONESTY,"DISHONESTY

We booked on indiecampers Portugal without reading reviews, and it was a great mistake,
Attention they are thieves, we wanted to spend a few days with family and even if the rental was expensive we made an effort for the holidays and see Portugal in van.
To our surprise on arrival, we were informed that the gas bottle was not included, 39 euros for a small gas bottle, we did not pay attention but the gas bottle was empty and after 2 days more gas, it was not a cool feeling to have paid for something and not received it, the water heater system had a problem with the sensor, you had to leave the window open to take a shower,
adéblue empty after 200k.
I tried to make a claim to the company, and he tells me that I did not take a bottle of gas, that in my bill the extra I had paid was laundry, I explain to them that no, but he did not want to know anything.
In the end, the cheapest in the search, but after all the extras and feelings of being stolen, I advise you to look for another company to rent your van,",1
DO NOT USE!!! SCAMMERS,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! SCAMMERS!
We had a lovely time and everything seemed really easy to book in and the staff were really lovely and helpful (so we thought). We dropped the van off and they inspected it and told us that it was all fine. I then get an email a week after dropping it off to say the van was damaged and they took 377.83CHF out of our account!!! We had photos sent through of a very minor scratch on the side of the roof (which we didn’t do!) and won’t send us proof of when the photos were taken. We emailed to complain and the response was “you signed a contract that states we can claim for any damages to the vehicle 30 days after you drop it off” disgraceful company will never use again!!!",1
"THE WORST, MOST FRAUDULENT COMPANY - DO NOT USE","THE WORST, MOST FRAUDULENT COMPANY WE HAVE EVER INTERACTED WITH. The company hit us with tons of hidden fees, sent us on the road with a vehicle that was worn out, then the bumper FELL OFF the RV on a major highway, endangering our family and other motorists -- and the company charged us thousands of dollars because they said we had an accident. Their customer service is inept, rude, and incredibly difficult to reach. Their representatives are dishonest -- for example charging us for a propane tank that should have been included in the rental. NEVER USE THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL REGRET IT",1
Nightmare,"We had problems with the provision of bail. Our credit card didn't have enough cover. The employee (big, fat and unfriendly) refused to help us. So we asked him if we could use another credit card from friends and family he blocked and put us out the door without handing over the key to the van. With luggage and in scorching heat we walked 30min into town to find a hotel by being able to stay. We were very depressed and sad and called the indiecamper support hotline who recommended us to just use another credit card (!!!). We then deposited the deposit by phone and the next day in the afternoon we went back to the van rental, where the unfriendly employee received us. No apology, no comment on his misjudgment, and a put-upon, friendly behavior, as if we hadn't lost much time, money, and nerve to his ignorance and incompetence. Never again indie campers",1
Indie Campers – Fraud and Abandonment of Customers in Need,"Here I share our disastrous experience with Indie Campers on our van rental in Iceland. Not only did we face fraudulent practices after restitution, but we also faced a total lack of support in an emergency. Details of our journey are as follows:

1. Problems with mountain assistance
During our trip, we encountered a breakdown with the van in the middle of the mountain, in difficult climatic conditions. Despite our multiple attempts to reach Indie Campers, we had to wait more than 8 hours for an answer. This unacceptable wait not only put our safety at risk, but also caused significant delays in our journey.

Faced with their total lack of assistance, we were forced:

To pay ourselves a taxi (€680) to reach the nearest town.
To use an external tow truck, again at our expense.
This is an inexcusable situation for a company that claims to offer 24/7 support. This is clearly a failure to assist anyone in difficulty, which is not only contrary to their contractual commitments, but also deeply irresponsible.

2. Fraudulent claim for non-existent damages
Once back in France, we received an email from Indie Campers claiming € 1074,52 for ""damages"" allegedly discovered after the return of the vehicle. This claim is totally unjustified for several reasons:

During the check-out, the condition of the van was confirmed as impeccable. The agency representative thoroughly inspected the vehicle, took photos, and signed a document attesting that everything was in perfect condition. She even assured us that our 2000€ deposit would be refunded within 10 to 20 days.
We were not informed of the need to take photos on the way back. Having been reassured by the staff of the agency, we did not find it useful to take additional photos. This shows their clear intention to take advantage of the situation.
A week later, Indie Campers suddenly informs us of this fictional ""damage"", a practice we consider fraudulent and dishonest.

3. Non-existent customer service
Since then, we have attempted to contact their customer service to clarify the situation. However:

No consideration for the evidence and arguments we have presented.
A threatening attitude, informing us that our deposit of 2000€ would be withheld if we did not immediately pay this unjustified sum.
Conclusion
Indie Campers is not a trustworthy company. The following is a summary of the harm we have suffered:

Exorbitant personal expenses (€680) due to their lack of assistance.
Attempted fraud with a claim for fictitious damages.
Stress, wasted time, and feelings of total injustice.
I would strongly recommend against Indie Campers for all travellers. If you care about your safety, your time and your money, go your way and choose a more reliable and honest company.

Recommendation:
Avoid Indie Campers at all costs and share your experience to protect other travelers from their fraudulent practices.",1
SCAMMERS! NOT RENT IN INDIE CAMPERS,"We rented a camper for 10 days and unfortunately we scratched it. Aware of them we were willing to pay the damage despite taking out insurance with themselves, which served no purpose because they claimed it did not cover the scratch area. Despite this, we wanted to pay for the detail an amount but indie campers quoted us damages for 1300€ that we would be charged from the prepaid warranty. We could do little because we had already delivered the warranty. We told them that we found abusive, unfair and arbitrary the amount they delivered to us and gave us the answer ""they are the prices and policies of the company"", without giving us alternatives.

In addition to Indie Camper Milan staff, they are edges and rude. We were with a 1-year-old baby and we were held for more than 2 hours pending the quotation of damages.

Bad experience. DO NOT RENT!",1
Avoid Indie Campers at all costs.,Even the booking process was confusing and it seems like the booking process could be very easily open to scammers to take advantage of it. The help received from indie campers was useless and actually made me feel quite panicked. Avoid indie campers at all costs,1
Bad support/ bad Advertising,Dont belevie a thing. The vans are not what they advertise. And the support is crab. We booked a wrangler with rooftop Tent. The Tent is waaaay smaller than on Pictures and Videos. Don't expect IndieCamper to help you out or Refund you.,1
Stay away from indie campers.,Hello we have experienced the same problems and are now battling indie campers. We hired the van in Napoli and the lady on site was fantastic. We then headed toward Sicily we camped about 2 hours away from Napoli on the first night and the battery was dead and would not charge. There customer service was no help so we went back to Napoli the next morning where I helped the lady switch the battery as it was dead and could hold charge. When we finished our 12 day holiday (minus the day and travel we lost) we returned the van to Naples in what we thought was good shape. Our premium insurance was meant to cover any thing above the bottom of the door but they are claiming we dinted the door and it’s not covered (the door is just grime). They also claimed we scratched the camper to the primer and it was just road grime as well. They want to charge us 1100 euros the funny thing is we paid an extra hidden cost for the after drop off clean which they haven’t done. They are obviously just looking at photos and making this up as the lady at the site said it was all good. They have now gone silent with no response as I had a photo of the grime being cleaned off. (2 photos of are the so called damages and the other 2 are of after I cleaned the black mark of with my fingers),1
Avoid this company at all costs,"Complete frauds and scammers. Do not ever book with this company.

We booked a van 6 months in advance with two double beds and two days before our departure, they switched us to a van with only one bed and offered us an $80 refund. They had already tried to do this once, five days before our booking and we said it was unacceptable. So they said they would give us the van we originally booked but two days later, we received another automated email saying that we again had been swapped to an inferior van with one bed again.

It has ruined a holiday we have had booked for six months and when you call the help line, they say they can't help. Their live chat provides no assistance either.

Book with any other company if you don't want to be scammed.",1
"Fraudsters, a mob internationally, don't rent with them","I've had a terrible experience with Indie Campers: a brazen scam.

Rent a Carado motorhome with Indie Campers for 4 days has been one of the worst decisions and experiences I have had in this type of services. I have been charged an outrageous €1,673 alleging damage to the side door of the motorhome (a simple bun under 10 cm), something totally disproportionate and unjustified. Most outrageously, the damage was not even caused by me, as I explained repeatedly and in detail.

The company's response has been absolutely unacceptable. They hide behind their “company policy” like a robot, showing a total disinterest in listening to or solving the real problems of their customers. They don't care about the truth, the client, or any reasonable argument. Even when the damage was clearly caused by third parties, they make no effort to investigate or understand the situation.

It is evident that Indie Campers is a regular practice to collect deposits at the slightest excuse, regardless of fairness or customer experience. My big mistake was not to have reviewed the numerous negative comments about this company on the Internet before, which seem to confirm a repeated pattern of scams and abuses.

In addition, the service is poor in every way: the company is clearly poorly managed, its staff is unqualified and customer service is absent. They treat you with indifference and show no professionalism or empathy.

Please don't trust Indie Campers. If you don’t want to go through the same bitter experience, look for more serious and responsible alternatives. Here they will only encounter abuse, neglect and unworthy service.",1
Fraudsters,"Be careful, rent with other companies! Bad experience bordering on scam.
Indie Campers carries out MISLEADING ADVERTISING. The beautiful van is new that you see in the photos does not exist, for you there will be a patched van, which if you are good you will be able to use if you but badly makes you lose days of travel around mechanics.
Our van ACTIVE had to have swivel seats to be able to eat inside the van. The seats didn't turn, despite the fact that the photos and online description said so. We brought it up to service but they told us to go to a mechanic to make sure of this...
Also the sewage pipe was broken, this meant that when the van was moving there was a vomiting smell all over the van. The shower water because of this problem went down from the van and not into the black water. So the shower was unusable if you didn't want to risk a fine!
Our journey lasted two weeks and during this time the assistance was not helpful indeed, first they made us lose a day to make us go to the mechanic and attest that it was really as we said... and then keep the van exactly as it was.
In addition to the discomfort these problems made us spend more than expected, we had to make much less free stop and go to campsites to wash and to be able to eat with a table outside.
The only refund we got was a ridiculous 50 euros for “the repair costs. While we who rent have to compensate everything, they can compensate a maximum of 50 euros even if they rent you a non-working van (paid top dollar!!!)",1
DO NOT rent from Indie! Unjustly charged $2700 and a broken camper!,"We will NEVER rent from Indie again. This company is a total scam! Do NOT give them your credit card details! We rented a camper for 3 weeks in the US (Phoenix-Phoenix) and paid an amount of $3500.

On day 2, we camped without hookups for the first time (common in US national parks). We woke up in the middle of the night, in the dark and freezing cold (below zero), to various beeps and alarms. Indie only has a WhatsApp number, no phone number to call. We asked for help but got no adequate advice. We concluded ourselves that the battery must be dead (even though we hadn’t used anything that night to conserve battery), and Indie’s advice was to have it repaired at an RV repair shop. We followed this advice, but it cost us half a day, and we had to pay $266.17 out of pocket. Indie later reimbursed this amount.

On day 12, we encountered more problems: the right rear tire showed an alarm indicating a problem, and upon inspection, it appeared there were missing parts on the valve (unlike the other tires). We contacted Indie, and their advice was again to go to a tire shop. However, it was Thanksgiving, so this wasn’t possible.

On day 13, we discovered that our grey water tank was completely loose, meaning we were leaking grey water wherever we went while showering, washing dishes, etc. The tank was hanging loose underneath—dangerous! Upon inspection, we found that this wasn’t new damage; it had previously been patched with duct tape! When we contacted Indie, they tried to blame us for the issue, claiming that we caused the damage, even though we had proof that the dent on the side of the camper was already there when we picked it up. Additionally, the sink drain was completely loose, causing the bathroom sink to leak water all over the floor instead of draining properly. Indie advised us to drive to a depot in San Francisco or Los Angeles. However, we were far from these locations, and we didn’t have enough miles to travel that far. Our itinerary didn’t include these cities, but we decided to deviate from our plan and drove from Sequoia National Park to San Francisco. When we arrived on the weekend, the depot was closed, and the swap could only happen on Monday. After a day of waiting and numerous follow-up contacts, we were finally told we could swap. Indie then told us over the phone that we needed to pay another deposit of $2100. We refused, as we already had a deposit on our credit card for the first camper. The depot didn’t ask for another deposit, as the first one was already reserved.

On day 19, we discovered that the reservation for the deposit on our credit card had been converted into a full charge of $2700, with no prior notice. We contacted Indie several times, but they only agreed to ""refund"" the amount once we returned the camper. We explained that a deposit should be a reservation, not a charge.

For our swap, we repeatedly told Indie not to charge us for extra miles. However, in our new rental contract, Indie allotted us 700 miles (6 days x 125 miles) for the return drive from San Francisco to Phoenix. This was impossible, even with the shortest route. We repeatedly pointed this out and received vague responses. Eventually, we were told not to worry because Indie would add the miles from Sequoia to San Francisco and back as a ""detour"" to our total mileage.

After 3 weeks, we returned the camper in spotless condition, without any damage, and with all tanks full and emptied as required. However, we still have not received our deposit back. Furthermore, $329.77 was suddenly charged for ""additional miles,"" with no explanation, even though Indie had previously promised not to charge us for the detour miles.

We are desperate! We’ve lost an additional $2700 (on top of the $3500 for the camper) and have no idea how to get this money back. Our vacation was filled with misfortune, extra time, and money wasted on this camper. We tried to inform our credit card company to stop Indie from charging us, but this is apparently not possible. Once you give someone access to your credit card, they can charge whatever they want, and Indie takes full advantage of this.

Note: We have extensive evidence of all the damages and communications.",1
Dire experience in Iceland,"Dire experience with Indie Campers Iceland, I don’t usually write very bad opinions and less as long as I will relate.
On the day of pickup the van we were offered had a heating breakdown (and we talked about Iceland in December) so we asked for change, it took almost three hours to give us another so we lost the first day of vacation. They don’t warn you that the gas bottle for heating at night only lasts one night, worth the redundancy, which is almost €60 bottle per night (for that and the daily price of the van you go to cabins or hotels and rent a stroller). If you have a problem the 24-hour support phone does not work (at least at night), as we burst a wheel at eleven o’clock at night and had to call 112, total of the joke more than 600€ of repair that we had to pay in advance (and that we contracted Premium service). We'll see if the insurance takes over and we get our money back. From an outside window a small corner was broken, which can be fixed with a little adhesive and they want to charge us whole (200€ which is the franchise because according to them it costs 1000 and I peak the repair). Also if there are two double beds and you ask for two bed services, because you suppose it is one for each, it turns out that when you go to pick up the caravan you are asked how many people go and if there are four people they charge you two more services because they are per person not per bed, although when you assemble it turns out that there are only two sets of sheets and duvets and four single pillows that must be what you are charged.
I add that when we picked it up, the three people I had returned were claiming and when we went to return it to two people and each of them also claiming.
Anyway a dire experience",1
BRISBANE OFFICE IS TERRIBLE,"Indiecampers’ Brisbane rental office was an awful experience.

First, the guy checking me forgot to give me a gray water hose AND show me how to empty the toilet cassette, which resulted in me having to dump my water into a drain on the side of the street which is not ideal for the environment.

The check in guy also said that when I drop it off, we can then check how many KM’s I drove and switch to the pre-paid plan if I went over the free plan, “or whichever one is cheaper to help you out”. Then at drop off, he wasn’t actually there and someone said I had to pay the pre paid, higher price no matter what. So he falsely advertised to me at check in.

I had a minor parking accident and dented the side of the van slightly, and at drop off I was honest about it. The guy told me they would run it through the local repair shop to get a quote so that it would be cheaper for me, instead of going through main Indiecampers which would overcharge me for sure.

I get my full security deposit back, but then a week later they charge my credit card $5,000 USD for the 2 minor repairs from my dent.

This is the most negligible, illegitimate, and unfair charge I’ve ever seen with any car rental company. I’m actually appalled at the way their customer service said they would “do the right thing” only for them to go and charge me a completely fake number just to get my money.

I will be using my credit card’s rental car insurance to file a claim and unlawful charges for this. This is absolutely obscene and I would not recommend using Indiecampers to anyone.",1
Terrible experience,"Indie campers was a terrible experience. I got a leaky bus in Iceland, it was raining in all the time. The sheets I had to pay extra were moldy in advance. I had to stay overnight twice out of necessity because I couldn't keep anything completely dry anymore. Afterwards, they just put “problem solved” behind my complaint. So nothing was ever done, despite photos, control of the persons there (who agreed with my story) and a detailed description of what was going on. The customer service is so poorly structured that there is no main office or central point that you can reach, so you always have others on the line every time you dial in for something. The staff on site also only work with the same system. Which gives a lot of ambiguity and frustration and therefore you are not really helped if something is really going on.",1
"Bad experience, worse customer service","We rented a Four Wind camper for 12 days in California.

PRO: easy to use website and booking
CON: bad commodities, sketchy prices, bad customer support

---- full review

We rented an RV for four people, with wetsuits and surfboards. When we arrived, they told us they were out of wetsuits, and so they proposed to remove the surfboards as well, with a refund after the check-out date. We agreed as wetsuits and surfboards are kind of a bundle.
After the rental was completed, they told us *we* decided to remove the surfboard and thus we couldn't be eligible for the refund.
0/5⭐

Aside from that, the RV had minimal (too minimal) commodities. We paid for the ""essential kit"" and we got 2 pillows and 1 blanket. And we were 4 people!
The cookware was worse than a student's kitchenware. They provided 1 small pot and 1 small pan. Couldn't even make a pasta for 2. Not even a decent knife. We had to spend 2 hours and 200$ to buy missing blankets and cookware at Walmart. Not fun when you just spent 3000$ for a camper.
1/5⭐

Adding 1 star because the desk guys were friendly.
2/5⭐

I tried to solve things by writing the customer care but they were rude and ignored my request.

Next time we'll use Roadsurfer or a similar service.",2
BAD EXPERIENCE BORDERING ON THE SCAM,"The worst rental experience I've ever had. I will never rent a vehicle with INDIE CAMPERS again and strongly advise against anyone doing so. They have proved to be unfair and dishonest since the beginning of the rental.

The van was delivered to us 3 hours late, changing the vehicle directly on site without warning. Shortly after leaving the pick-up location, we ran out of diesel, without even time to reach a gas station. We had to call a tow truck and pay for it, despite the 24h assistance, expense that was reimbursed only after some time. After two days, the vehicle's AdBlue also ran out and we had to refuel at our expense, despite being guaranteed it would last for the entire holiday.

The worst thing was the charge of 1209.03€ for a small dent at the top of the camper, not covered by insurance. They showed us photos without date or time and withdrew the amount from the card without notifying us, soliciting several times a further payment. And this despite the fact that we had taken out premium insurance.

Finally, today I received an email from INTRUM, a Portuguese company, who contacted me through INDIE CAMPERS to collect an additional €613.40 credit. I'm guessing it's a fraud for all intents and purposes.

I hope this terrible experience of mine will help anyone thinking of renting a campervan with this company, to prevent a pleasant holiday from turning into a real nightmare and a cheap bloodletting.",1

Indie Campervans are an unreliable service amd should be avoided as a campervan rental.,"Indie-competent, “New Zealand’s South Island franchise to be avoided.”.

Recently we traveled to Christchurch, New Zealand to rent an Indie Poptop Camper for a five day tour of the South Island, albeit a compressed time to visit an area so packed with places to see. We shuttled to the Christchurch office and met with Phil who checked us in and gave us a short explanation of the camper van we were to use. He mentioned there would be an oil light on but not to worry, maintenance was scheduled when we returned the van in six days. It was our first red flag.

Excited for our adventure we drove off and headed toward Mount Cook. As we pulled out noticing the oil light lit as warned, we also noticed we only had a quarter tank of gas, an added red flag. We pressed on but noticed the camper van struggled anytime we needed to climb. We didn’t think much about it and arrived at our first nights stop. The next morning as we made the turn to Mt Cook and more climbing the engine light came on. We now had a the oil light, engine light and an obviously compromised vehicle moving slowly uphill. We attempted to contact Indie through the Q code as instructed but we did not have strong enough cell service to go through the steps. We decided to change our plans and divert to Queenstown where we knew they had an office. We arrived at noon and spent hours trying to get help from Indie. At one point they sent us a list of local garages to take the van to the following day. The vehicle wasn’t safe to drive farther so we had to sleep in the parking ones the Queenstown Events Center and drive in the morning to their office as instructed.

We arrived at the office the following day at 9am and no one was there. We contacted Indie again and they said they’d work on it. Fortunately at 9:30am the manager Shane arrived but had no notice we were coming for help. He was helpful but it wasn’t until almost noon that he was able to exchanged vans for us. We were also charged a second bond on the van and they said they couldn’t refund the previous one until we completed the trip. It made no sense to us but we just wanted to get on the road so we paid it.

We were upset we had lost more than a day with van issues but decided to be positive and create an abbreviated plan. We headed for Milford Sound. The new van was exactly what we had hoped for, it climbed easily and we were reassured from this that the previous van was compromised from the time we left Christchurch.

We visited Milford Sound and found a campsite just outside of it surrounded by snow capped mountains and cold air—-we had a hail storm as we checked into the campground. Once we parked we planned our evening of heating the water, cooking our dinner from the groceries we picked up and going to bed after a frustrating couple of days. Unfortunately, Shane had forgotten to change the empty LP gas tank so we had no hot water, gas grill or hot water. It’s hard to describe how disappointed we became at that moment.

That evening we ate peanut butter sandwiches, took a cold sink cleanse and tried to stay warm that night. In the morning the temperature in the van read 7 degrees. Our fourth night continued our focus on discussing the ineptitude of Indie Campervans. We only had five nights scheduled and what we expected to be an exciting trip was marred by the constant problems presented by Indie Campervans. .

The next morning we drove out of the park, headed back toward Christchurch for our fifth night. We found a place to exchange our empty LP gas so we would have the amenities we expected every night. The van was due back by 11am so we had a full day of driving so we could arrive on time.

We believe the people we worked with at Indie at good intentions but low competency. We were first given a van that was obviously compromised mechanically as recognized when we were told to ignore the oil light as it was scheduled for service the following week. The second van wasn’t prepared properly and we suffered for that too. In summary, Indie Campervans of South Island New Zealand lack competency and because of that our trip was significantly compromised. We are extremely disappointed.",1
DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!,"ICELAND Indiecamper: This company scams and lies to their customers and rips them off 1000 Euros. Let's start with the check in, where the staff were trying to make you pay for as many extras as possible but leave out the important information. We had the van booked for 5 days which means that only 500 km (100km/day) are included for free. When we were doing the check in we told the staff member that we'll be doing the ring route (1400km), and she, if she would have been a competent and well trained employee, would have told us about the opportunity to ""only"" pay an extra 300 for unlimited kilometers. But of course she DID NOT tell us about it because she knew that we well end up paying an extra 600. At the check out we were obviously shocked when the staff member said we have to pay an additional 600€ BUT we will definitely get the difference between of 300€ back since the check in member should have informed us about this. He even told us where to make the claim. Well he just wanted to get us out of the way because we didn't get anything back. Now 2 weeks after our trip we all of the sudden got charged 1000€!!! on our credit card for a minor damage (a hard plastic part broke). After asking them for a proper cost analysis an invoice they're not responding anymore. They just want your money and when you email them you just get automatic emails with the t&c's you agreed on when signing the contract. All in one it's a LEGAL SCAM and they rip you of as much as they can. I definitely would not recommend dealing with these camper van rentals ever again as they are very dishonest and scam you for ridiculous costs that are absolutely outrageous!!! DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

I rented a camper for them for a week. Tons of fees before checkout, but hey, that’s the American way right?

The reason I will NEVER rent from them is that they rented us a camper without the chairs and table in the back. When I asked the person who rented it to us, they said, “we don’t have any available, don’t worry you won’t be charged.” God I wish I had that in writing!! They came back after we dropped off the van and charged me 600(!) dollars for the table and 300(!) for the table!!! Then they blamed us for a loose bumper that we hadn’t touched and charged us ANOTHER 140(!) to simply click it back into place. INSANE. UNETHICAL. BORDERLINE CRIMINAL.",1

WARNING: NEVER RENT FROM INDIE CAMPERS!!!! SCAM + EXCESSIVE CHARGES,"WARNING: NEVER RENT FROM INDIE CAMPERS!!!! SCAM + EXCESSIVE CHARGES

EXCESSIVE FEES:
When returning the vehicle, we were charged €2,500 for a tiny dent, barely visible and for which we are not at all responsible! We didn’t dent the van during our trip, so only two explanations are possible. First, the dent may have been there from the beginning. We didn’t get a check-in, and we arrived at night on a dark parking lot, making it nearly impossible to see any damage (we have photo evidence). When we returned the van, it was covered in dust and mud, which would have made any inspection even harder. Or, someone may have grazed it in a parking lot. In either case, we are not responsible! Even if we were (which we are not), the amount they charged is outrageous for such a minor ""damage,"" especially given the state of the van and the other vans on the lot—they clearly never repair the bodywork! It seems like a scheme to make you pay for their overpriced insurance, which, according to many people, doesn’t even work! You can search online; I am far from the only person who has experienced this, as there are many complaints on subreddits, Facebook groups, and TrustPilot reviews! I wasn’t aware of this beforehand, so please don’t fall victim to this fraudulent company as we did! Indie Campers’ practices are called out in multiple countries. I will probably join one of the movements against this company, which scams its customers!
No check-in process: We collected the van at night on a dark parking lot with no guidance. It was impossible to confirm the initial condition of the vehicle, and no check-in confirmation was provided.
Engine oil pressure light: The ""engine oil pressure"" warning light came on very frequently. We were told it was nothing to worry about, but the problem persisted throughout the trip.
Empty gas bottles: Although the staff assured us that a gas bottle would be available (only charged if opened), we found two bottles... both empty, leaving us unable to cook on the first night.
Battery issues: The van battery was only charged to 30% when we received the vehicle. Furthermore, the battery and water indicators were faulty.
No igniter for the stove: The stove had no igniter, and no lighter or matches were provided, so we couldn’t cook the first evening.
Heating and hot water malfunctions: The heater would shut off spontaneously after a few hours, meaning we had to spend every night in the cold. The water heater worked intermittently, forcing us to take cold showers at times.
Unacceptable cleanliness: Upon arrival, the floor of the van was in terrible condition, with large, dirty stains all over (we have photo evidence). The interior also smelled terrible, like a sewer.
Damaged window blinds: Half of the window blinds were either torn or non-functional, making it impossible to sleep past dawn.
Gas leak: We were advised never to use the gas with the trunk closed. We soon realized why—there was actually a gas leak. Every time we opened the gas bottle to cook, the smell of gas quickly filled the cabin, which is a serious safety hazard. Having to cook with the trunk open in 10-degree weather was far from ideal!
Leaking fridge: The van’s fridge was constantly leaking water onto the floor, which was incredibly inconvenient, especially considering the meager cleaning kit they provided (which included a ""sponge"" and a tissue).
PLEASE DO NOT RENT WHITH SUCH SCAMMING COMPANY !",1
ROBBER SCAMMERS. DON'T RENT.,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, DO NOT RENT. (I give it a star because I can not put less)
At first everything seemed great when renting the caravan, until we got there and were informed that a deposit of 2000 euros had to be paid, which we had not been informed at any time when renting the camper.
After posting bail, we left there very upset that we had not received enough information.
When night came, we realized that there were no blankets and that the heating of the camper was not working, so we had to return from where we were so we could get some sheets.
But worst of all, bail has been returned. We were told several times that it was returned 3 to 7 days after returning the caravan. Seeing that this did not happen we called them, and they told us that it could take up to 10 days, very angry I called them and I had to do it several times to deign to answer. After answering, they told me that the deposit had not been released ""by accident"" according to them but that they had already released it and that it was now up to ""the bank's time"" to have the money. We called our bank to see if they could tell us something and they told us that the deposit had the release date on November 11, 2 MONTHS AFTER RENTAL. Of course, when they said they had already released him, they stopped answering all kinds of messages and calls and the times they answered they blamed the delay on the bank and its efforts.
After all the formalities, complaints and abandonment by the company I only have to put this review and report them to the consumer office for misleading advertising, poor treatment and customer service and abusive or unclear causes.
Our failure was not to read the reviews before renting, but I doubt that the few good reviews this company has are real.

Please be very careful and rent nothing with them.",1

Leaking Gas and Almost Freezing Temperatures,"I made the mistake of ignoring the reviews.

I was downgraded right before my trip and told I had no other option. The van I had paid for wasn’t available, even though it was showing on their website but at a higher price.

Vehicle was delivered with a weird half tank of gas, zero windshield fluid and low add blue. I had to pay for those right away.

Propane tank was put in last minute and I didn’t see it didn’t fit and was jammed in sideways. The gas stopped working while
in the south and the loss of two days of cooking was an inconvenience but I just turned it off. I took it to a camper sales place and they confirmed neither tank had o rings, the backup tanks, while almost empty, was able to be connected safely but the primary one was not safe to use.

The blinds on both sides won’t close giving me zero privacy and the two roof ones won’t either ensuring I am up with the sun. I often work all night so this isn’t ideal.

The toilet cassette’s wheels fell off and now won’t fit in properly. Because of this there was some leakage and I tried to hose the compartment out and some leaked into the bathroom.

Jumping forward the tank that was safe to use is now empty. I take it and get it refilled and now when I turn on the gas the whole van smells like gas. I spent the night before last in 5 degrees and last night I paid for a hotel. Tonight, however, is going to be cold and even colder for the next few days.

Indie Camper says I can drive several hundred kilometres (out of my allowance), give them another deposit for a replacement that may be just as bad so
I can continue my vacation.

I just want it to be over as this is an unsafe vehicle and I have spent a fortune buying things to stay warm and a kettle to have hot water. Indie Campers just confirmed they will not allow an early exit with refunded unused days.

I rented twice before with Roadsurfer and had a totally different experience. Nice and safe with great customer service. Will stick with them from now on.",1
Unbelievably Poor. Awful.,"We had a nightmare from the start with Indie Campers in Marseille.
Our Nomad 5 was a complete wreck: fridge not working properly (we were given a cool box); no cutlery or crockery, lock to the main cabin broken, shower door missing, sink cracked, not possible to secure the table, the hatch above the drivers opened at speed.
Crowning glory on day one was no water. We had to take it to a workshop to repair (pump was not connected to the tank). Customer service was hopeless. Getting stopped by the police for a faulty indicator was another highlight of the trip. This list of faults is not exhaustive.
By the end of the six days, my sons and I put it down to experience. However worse was to come: despite the check out going fine (and we were given a lift to the airport which was kind), a week later photo analysis highlighted a dent towards the rear (amidst the plentiful other dents, bashes and scratches) which must have happened during our rental. We lost our entire Euro 2000 deposit.
These guys are unbelievable. The staff member admitted that the Nomad 5 fleet was falling apart and they needed to get rid of them.
We were given Euro 150 compensation during our trip but this is kind of meaningless having lost 2000 euros.",1

Fraudulent service and non-existent assistance,"- Italian version (English version below) -

Do not rent absolutely from this manager! My experience, which is still ongoing, is extremely negative: I have never experienced such a poor and, dare I say it, fraudulent service. On 2 October I returned a van to Lisbon after a 10-day trip. Upon return, a local attendant checked that the van was not damaged or otherwise in the same condition as the start (for example our van had a large dent and a crawl on its side already at the start) and greeted us saying that the van was in perfect condition. Everything seemed perfect, but a few days later the problems started.

First of all, I had to contact IndieCampers multiple times to get back the 2000 euro deposit I had paid on delivery. After days of insistence on my part to resolve this situation, the bail was actually returned (but I wonder what the service would have been like if I hadn't insisted continuously for days). Even then, I thought it was all over in the right way. Instead, on October 31, IndieCampers decided to subtract me about 800 euros using the payment methods used for the rental. All this happens without any kind of communication from IndieCampers.

So I decide to write, for the umpteenth time, to the assistance, who replies that the 800 euros are due to damages discovered in the last month and that all the damages are perfectly reported in a ""Damage Report"" that I should have received. Too bad this report wasn't sent to me. They reply that in maximum 24 hours I would have received it: about 72 hours have passed and I have not yet received any news of the aforementioned report, despite the fact that I am writing to support continuously.

Damages Overcharging,"We booked an RV from Bilbao in September 24 to travel around Northern Spain. We were very excited as we thought we had a really good deal and the whole vibe during the check in was very positive. The RV was in really good condition, and everything was going smoothly until the checkout. At some point during the trip it seems that we caused a ""scratch"" on the exterior part of the tent that is mounted on the top side of the RV. Taking into account that we had paid for the premium insurance, that according to the guys in the check in didn't cover any damage in the bumpers and the roof of the car and also the fact that the scratch was not even a real scratch and it could be easily washed out, we delivered the RV on a Sunday morning, before the Bilbao Indie Campers pickup center had opened, as we had to catch an early flight. A few weeks later, we found out that this ""scratch"" was charged by Indie Camper's remote relative department, 452.09 Euros!! It seems that premium insurance doesn't cover any damage above the side windows, and not the roof as we were told. But even if this is indeed the case, Indie Campers charged a damage that shouldn't cost more than 30-40 Euros, 452.09 Euros!! We started a thread with the support team trying to explain to them that the charge is totally unrealistic, but their official reply has always been the same, that the damage cost is according to their internal standard pricing process. In other words, someone in a remote location saw a photo of a scratch and decided to charge it 10 times more, without even having a real view of the actual ""damage""! As a conclusion, Indie Campers may have really competitive rental prices, but it seems that they are trying to compensate that through overcharging damages. BTW, they are not even obliged to fix these damages, so we paid 452.09 Euros for nothing!",2
Do not use this company.,"Do not use this company!

I typically reserve my Google reviews for positive experiences, but my recent rental with Indie Campers compels me to share a deeply disappointing and troubling experience.

Initial Rental Experience: We rented a van from the Barcelona depot. While the pickup process was smooth, the van itself was noticeably well-used and not as clean as expected. Additionally, there was a lack of information provided regarding safety measures, local traffic laws, and low emission zones in the area.

The Incident: After traveling approximately 40 minutes from Barcelona, we parked in a paid public car park designated for vans. Unfortunately, our vehicle was broken into through the back window, and all our possessions were stolen. Although this incident was not Indie Campers' fault, their subsequent response was appalling.

Customer Support Failures: Despite advertising a 24-hour helpline, we were unable to reach anyone via phone, email, WhatsApp, or their online chatbot. Frustrated and distressed, we returned to the depot the next day seeking assistance as it said online they were closed. Instead of support, we were informed that we would need to cover the costs for the broken window, forfeit our deposit, and pay an additional deposit for a replacement vehicle. All of which were covered in the insurance we took with them.

Unsafe Vehicle and Inflexible Policies: Feeling unsafe in the original van due to its easily breakable PVC window, we requested to switch to a more secure model with glass windows and no advertising. Despite multiple available options, Indie Campers denied our request, stating that if we felt unsafe, we could leave the van but would forfeit our money. Unable to afford this loss, we reluctantly accepted a smaller replacement van under the insurance policy. However, we were told we could not be refunded the price difference, even though the new van was cheaper.

Issues with the Replacement Van: The replacement van was significantly smaller, less comfortable, and lacked essential amenities like a toilet—particularly problematic as I am six months pregnant. Additionally, the van was very well-used, with visible damage, broken cups, and unclean equipment. While the depot staff were sympathetic, they were ultimately “unable” to assist us, and the manager we spoke to was equally unsympathetic and unhelpful. We were directed to file a formal complaint, which, as of today, remains unanswered.

Financial and Policy Concerns: Indie Campers seemed intent on extracting additional fees at every turn. Upon returning the van, our diesel fuel was not refunded despite leaving a third tank. We were also charged €4 for exceeding the mileage limit by just 14 kilometers, completely ignoring the extra trips to and from the depot we had to make. Furthermore, it was evident that the policies on windows and damage were being obscured with post-it notes, and signs prohibiting vehicle tours before pickup or drop-off were present, indicating a lack of transparency.

Overall Experience: We initially ignored other negative reviews, assuming they pertained to different locations or isolated incidents. However, our experience confirmed that these reviews were accurate. Indie Campers' staff admitted to issues with fairness and cited growing too quickly for a startup as a reason for their shortcomings. Their lack of compassion, flexibility, and understanding was shocking, especially given their marketing focus on safe and happy travel experiences.

Final Thoughts: We are not blaming Indie Campers for the robbery, but their handling of the situation was exceptionally poor. There was no apology, no proper vehicle sign-off, or safety checks, even after experiencing nearby deadly flash floods. The complete lack of concern for customer safety and well-being was both surprising and disappointing.

Based on our experience, I strongly advise against renting from Indie Campers. Their focus on profit over customer care and safety makes them unreliable and untrustworthy.",1
Do not rent with indie campers!,"I would not hire with indie campers again. We planned our trip with the indie campers team and went over our route of each country we were planning to visit, we double checked with them that we had the suitable toll stickers and vignettes for the countries we were going to. About a month after our trip ended we revived a fine for €170 (the fine was actually for €120 but indie campers are charging us €50 extra for being fined) as we apparently did not have one of the right vignettes for our trip. If the indie campers team did not know what vignettes and toll stickers we required they should not have told us they did. In addition to this, we were told we would get a full tank of gas when we set off however we were given an empty tank meaning we had to pay to refill the bottle when we were there which was a very lengthy process. The van itself was lovely and I wish I could have given a good review, but this company is full of additional hidden costs and do not offer any help.",1
Disaster,"It was a disaster.
The turn signal and windshield wiper broke off on the first day. It was just glued. That's gross negligence.
Indie Camper didn't help us. You said everything was fine when you handed it over. We therefore lost two days and were unable to drive our route as planned.
We would like to warn you not to book with Indie Camper.
The quality of the camper was also a disaster.
The camper was also dirty!!!!",1
Take many photos and videos at the van return,"When we rented this summer we had a lot of fun in the van we rented from IndieCampers. The service itself was correct.
However, before renting from them you should be aware that it seems common for them to charge for damage within 30 days of renting. Damage that many users suspect IndieCampers invented.
In order to avoid disappointment, we encourage potential users to take numerous photos and videos of the vehicle both at the time of collection and upon return.
In our case, when we returned the van, the staff on site told us that everything was in order after completing a tour of the vehicle. We were surprised to learn 2 weeks later that we had to pay several hundred francs in fees for a scratch that we are certain we did not cause. Unfortunately, we didn't think to make photos and videos at the time of the vehicle's return, and therefore couldn't dispute. It's hard to tell if it's really a habit at home, but in our case the employee advised us to take many photos and videos when he entrusted us with the vehicle, but was careful not to do so when returning.",2
bad experiance,"We rented a camper for 4 days at a cost of over 900 euros, we received it over an hour late and it had no hot water for 3 days. Contacting customer service did not help.
Let's say it's still tolerable. Two weeks after we returned it, we received an additional charge on the credit card of 500 euros for damage they claimed we caused to the toilets in the caravan. I am not aware of such damage, and I am still waiting (a month and a half has passed) for them to send me proof of damage at my request (photos, repair invoice, anything). First of all, they charge the customer, without asking or explaining, not clear by what right... and they don't bother to send proof of the damage either.
They charged me 420 euros for cleaning the camper! Almost half the rental cost.
We returned a clean and tidy camper, and even if we assume not, I don't know how many workers need to be hired to clean a camper, the cost of which should add up to this astronomical amount.
don't book",1
Worst experience ever Indie Campers,"Never ever book Indie Campers. We had booked and paid for one with pickup from Dusseldorf
Pick up was actually a 90 euro Uber away.
Got there van had no petrol, no gas, no linen flat Tyre, dirty
Then they wanted 2000 euro bond which was never mentioned..we had no confidence in the place so had to make decision to walk away and cost us another 1400 euro for accommodation
You can't talk to anyone. Communication skills are terrible",1
Fraudster company,"They're slit faces (cheeky)! First, I find it very unprofessional for the company to reserve details for customers to stop doing or doing things, in order to be able to charge them extra without any qualms. I paid for a package that included post-travel cleaning. Wherever you rent and pay for a cleaning, all that is required is a minimum of order and that everything is in proper condition. What they did in Indicampers was give me two bags so that I had to remove the bedding myself (besides, I gave them four blankets as a gift, since the coat they delivered was not enough). I was charged for cleaning, even though everything was spotless, even swept away, except that the slab (complete and every thing that happened to me, which were also very few, and I had to buy many things on my own) was stored in the box, washed quickly, WITHOUT FOOD OR REMAINS.

On the other hand, at the time the car was delivered, I was informed that the discharge was done and they had to show me that the “pull plugs” were outside, as the buttons indicating if it was empty or full were bad and “full” appeared, and I had to believe them. When I returned it, I previously discharged the waters, as I was connected in a camper for four days. I did exactly what I was told and I have a video recorded: “you should do the unloading and then hose it down for a while and you’re done.” The amazing and really frustrating thing is that when I handed it over, with a flashlight they checked from the toilet entrance to see if there was anything left in the pond and said, “there are papers still in the pond.” Impossible! I made sure I didn't flush papers and dump them in separate bags in the dumpsters. Then they asked me, “Do you have the pills that came in the kit?” I handed them over, flushed them and told me I had to wait and then rinse again (of course, since you know you deliver the car on the last day and usually have the flight, you waste your time to justify charging). The person who delivers the car never mentions how thorough the check will be at the time of delivery so that you at least try to comply with that, nor that inside the kit there are pills that serve to clean the pond. Even so, I assure you that they would charge the same, because I am not the first to claim for this. $250 is an excess and abuse, as well as being a charge for a cleanup already paid for and for a discharge that costs $10 at a dump station.

I would never rent again on Indicampers, and every time you ask me, it is impossible for a good recommendation to come out of this scam company.",1
Worst renting experience. DO NOT RENT.,"Worst renting experience I've ever encountered. DO NOT RENT WITH INDIE.

Enormous amounts for small damages : We were charged 2400€ for a dent in the side panel, that we had to pay on the spot when we did the chek-out. Indiecampers doesn't even let you a few days to get the amount on your account, you have to find an immediate solution. (even though they have my driver's licence + all of my personnal information)

Hidden fees : They came back at us 4 days laters making me pay another 500€ for the EXACT SAME DENT, pretexting that it's another one because it's 10cm away.

They also make you pay an extra 15€ when reimbursing the tolls, even though they clearly said ""We're gonna take care of the tolls payment because you have an automated pass in the Van, we'll come back with an invoice"" but still charge you 15€ more saying that ""Indie Campers is authorized to charge a €15 administrative fee for the process of identifying the driver and liaising with the transit entity."". Issue is they didn't let us choose how we paid the tolls, so they make you pay the 15€ anyway.

Useless customer support : We had van battery issues during our trip which the customer service did not help with (only point of contact you have is a whatsapp live tchat...).
We got stuck in the mud, and the customer service staff barely helped us to find a local towing company.

Only good point was the Oslo pickup center staff which was very kind and very comprehensive.

My only advice : do not rent a van with indiecampers.",1
Don't rent with Indie Campers,All I can tell you is to be careful with renting at Indie Campers. They are very irresponsible and take care of nothing. We rented an Etrusco profiled camper for 23 days and had no help wheel. We specifically asked the attendant in Paris if it broke and he answered to speak on TE and it would be solved. Unfortunately it happened and they sent me to speak to the SOS of the route. They have no help on routes. I had to pay €740 for the trailer and they didn't take over. Plus I paid the premium insurance to be quiet and nothing. They're crap.,1
"absolute hell, ruined trip","My reservation number is J0VV3P. My left low beam headlight doesn't work!!!! When filling the tank with water, it simply leaks out due to leaks!!! The battery charge lasts for a couple of hours with the engine off, provided that the energy is spent only on autonomous heating!!! That is, what this car was created for is missing!! I would like to hear clarification from you on this matter...
My reservation number is J0VV3P. I also want to add that we were given dirty bed linen, which is why we sleep in sleeping bags. Autonomous heating only works when the engine is on; this is a consequence of the fact that the battery has been in need of replacement for a long time; it has simply used up its resource. When the engine is turned on, the timing belt makes a lot of noise and prevents us from sleeping, our engine also interferes with the sleep of the surrounding people on the camp site, which is why I have to constantly look for a place at the maximum distance from others....",1
"Worthless service, worthless business.","Indie Campers is unfortunately not the company they exude to be. First of all, the camper must be picked up in very remote places. Then we had to wait 2 hours before it was our turn and there was a lot of hassle about the deposit. In addition, the first camper revealed defects even before we were gone, so we had to wait again to get another camper (which also had various defects).
In the meantime, this has been over a year, and we paid all the tolls at the post office on our last day in accordance with the rules of Indie Campers. However, the Portuguese system is slowing down, so we (apparently) had one toll bill outstanding later. However, this was not known to us, and cannot be paid from abroad. Now, more than a year later, we got this bill from Indie Campers (of 3.21) with a fine of 15 euros. There was supposedly nothing they could do about this. We will no longer book with Indie Campers. Fucking company.",1
Super bad customer service!!,"Renting from Indie Campers was a major disappointment. Upon picking up the camper, I found it in poor condition—dirty, with broken features, and clearly not maintained. Despite my complaints, the staff seemed indifferent and unhelpful.
After returning the vehicle, I was shocked to receive charges for damages that were pre-existing. Luckily, I had documented the condition of the camper, which helped me contest these unfair claims.
The customer service was frustratingly unresponsive, and their billing practices felt deceptive. Overall, my experience with Indie Campers was stressful and unsatisfactory. I strongly advise potential renters to consider other options and document everything meticulously if they choose to proceed with this company.",1
You will be scammed out of your deposit...,"Renting an IndieCampers van is all great until you get to the security deposit part. You can read all about it from Reddit posts and I will contribute here with my story.

I delivered a van after an 8 day trip, which went OK. I left it clean and treated it as if it was my own. There was some damage on the top-right-back corner of the van which was found by their after-trip analysis. I don't recall the moment the damage was done but I don't question it as they take photos before and after. I also parked close to trees so no problem there. As expected I would cover the damages. All good so far. Now let's get to the value! They are going to keep 1869.24 euros from my deposit because that is the cost of the repair. ??? Almost 1.9K to fix a ""light dent""; their words not mine?

They also didn't send this damage report until now, 2 months after the trip, I guess because they were not sure how to deliver this ridiculous news.

If you are comfortable with trusting them with a large security deposit or paying overpriced insurance, go ahead, otherwise, I would avoid.

I am completely open to negotiation and paying for damage in rentals but not like this and not these values.",1
a NIGHTMARE,"With one word: a NIGHTMARE. A total disaster: the van broke due to lack of ordinary maintenance and after that moment nobody was able to support us in any way, nobody was willing to take accountability. We were completely left alone with a broken vehicle (not because of us, but even in that case it would be wrong, especially because we paid for the extra insurance).
The negative online reviews are true: as soon as you have any kind of little issue, your are left alone and you lose holiday time.
A tip: be sure to travel with good and positive friends, who are able to cheer up the mood.
Check-in: This is not a check-in service. People who work in the pick-up centre should be able to give the right informations, help you in any possible way and they should care about the customer. Nicer people would be great.
(PS: we had to change the first van with another one, and they asked for another 500€ deposit.........)",1
INDIE CAMPERS SUCK,"The vehicle was nice and everything went well at first , the customer service sucks , nobody answered the phone when we had trouble with the roof tent , the video they send you to get to know the vehicle is from the early 2000 probably , and didnt include all the precautions you need to take to ensure nothing happens to the vehicle or the tent in our case , We paid the inaurance and we had bad climate in a lake , and the tent flew over the camper , broke from the camper and we had to pay 1500 EUROS on a tent that the cost is 400 euros ,,we explained that in the video they sent us there was no explanation that we had in the vehicle this pins that hold the tent to the ground , if we had seen it in the video we would have used them ,,, we explained this and wrote to custumer service and they didnt care , they charged us the 1500 EUROS wich is an abuse to their clients , i told them that if the tent was to be charged its ok but you will ship it so i can fix it and use it in one of my vehicles , and they said that they cannot do it because it was property of INDIE CAMPERS ,,, and they cannot ship the part because it was they're property and they didnt have to ship the part wich i paid 3 times its cost and it was theirs ,,, so for me im never renting with them in my life ,, the insurance is not good if you dont pay the best insurance , its ridiculous , they didnt help me at all in customer service , and basically i feel robed for paying a tent 3 times its cost and didnt get to keep it ,,, from me your not getting a penny more for INDIE CAMPERS , people if you rent with this company pay the full ensurance ao you wont get any surprises at the end of your journey ,,, and INDIE CAMPERS , make sure you update your videos , wich probably takes one day to get them better ,,, you lost me as a client",1
Bad.,"Bad experience!
In May 2024, together with two friends, we rented a van to make a roadtrip in Iceland for a week. It turns out we had the chance of a duck hitting our glass, damaging it. As recommended by the company, we contacted the 24-hour service to resolve the problem, and the problems started. As stated in the contract it is the contractor's responsibility to call a trailer. Initially they gave a quick solution that would be about 50 km away, which allowed a quick solution to the problem. We were warned that we could be rested that they would handle the matter (contrary to the context). What is not our surprise when, without knowing why, the company contacts another service that would be more than 700 km from where we were, this service that would take about 7 to 8 hours to arrive, we ended up waiting for more than 10 hours! Since we were informed that this service was on its way, we could only wait for it. During this process we talked to more than 4 people in the assistance chat, all of them without knowing exactly what was going on having to be us to explain everything again.
With the arrival of the trailer comes the worst possible news, we had to be ours to pay an exorbitant amount, about 5400€. We made the return trip to the only IndieCampers shipyard in the whole island and, in conversation with the staff, realized that it would be an absurd value even given the high values practiced in the country.
Upon returning to Portugal, we contacted a lawyer to see if this whole process was correct. We were never returned the communication, not even by registered letter. It was impossible to contact IndieCampers.
After this episode the image of IndieCampers is very bad, a company you can not trust, which provides contradictory information and is not clear in its communication. A great disappointment and I will definitely never hire your services again.",1
Fraudsters!,"We ordered an atlas 5 motorhome in Milan, we are from Spain, we went by plane to Milan, we arrived where they have to give us the car and they tell us that that motorhome has been broken and that they do not have it... at the same time we get an email that tells us that they replace it with an Etruscan ""a lower motorhome"", we tell it to the guys there and they tell us that they do not have any Etruscan, that they can only give us a camper the nomad pop top that was there with barely load without gasoline, we go that they had just left it. We want to make a claim and they give us a whatsapp that answers you a bot, we have no choice but to leave with the camper since we had 3h that even they did not know what to do... When we arrive to return it we tell the whole story to the girl who receives us and gives us a phone number that you can call and finally talk to a person, explain the case and tell us that it will give us compensation, obviously all lies, still not finished the film, a week later we get an email and we are told that they have received a report of an accident we have had with another vehicle, that if so inform them that they have insurance, obviously also false. In conclusion we have not been given any compensation and still have the €2000 bail that from what I see they want to put us in a fabricated accident. Hope you read this before you rent there.

NEVER RENT FROM INDIE CAMPER,"Their campers are of very poor quality and when you need help (because something will 100% break in these low-quality campers) their costumer support is terrible.

Never book on this website,"2052179

Never book on this website!

We rent a jeep with pop-up tent for 7 nights in Las Vegas. The check-in was catastrophic, the jeep was not cleaned, the sheets of the previous customer were still in the tent, the access ladder was not the right one, the vehicle is given with less than a quarter of the full and must be returned at this level, the tires were at the indicator of wear and the person in charge of the site tells us “you can go to discount tyres, they will change them for you for free!” so I rent a vehicle with an additional package in km and I have to go change the tires?? Everything I mentioned before would not have changed if we had not checked everything.

From our 1st night, we realized that the fridge power outlet was not in the vehicle so 1 week without fridge in the desert, the differential that allows to choose between 2 wheel drive or 4x4 was broken so impossible to drive between 4x4 mode, this prevented us from accessing places we had planned to visit thanks to this mode. Objects of the additional equipment (tables, chairs) are really bad bills, the table was broken so did not hold the high position.

After realizing this we contacted the service by phone and Whatsapp message. By phone we have a robot that talks to us and redirects us to the website where no human answers us, and on Whatsapp a reply in 30 minutes is announced, well it’s been 9 days that I wrote and still no news, the same for the email sent to “excellence service”

We probably wouldn’t have been so disappointed if we had chosen a local hire company with low promises, but for the moment Indie Camper promises an efficient service, a hassle-free trip, and an excellent experience at 1400€ per week!!

I hope to have an answer one day from their services because it is not normal to sell powder to the eyes and not have problems afterwards

I will never go back to this site, and invite you to do the same!",1

After 60 days I have NOT been refunded the 2,000 euro bond, they should have returned it within 15 days because I had no damage, it is held in my bank until they feel like giving you a button! There is no customer service, they do not give me solution, it is a shame of company, they abuse the helpless people under this desperate situation. I've heard from a friend who knows more people who've done this to him! I will never rent with this company again without regard to people. SHAMEFUL",1
Terrible,"A truly questionable trip from the very beginning. We arrived in Porto to pick up the van and waited 1 hour and 30 minutes. After that, they handed us a visibly questionable van. We realized during the drive south that there were missing parts and others that were falling apart.

The door handles come off if pulled to open the doors... then the biggest problem: we realized that the key no longer opens or closes the doors, and the electronic button lock is broken. Not to mention the musty smell throughout the van...

We called the company’s number, and they told us to get in touch via WhatsApp. The operator on the other end told us to continue our journey because, in his opinion, it wasn’t a big problem... (not being able to lock or enter the vehicle isn’t a big problem...).

So, there was a heated discussion, and they told us to go to Lisbon to change the van (the contact with the support team happened at 10:30 in the morning). We drove for 2 hours and 40 minutes to get to Lisbon, and when we arrived, no one was informed about the problem. We waited 3 hours before the new van was ready, which was much larger than what we had booked in advance. We received no refund for gas, tolls, or the time we lost.

Terrible vacation, terrible van, and terrible company; even the second van had questionable odors... we paid 100 euros for cleaning, but it wasn’t cleaned at all.

If I could give less than one star, I would! Never again!!",1
DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY,"My husband and I rented a campervan from Indie Campers, and after 30 miles of highway driving, the clutch burnt out and we were left stranded and our whole vacation ruined. Despite paying for 24/7 roadside assistance, the company support told us they couldn't help us so the host had to use her personal insurance to have is towed. We were charged our full security deposit of $3700 CAD to pay for the repairs on the vehicle, despite 1, the vehicle had just been returned from a 750 mile rental the day we got it, and 2, the cost of the repairs were $800 less than the security deposit so the company pocketed the extras. The company has done everything to redirect us away from them by wasting our time trying to get money from the third-party insurance company they use (Riverside) only to be told they can't help us either (but they did say they agreed we should not be held responsible for the repairs given the circumstance). I can go on and on and on how horrendous the business practices are of this company, but I'll leave it at that and hope everyone sees this review before considering renting from Indie Campers.",1
"DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER FOR A LOWER PRICE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. What we thought would be the best trip of the year soon",THIS COMPANY PUTS YOUR LIFE IN DANGER AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

Lousy experience with IndieCampers!,"Lousy experience with IndieCampers! We rented a van between September 30 and October 5, 2024 (6 days) and from the second day EVERYTHING went wrong. First the van's internal lights failed, then an engine warning appeared, then handbrake failure and worst of all: THE BRAKES FAILED COMPLETELY! Yeah, the brakes. We ran out of brakes in the middle of the road because the van did not have even basic brake fluid maintenance. This caused an accident that could have been much worse.

The worst is not only the extreme negligence of delivering a vehicle to us in those conditions, but now they are trying to charge us 1388 euros for the accident they caused with their lack of maintenance. Their customer service is a joke, they just sent me absurd instructions like it was my job to fix their ramshackle van.

This trip was complete chaos and ruined our vacation. Instead of enjoying ourselves, we were all the time concerned about our safety and trying to fix problems that should never have existed. IndieCampers is not only irresponsible, it is also dangerous. They don't care about the safety of their clients. Don't rent with them if they value your life and your money!

DON'T rent from Indie Camper!,"Indie Campers is unfairly holding up my money!
This is a story of injustice and an unacceptable customer approach.
In short - We had a flight cancellation due to a threatening attack by Iran on Israel. We had a hard time communicating with INDIE and faced some inflexible and fixed approaches to our case, although it is an extreme case that was not under our control!
After all - I had to replan and reschedule everything from scratch.
Unfortunately, there were 700 Euros differences in the price - I was refused to get any of it nor to get it back as a voucher! On top of that because of minor damage, they charged us 500 Euros instead of subtracting and although we had premium insurance (we tried to use all the money that was left on their side! )
On the last day of my trip, I found out that the amount was being documented literally as a ""refund"" on my Indie account but only visible to the customer service staff - I was shocked. They don't want to release our money!

very low quality,"The local service and staff are of very low quality. Long waits. I advise paying extreme attention during the camper pick-up phase, checking the tires, ensuring it is clean, and that all required accessories are present, including the cable and water hose.

In our case, they initially offered us a camper with bald tires, dirty, missing accessories, and several non-functioning items, including the side windows, which, unfortunately, we noticed did not stay open only during the rental period and were unjustly charged to us as damage. When I asked for photos of the functioning windows during the pick-up phase, they told me that they were not available. Unacceptable!",1
Awful! Stay away from them,"It’s unfair that we even have to rate this company with one star. My advice, as echoed by many others: stay away from this company. There are better alternatives in Spain and nearby (which we found out later) that offer much better service.

We waited at the depot for two hours to receive our Active van. During that time, three other couples were also waiting, each dealing with their own van issues, while other customers kept coming back with problems—an absolute mess. 2 of them asked for a full refund after driving for 20 minutes and encountering difficulties with the van itself. Our van had no water at all, but still the staff pressured us to take it, claiming they had no other options. They gave us Indie Campers' customer service number, instructed us to take the van without water, and suggested we ask for compensation later (don’t bother—they won’t compensate!). After waiting an additional two hours, a technician finally arrived and fixed the issue. While they initially refunded us for the Essential Kit, we discovered two days later that the charge had been reinstated—completely useless.

The chiller wasn’t working, so all our food was ruined—it didn’t even work when plugged in. We were forced to dine out and absorb the extra costs because, as expected, they wouldn’t cover them. They even had the audacity to suggest we purchase a new fridge ourselves and submit the receipt later—would you trust them to refund that? Not at all. Plus, I shouldn’t have to spend time during my holiday dealing with problems they should be handling.

To top it all off, our van wasn’t even insured for the first two days, despite us having paid for it. The staff at the depot were so overwhelmed that they forgot to activate it (thankfully, we didn’t have any accidents).

The vans are in terrible condition. When you arrive for check-in, it becomes clear that your van hasn’t been properly inspected—no water, battery not charged, nothing. You’re left waiting while they scramble to check everything, and that’s when the problems start. They simply don’t have time between rentals, and they’re clearly understaffed. The team is burned out and visibly frustrated with the company.

We all want to enjoy our holidays, but this experience was a complete nightmare. It’s a real shame because Portugal is beautiful, but this situation completely ruined it for us.",1
Don’t rent. You will regreat it. They lie cheat and deceive you. Absolute garbage units and service is even worse.,"Absolutely no customer support or service.

They only gonna take your money and your luck to get out of parking lot with out unit having major problems and they don’t care. Even with the 50 bucks a day insurance to cover it. You will spend twice as much trying to collect.
Absolutely zero customer service and no phone. Just a chat bot. And zero refunds for anything . No matter what. Even if you spend two weeks in the service center. You will pay for the renting of two weeks even if you never use it",1

We had to clean the whole camper ourselves, buy tools to fix the table and buy our own bed sheets to not freeze to death. All because contacting their help departement is completely useless, no help at all. They care 0 for their costumers, they just want your money.",1
THE WORST,"A few facts:
Van broke down around 5pm, only one day after the rent started.
I've tried to reach Indie campers immediately as the emergency took place . Didn't get any feedback until midnight - there is no way to call them by phone. Neither for emergencies. Only via email or a useless WhatsApp chat. I had to navigate the website for 30 minutes in order to understand what to do.
It turns out that I need to contact the insurance of the van. Finally I could arrange to be rescued by the tow truck.

Every time I tried to communicate with them I have never had the same operator which followed the case. Always a new one and I had to tell my story every time again. Really frustrating.
After one week I'm still waiting for feedback and for my money. I had to book another car with another company to continue my trip. I have received no assistance nor allowance nor refund nor courtesy car by Indie Campers.

After almost one month, I haven't yet neither a clear feedback on the next steps of the practice, nor my money (1300€). That's really outrageous.

Zero value for money. My worst experience ever. Would never recommend it. I give only one star because I cannot give less.",1

Nightmare trip with Indiecampers
We rented an Active IndieCamper Van for two weeks. We were very excited about this trip however it turned into our worst nightmare. We picked the Van at the depot it was fine, the Van looked more worn out than we expected it. They gave us a short explanation but told us to check the video for further details. We later realised the video was lacking a few details that were quite important ,how to get rid of the grey water for our Van especially and how to fill the water tank.
After further inspections we realised few things in the Van were not there as expected or broken, no rear parking sensor, fridge was extremely small and not properly working, the piece to refill the water tank was missing/ didn’t fit any of the points to refill the water, lots of scratches on the outside and inside, upper windows not properly closing. On the second day we had a small accident and the real nightmare started, we contacted the customer support team they were giving us very confusing answers and couldn’t really tell us if we were covered by the insurance or not. We were not able to contact someone in person to clarify our doubts after the accident. The customer support was giving us the same routine answer to all our questions. This made us have a very anxious trip as we didn’t know what cost we were expecting for the repair of the van, they didn’t want to tell us even though we send pictures. We had to cut our plans short as we wanted to avoid any extra damage so we stayed at a camping place until the end of our trip. When we brought the Van back we were told that everything was fine and we would get the deposit back. We were quite surprised because we notified them about the damage and expected them to tell us about prices and next steps to take. We got the deposit back and a few days later they charged our credit card without previously notifying us about it. My friend had to request an explanation to understand the cost that were charged to us. They send a picture and a price no cost break-down nothing. We requested a in detail cost-breakdown that they refuse to provide. We understand that we have to pay for the damage but at least provide us with some explanation on how you calculate the cost because 3305€ for a dent and scratch on the top of the van is a lot of money to pay! Never eve booking with Indie Campers again.",1
Last time renting here,"Terrible experience. Avoid where possible. The cheap rental price is compensated for costs at the end. A small dent in the side of the Van is now costing us €2,200 without a chance for an explanation (money was suddenly withdrawn from our account). The receptionist said he can’t help and I need to call the hotline, who then again said she couldn’t help, need to write an email.
Additionally, we didn’t receive adequate cooking equipment, having to buy our own, and bed equipment not even adequate for one bed (although we booked a bus with two), meaning we all froze at night time).
Last time!!",1
Van Trip in Spain,"they told us that the chemical toilet pad had already been inserted but it was not and the first emptying of the black water was not a good experience... after a few km the indicator light to insert the adblue starts... 30 €... the gas came out of the stove with very little flame, changing the gas cylinder same thing... main mosquito net with holes and the shutters jammed or did not hook and detach continuously. For the rest for goodness sake a nice experience anyway, maybe next time we'll hope for a better van",2
Indie Campers= The worst service company in the world.,"The worst service company in the world. They deliver dirty motorhomes, without emptying the tanks, without properly insulating, with smoke alarms that are constantly raised when cooking, with constant vibration of the windows and entrance door, falling parts, no indicator works, so suddenly it tells you that you have to change the oil, the hose to discharge the wastewater without adapter. In our case the second day dirty water started coming out through the shower. If you need to turn on the generator the smell of gas is tremendous and better open fans and windows. And finally you find that you have been charged penalties at the price of a luxury hotel room, for arriving late having given advance notice and without any information and ambiguous answers plus constant threats of penalties. We're going to claim the company and the U.S. consumer bureau, which is where we took it. And certainly don’t even think about renting or relocating with this company.",1
I can only warn against Indie Campers! – Never again Indie Campers!,"I can only warn against Indie Campers! – Never again Indie Campers!

I rented and paid for a motorhome with a premium package (incl. a fully comprehensive with 199€ excess) at Indie Campers in Frankfurt am Main (Maintal) for almost 500,00€ and felt completely secure.
During the rental period there was a small accident with minor sheet metal damage / scratches (see photo, rear right).
I wanted to report the damage directly to Indie Campers, but couldn't reach anyone on the day of the accident and also for 2 subsequent 2 days!
On the 3rd day I was finally able to chat with a person at Indie Campers very time consuming (not on the phone!) and it was agreed that I should fill out a claim form that was not present in the camper when returning it.
When I returned this form, I received it from an Indie Campers employee and filled it out completely (for insurance).
After that I was told only in English that I had to pay the tremendous sum of almost 4,000€ for the damage to the camper, which I refused, because I had bought the premium package after all and there was a fully comprehensive insurance with 199€ excess in it!
I took a taxi to the airport with my wife without making a payment because we had to catch our flight to Brazil.
One day later, without notice and without my knowledge, Indie Campers simply debited this tremendous amount from PayPal!
I didn't realize that the collection procedure was about the two
Payments for the rent of the camper is still valid!
This is cheating on the customer and pure rip-off!
Many people have reviewed Indie Campers negatively on the Internet.
I have called in my lawyer, who will return the collected, high sum, minus the deductible, and can only warn against Indie Campers!
Never again will I book a camper at Indie Campers, which is out to rip off and deceive its customers!

CON ARTISTS! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"SCAM COMPANY!!! Avoid!!!! DO NOT rent from indie campers. They are screwing over thousands of people out of thousands of eur/usd/gbp. They purposely buy faulty vehicles knowing they will break down and then they are very pushy for you, the customer to work on the vehicle yourself. If you do it, you are then liable for the damages and they will start taking money from your credit/debit card. Their customer service team also lie about what they’re doing to try to help you. My family and I rented a van from them and the power steering stopped working. We were on our way to a motorway but luckily I went the wrong way and had to turn around down a side street, where the steering stopped working. If that had happened at high speed it could have been catastrophic and fatal. They took 10 hours to call a tow truck because for those 10 hours they wouldn’t stop trying to convince me to do some handy work on their van. I was stranded with my wife and two kids (4 & 2) in the rain and cold. I called 5 local mechanics who all advised me to absolutely not do any work on their van. It’s obviously their responsibility and their insurance should have covered it. There are thousands of forum entries and Facebook groups with countless stories of various ways they con people. They also hire people to write good reviews for them, so ignore those!!
They will ruin your vacation and steal from your bank account. Avoid them, report them, and look a reputable company instead!",1
Stay away from Indie Campers!,Stay away from Indie Campers. They will charge you hundreds if not thousands of EUR/USD for simple dents that cost 50 EUR/USD at most. Their insurance does not cover the most basic cases. Please don't do it yourselves!,1
"INDIE CAMPERS NEVER AGAIN, I DON’T RECOMMEND.","This company was not the best choice for our trip, everything is an additional cost: basic insurance does not cover anything, included kilometers are ridiculous, bed linen not included, kitchen supplies to pay separately, a simple hand broom, gas, etc. The vehicle was delivered to us dirty, without AddBlue, with a chemical tank. It was dirty, the seat was broken. We had an accident and the door mirror kit broke. We were charged an amount equivalent to three times the price of a new mirror, in other words, they want to make money from customer accidents.

Bad experience,"Bad experience. We rented a campervan for the first week of September. The RV was delivered dirty. The site in Marcon where the vehicle was collected is in a situation on the verge of hygiene. We had an appointment at 1:00 p.m. to pick up the vehicle. Nobody in the office welcomed us and after 45 minutes we were expecting a guy, who in the meantime had entertained himself to talk to foreign tourists, handed us the vehicle doing a very quick and summary check out. We took the camper home to load it and spent half a day cleaning it. There were ants, hair everywhere and the chemical toilet was filthy. We left for our trip too bad that the same evening the water did not come out of the sinks because the pump had broken. We asked for assistance from the Indie numbers. Assistance was practically not given to us. We advised that we were going back to the Marcon office to solve the problem. I point out that we were stuck on the street without water with 3 small children. Back at the Marcon headquarters the Indie employees made us lose another 3 hours before, because as the only solution they proposed to give us a camper that was not sanitized,
then because they asked for a new deposit on a credit card, a card that was blocked from their previous deposit made at the time of rental. They basically didn't give us any campers and they kept our money.
After making the refund request they replied that their procedures do not provide for refund. They basically kept the money without giving us the service we paid for. I strongly advise against this company.",1
DON'T RENT AT INDIE CAMPERS,"Indie Campers péssima escolha, na receção estavam 2 Jovens < 20 anos a «despachar» mais de 15 clientes numa só tarde. Vemos o video do funcionamento mas não conseguimos testar - pe, a agua quente que não funciona, a tenda do Jeep Wrangler que deixa entrar agua quando chove, atendimento por mail e Whatsapp quando surgem os problemas e que não nos arranjam hotel, deram-nos uma morada onde estavam umas casas de madeira com telefone que nunca atenderam, com aspeto abandonado, lixo a porta. Tivemos de arranjar hotel para 2 pessoas 3 noites enquanto roupas, edredons, almofadas secaram... NUNCA re-embolsados. Dão a hipotese de andar 200 km x 2 (ida e volta) para arranjar o buraco da tenda que já estava identificado pois já tinha fita cola a «tapar». Pretendem que sejam os clientes a fazer a manutenção das carrinhas e a gastar o tempo de férias para tal. Já tinha tido essa experiencia nos Pirinéus em 2021 - perdi 2 dias numa oficina sem poder usar a carrinha para transporte e a ter de ficar num Hotel. Dei mais uma hipotese A Indie e foi muito mau. Durante este tempo usei carrinhas de outras companhias sem qq problema. Desaconselho INDIE We rented a Conquest Van and a Jeep Wrangler with a tent for 3 wks in the US for 6 adults and one baby 2 yr old - we started in salt Lake city and dropped off in Seattle. For this we paid 7500 + 5000 euros. We were included in a larger group with 4 other Conquest Vans - total amount exceeded 35000 euros - we thought we could have special rete or special treatment ... The 1st problems was because I made a mistake when booking the wrangler and I said I would start in Seattle and drop off in salt lake, the other way around. When I noticed the mistake, 3 wks before departure, I informed Indie Campers and they charged me another 600 euros. Special treatment ... When we arrived to Salt Lake to chen in there were 2 yeong boys < 20 yrs old to check in more than 10-15 vans.... The van were dirty and, although you may see the videos before, it's impossible to confirm that everything is working properly. So on the 1st day we found out that the main door of the Conquest van did not close well, it happened to open while we were driving. We neve had hot water in the Conquest, always had to shower inb the parks WC, sometimes far specially with a 2 yr old. Worse than that, on the 3rd day it rained a lot and we found out that there was a hole in the tent (already known because it was partially covered with regualar tape...), all the inside matress covers pillows, pijamas were soaked. WE contacted Indie and they booked a cabin for 2 people - when we went to that cabin nobody answered, we called 2 phone #s which never answered, the placed looked abandoned with lots of trash outside. We paid for 3 nights in a motel, the cheapest in town - 700 USD for 3 nights for 2 people - never reimburesed. The remaining 17 nights we slept 6 adults and one baby in the Conquest Van - we only used the Jeep for driving of part of the group. We asked for being re-imbused but so far no contacts were made.",1
"Legal scam, maintenance at YOUR cost","Be aware your holidays can turn to a nightmare in few seconds.
Team is nice but the company isn’t. Motorhome poor furbished and engine failure and repair at YOUR cost.
Engine: I had to pay for the maintenance of the engine in a garage as some lights starts to appeared on the dashboard. The company doesn’t cover for the engine maintenance but want it same as we took it or they charge you. Imagine when it arrived day 2 of the holidays when I wasn’t responsible for this. Surely the unlucky of the 5 last people however my bills went way up and even the “Customer service” refuse to pay for the repairs.
Furniture: sleep 6 but only 3 outside chairs, a small outside table 50 by 70cm, 2 plates of each, 2 spoon, a coffee maker for 1 person, the bedsheet didn’t cover the full bed, the second bed didn’t had the bedsheet or the duvet. No adaptador for legal camping plugs. Heater works 1 on 2 and never when plugged to electricity. Blackout or mostico net didn’t work so had to maintain them down with headphone cable. Water pipe to fill the tank is 2m long! Just a joke at the moment of using it. Never see so little investment in the furniture make you holidays enjoyable.

Indie Campers is the last company I recommend to have a nice relaxing time. All the extra of the motorhome is at your financial cost, the furniture make your day to day miserable and the engine maintenance poorly done hby them will be added to your invoice at the end of the holidays with no way of see it back.
Be careful with this legal scam.",1

Terrible experience! Don't do it!,"Terrible experience! Don't do it!
We could only take the camper 4 hours after the pick-up time. The air conditioning was broken, very annoying in California. The bed linen, pillows, blankets, camping chairs and cutlery were not available and we had to buy ourselves. We would get that money back but that took a lot of time and energy before we finally got it. After two hours of driving, the arm of the wing mirror on the driver's side suddenly collapses, probably this arm was not fully out when we took the camper. Awkward because dangerous. The result was that the mirror flew off. Road side assistance was not for this, we were told after difficult contact with customer service. We should get it fixed ourselves. We have been in contact with various garages, judgment was: click in new mirror and done. Max 50 dollars incl labor costs, but the mirror was nowhere in stock and because we were passing through we had no time to wait for it. So we returned the camper without a side mirror. Charges Indie $400 estimated repair fee for that! They then immediately debited the entire deductible from the credit card. So now endless contact with customer service again. Everything about the chat/mail because no one can be reached by phone. Don't do it!
So are you thinking about an Indie camper? Save yourself the hassle, time and money and rent your camper elsewhere!",1
Indie Campers California,"Hello!

Although we had read a lot of negative reviews about Indie Campers, we took a chance because some reviews were positive and this company offered the kind of RV we were looking for on our trip to California. We rented a class B (Winnebago Solis) for 4 people (2 adults and 2 children 3 and 5 years old), we left Las Vegas with a return to Los Angeles.

My conclusion; I strongly advise against this company. Here's why:

1. Since we have young children, we rented with the RV 2 child car seats and I wrote to the company a few times to make sure that these would be available when picking up the vehicle in Las Vegas, I was assured that yes. When we arrived, we were given only one seat. We were given no explanation or even help. We were told to go buy a seat at our expense at Walmart and make a claim at the end of our stay to have the seat reimbursed. We were forced to transport our 5-year-old to Walmart without a car seat, which is super dangerous and also completely illegal. It started our stay badly.

2. After only 1 hour drive, kitchen tap water is used for the first time. It's completely flooding the floor of the RV. I contact the company by email (because the company does not offer help by phone), and explain the problem. Again no help, we are told that the vehicle exchange is impossible and that we have to find a place by ourselves to repair the problem (we are not even helped in our garage searches). You can quickly see by examining the RV that one of the kitchen faucet pipes is cracked, which prevents us from using water (as much faucet, toilet, shower, etc.), because the pressure of the water in the cracked pipe makes everything flood with each use. In short, we finally find a place that repairs RVs, nothing compatible with our vehicle, and finally we find a way by ourselves (with a piece of hardware) to fix the problem temporarily. All this, again at our expense and in addition, it wastes us a lot of time.

3. I could also mention that when picking up the vehicle, instead of 2 complete bedding kits (including pillows, sheets and duvets), we were only given 3 contour sheets and 3 pillows (we were 4 people), we had to buy warmer blankets because everyone was cold at night. The pipe to fill the drinking water tank was damaged, almost impossible to fill, it took a lot of time and the water flew everywhere. The grey water tank was pierced and flowing all over the land. In short, a ton of problems, the vehicle was far from in order and it is obvious that no one had done any checks before renting this RV back to someone. Moreover the employee in Los Angeles (where we went to postpone the RV at the end of our stay), told us that this RV should never have been rented as they are state.

I must say, however, that the worst part was the team on site in Las Vegas, everything was weird, the employees were so nonchalant, they really laughed at us. I found the service quite worse in Los Angeles, the person was much friendlier and seemed really sorry for us, but it doesn’t change the fact that Indie Campers is a big company that clearly has a management problem. In conclusion, I would say that this company doesn’t care about customers, it doesn’t offer any help in case of problems (I dare not even imagine hell if a more serious problem happens, like an accident). In short, I made a claim to the company, to be reimbursed for the child car seat, the rental for the car seat I had paid for and did not have, the part bought at the hardware store and for the lost time. I was reimbursed the equivalent of C$300. I find it OK, but without any more stress and inconvenience caused by their negligence, I would have preferred to have more, but hey, it’s better than nothing. In conclusion, I do not recommend, it is better to find another company if you want to spend a more relaxing and safe holiday. Hopefully, my comment can help others not get fooled and it can help the company improve and make changes. We paid 4000 Canadian dollars (for 9 nights), it is expensive and at this Award we expect much better!",1
Iceland,"We used Indie Campers and strongly advise against it:
1) We booked the vehicle months in advance and a few weeks before leaving we were greatly increased the fare. After a difficult negotiation we accepted a smaller increase although important (not serious)
2) there were hidden defects of the camper at the time of delivery (a double bed was unusable as the pieces were not suitable for mounting the bed)
3) many indie camper users (met along the way) have reported important critical issues
4) non-existent customer service (cannot contact them by phone, the message box is answered by a totally useless chatbot)
5) faced with complaints we were treated with great and embarrassing indifference.

We are strongly disappointed and do not recommend using this company: to avoid!",1
Don't choose Indie Campers,"I will start by saying I would never choose Indie Campers again and would advice that no one else choose them either.
Now I will explain why. Me and four friends hired a campervan for five people to go on a trip from Berlin to Poland. A week before the trip, Indie Campers confirmed our reservation and said we would have a four person campervan.
Of course we spent the entire week calling them to get more information from them, because obviously a four person campervan would ruin our five person trip. They kept giving us really vague answers, just telling us unless we received an email from them there was no news. We never got more information or ways to fix the situation and kept calling and emailing daily, speaking with people who didn't seem to be aware of the situation and didn't seem interested in fixing our problem. We spent a lot of money on long distance calls, plus waisted a lot of our time trying to fix the issue and came under a lot of stress.
Long story short, they gave us a four person campervan which not only was a downgrade but ruined our vacation plans mid vacation. We actually had to keep one person out of the original trip and spend a lot of money making last minute plans for him. But on top of it all, they said they would reimburse us 900€ (which was the difference between the van we had reserved and the one they gave us) and we're also having a problem with this. They never even suggested they'd make a reimbursement until we demanded it via email and still it took them over two weeks to issue it, which means that nearly a month has gone by and we still don't have the money or any sort of follow through from their part.
Frankly, the whole situation is a disgrace. If they couldn't offer the van we had asked for, they should have done something about it earlier on, plus offered some kind of assistance given we had to make so many plan changes. They could have offered we take two smaller vans instead of one, reimbursed our money right then and there so we could use it for the car we had to hire, plus tent, sleeping bag etc we had to buy as a last minute solution. Basically, they could have done SOMETHING, but did absolutely NOTHING. They don't even seem to understand there are consumer rights to take into account, and we are firmly considering suing the company because our consumer rights were not met.
When we returned the van we let them know our reviews would be very negative because our whole experience had been negative and they didn't seem to care at all. Their only answer was ""sure, we understand"".
Of course we would never consider hiring through Indie Campers again. We're strongly advising everyone we know to avoid them and would also give the same advice to anyone reading this. Don't spend your money on overpriced vans, from a company that doesn't actually care whether you get what you paid for or not. Save yourselves a lot of unnecessary stress and choose any company but Indie Campers.",1
The worst company to rent a van,"Very bad experience with Indie Campers. I do not recommend it to anyone. The treatment was null and minimal, they explained everything to us half-heartedly without clarifying VERY important information. The condition of the van was terrible. We had to make repairs during the 7 days we had it.

And be careful, because now, 2 weeks later and once they had already returned the 2000€ warranty, they are taking money out of our bank account with minimal damage that according to a local mechanic is impossible to cost 2148€ that they have withheld from my account. We are already in contact with a lawyer to deal with this case and also to file a complaint as a company for many other irregularities that have been detected by this company.
We will never travel with this company again, you should know that there are FB groups and even forums on reddit to take legal action as there are many people who have been scammed.",1
Dishonest company to flee...!!!,"The van was in poor condition and dirty when it was delivered to us. It was poorly organized, long waiting times, unclear explanations from employees. During the trip, parts fell as damaged, e.g. two windows. At check-out, they told us everything was good. Once with us, we receive an email where they say they discovered a scratch and that they ask us 2145€ of the deposit that had already been returned!!! Total cost for one week of old and dirty van: 3.895€. Anything. There are plenty of negative reviews on the web about Indie Campers who are making dishonest money. Avoid renting with them. We will try to take legal action to have them return the money they stole from us.",1
Feel like a scam - Unscrupulous staff,"We picked up our Camping car yesterday, August 17th 2024, at the Indie Camper depot (22 Rue de la Haye, 38070 Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France).

The camping car was presented to us, damaged with lights cables, cut and hanging on the outside, tape all over, dirty and uncleaned. When raising concerns on the state of the camping car, the staff told me that it was “illegal” for them to clean the outside and that I should take it with customer service. Not only the staff were unbothered and clearly did not care at all about the situation, they were also agressive.

The hanging/cut cables were stitch back together, with tape.

I asked for another camping car as this one did not feel safe and in a good enough state to be drove (not just unclean) and I was told that it was this one or no other and that I should take it with customer service. Being on holiday with two small children very happy for us to go holidaying I resigned and accepted to take this camping car.

We discover the following later …. the fridge door opened wide while driving, breaking a couple of glass bottles, it actually does not shut and we had to buy tape to keep the door closed.

The battery were not charged even though we were told they were, which means that we had to have dinner with the motor on, so we could have electricity. Also, fridge not working as a result.

The main door does not shut fully with a constant gap of lights where cold, water/rain and noise gets in.

The drains of the shower and bathroom sink are blocked, water does not go away and therefore cannot be use.

I will post pictures so visual opinion can be made.

I have contacted customer service which remains silent.

This is clearly an unethical company with untrained, unprofessional and unscrupulous staff. This feels like a scam.

With safety in mind and given the state of the interior and exterior, I can only worry about the engine/motor, the breaks and overall safety while driving this véhicule.

We have paid a total of €2833.34 for the whole trip, including full Premium insurance.

Stay away from IndieCampers if you want to enjoy vacation,"INdieCampers is the WORST camper van company! We weren't provided an electrical cord and we had no running water in our van even though the van had a kitchen and shower and sink, none of which worked properly. The worst part of this company is the assistance. They only respond and troubleshoot through email which wastes so much time when you need assistance. I would use any other company but this one. While we were on the road we met so many people who had used them once and never again. They promised us a $400 refund and they haven't done it. Based on the customer service reps who answer the phone (beyond bad) they never will refund it! IndieCampers has a very bad rating out among camper van users. Rent elsewhere if you want to enjoy your vacation! Ours was severely negatively impacted by this decision to use IndieCampers.",1
Really NOT good,"Really not good. The booking, website, design is amazing. But the moment to pick up the camper is a mess. We paid extra to pick up the van later than the working hours and no one was there. We had to do everything remotely by ourselves with someone on the phone, Find the keys hidden in a parking lot (like a scape room). And the drop off of the van really bad. V-E-R-Y rude staff.

"If you break down, they won't help!!!","Our vehicle overheated and spent 8+ hours waiting for roadside assistance. The WhatsApp roadside help line asked me to troubleshoot the problem while we were stranded on a remote highway. The customer service rep stopped responding, leaving me and my friend with no option but to drive a failing vehicle to the nearest town. Once in town i contacted whatsapp again and got a different rep. They then suggested I get the car to a mechanic, pay UP FRONT for the repairs. Only when the mechanic turn me away did the WhatsApp fellow ask for our location to send a truck. That was 8 hours ago and still have not received any information about the tow or where i am supposed to stay tonight. Zero stars if I could.",1
"If I could give this company 0 stars, I would.","I cannot put into words properly how bad our experience was with Indie Campers, but I will attempt to, and I will create points to keep it short.

- We had to wait for 2 and a half hours over our pick-up time, which made us miss our equipment hire collection time, and delayed the holiday on the first day.
- The waiting room had mould growing on the ceiling and walls.
- We had to remind them of the extras we paid for (as they had forgotten).
- They could not provide us with a wrench/spanner for the gas cylinder and told us we needed to buy one.
- There was a very unpleasant smell in the fridge of something rotting.
- The van was falling apart.
- We had to pull over as the brakes were over-heating on mountain roads, leaving our LIVES AT RISK.
- We were stranded with a broken down van, with next to no help from the customer service team.
- Their internal communication was non-existent.
- We had to pay for 2 nights in a hotel before the company had even thought about organising transport for us.
- After half the holiday spend stranded, they asked us travel 3 hours back to Venice for a new van.
- On the way back to Venice, they decided to tell us that the new van would not be ready until the day after, leaving us stranded once again.
- We turned down the new van and any more of their services.
- We did not even have one full day in the van for the holiday.
- We are now pursuing action against them.

I cannot recommend enough to stay clear of this company. There are plenty of other campers companies like Road Surfers etc.",1
total disregard,"I COME THROUGH THIS DECLARATION TO SHOW MY DISSATISFACTION AND INDIGNATION WITH THE COMPANY INDIE CAMPER'S. I BOOKED A MOTORHOME IN ADVANCE FOR A TRIP WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS.

ON THE RETURN, A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE TOGETHER WITH ME DID THE ENTIRE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CHECKS OF THE VEHICLE, VERY carefully and slowly under the sunlight, we saw together that the vehicle was in perfect condition and for this reason the company representative went into the SYSTREMA AND REDUCED THE RENTAL, AS I SAW.

I SAID THAT I DID NOT AGREE BECAUSE THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TECHNICAL INSPECTION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE HAD GAVE THE OK AND DOWNLOADED IT WITH ME. THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME BY EMAIL THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS HOW IT WORKED AND THAT HE COULD NOTHING DO ABOUT IT. I THEN ASKED HIM WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S DELIVERY INSPECTION WITH ME WAS AND WHY AT THE TIME NOTHING WAS FOUND AND AN OK WAS GIVEN? I SIMPLY SAID YES AND CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD, TAKING AWAY ALL THE CREDIBILITY AND TRUST I HAD PLACED IN THE COMPANY. A DISAPPOINTMENT.",2
"Horrible Company, do some research, they will take advantage of you any way they can!!!!","Be very cautious with this company! They will try to scam whatever money they can out of you in very unfair fraudulent business practices. I would recommend doing a short search online and you will find dozens of horror stories about this company. There is even a FaceBook page with hundreds of members who have been cheated out of thousands of dollars by Indie campers.

I actually had a great 9 day rental with one of there vans and returned it in great condition. Did a thorough investigation with their representative upon drop-off where we found no damage, he even remarked on what great condition the van was in and returned my 2000$ deposit at that time. End of story, All good. Not quite! Four days Later I receive a email saying they found damage on the van and they helped themselves to 780$ from my credit card without ever consulting me. They sent me a picture of the damage and it was extremely minor and superficial. There's no way that would cost 780$ to fix, if they even bothered to fix it. It was so minor that the representative I dropped it off with didn't even notice it. Seems like a money grab to me and there are dozens of stories just like mine. Some are far worse!! Please do a little research about this company and stay well clear of them. I wish I had!!!",1
Wring information on website / poor customer service,"Bitter sweet taste w Indie Camper. Our flight was delayed, contacted support right away to let them know and, event though the website stated pick ups where available until 6:30pm, they said if I didnt make it by 6pm I'd have to come the following day. They also stated late hours pick up was available for an additional fee, but they didnt honor that either. I requested to at least be reimbursed for the night I wouldnt be using the camper, but they refused it. Asked to talk to someone w the authority to make it ""right"" but they simply said no one is available and theres nothing I can do.
Why say pick ups are available until 6:30 pm, but then shut down at 6??
on the other hand, once we picked up the van, Francesca was great and very thorough, and when we dropped it off Antonio was also outstanding. Just wish the company was not so corporate greedy and be willing to do whats fair",2
Don't book!,"Please note: do not book!

Our recent experience of renting a motorhome at Indie Campers in Milan was disappointing and full of problems. From the beginning we were confronted with a series of inconveniences that seriously affected our holiday.

The pick up in Milan is very difficult to reach. It is an hour from Milan and there is no public transport to the pick-up location (25 minutes walk with your bags).

On arrival there was a lot of hassle and a lot of ambiguity. Chaos with unprofessional action.

Once on the way we soon noticed an unbearable smell coming from the toilet, similar to rotten eggs. This smell made us feel nauseous and with headaches for two days. Despite several cleaning attempts and the use of bleach, as advised by customer service, the smell lingered. This was just the beginning of a series of problems.

Unfortunately, that wasn’t all: a broken cabinet closure, the bathroom window didn’t stay open, at night we suffered from flashing lights in the camper, the camper’s battery didn’t fully charge (so without power almost didn’t work), the fridge leaked at high settings and customer service proved unhelpful despite repeated requests for help.

To make matters worse, the promised towels were missing, the washer fluid ran out quickly, one of the hobs did not work, and the sink did not run. The shower curtain was full of mold and the shower was full of hair.

The mosquito nets also did not close properly, allowing mosquitoes to enter. Blood stains from mosquitoes beaten to death were on the walls, the bedding smelled stale, and the engine oil was just about empty.

The camper came with insufficient amenities for the price we paid, and upon returning no one spoke English, which made communication difficult.

Given the many problems and the impact on our vacation, we wanted help and compensation when turning in. No one could help us any further and you will be sent from the locker to the wall.
Conditions were well below the norm, and the lack of support from the Indie Campers team made our experience even worse.

We DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend Indie Campers because of this negative experience and the lack of adequate service and support.

Do you want a nice holiday; do not book here!!",1
Indie Campers ripped us off,"Indie Campers have kept 449 Euros from our deposit for a new spare tyre after we had a small screw in the tyre on our 2nd last night in France. The cost of a top-of-the-range tyre for this Mercedes van is £120 plus fitting in the UK - we have exactly the same model at home. We are happy to pay for a new tyre - just not 449 Euros. The only way to contact them is via ""online chat"", no phone number to be found. My complaint was processed but the reply simply listed the ""standard charges"" which included a new tyre. This is greedy and money-grasping. Do not be fooled by the company's ""hip"" marketing and image - they have completely ripped us off and will not engage personally.",1
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IN SWEDEN !,"Customer service was the worst that I have experienced.

IMPRESSIBLE. COMPANY CHAOS. NUNCA MÁS,"On July 19, I had contracted to pick up an Atlas 5 Motorhome at the Indie campers center located next to Milan Airport.

When I arrive what I find is real chaos. All customers with angry faces. After an hour waiting. The attendant is trying to deliver the dirty caravan, no, next thing. Sir tells me you haven't been given time to clean it because the previous client delivered it at 11:30. I tell you I'm not taking the dirty caravan. As you can see in the photos the manager started washing the motorhome in front of our eyes while at the same time attending to other angry customers.

After seeing my face and after two hours I was delivered the caravan without water and without the gray waters thrown. A real mess.

On return I contact customer service and they tell me that they give me a 10% discount on the next rental. What I'm demanding from Indie Camper is that I indense myself. Obviously I do not intend to rent in this company anymore.

Maintenance of the motorhome the null. The manager told me that I had to cast the adblue haha that funny. As I saw my angry face the manager sang proving that it passed like the flies of me.

Unpresentable. I don't understand how they can treat customers who feed them like that. I spent over 2,500 euros.",1
Really embarrassing.,"We rented a van from Indie Campers in Las Vegas on June 24, 2024 and left the camper in Salt Lake on July 5, 2024
To the chek in listless and incompetent staff.
They delivered a dirty camper both externally and internally.
After leaving we realized that the gas tank was only 1/3 full.
At the first stop we were looking for the inside table but there was only the foot.
As if that were not enough they did not deliver the two sets of towels that we had requested and paid for.
One of the two requested pairs of sheets was also missing.
The camper very comfortable but not maintained.
The bathroom door and the door under the kitchen did not close, so during the journeys they slammed, disturbing the Guide a lot.
And to complete, there was no connection pipe between the equipment for draining gray water.
A disaster.
I do not Recommendation Indie Camper.",1
Avoid these scammers at all cost!,"Our experience with Indie Campers was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The van we received had no working electricity, which meant we couldn't shower, cook, or charge any devices throughout our trip. When we reached out to customer support (which is outsourced), they unhelpfully instructed us to take the van to a mechanic at our own expense.

Having purchased premium insurance, we were assured that any issues with the van would result in a replacement being delivered to us. This turned out to be false. Instead, we were told to drive back to the pick-up center, pay a new deposit for a replacement van (if one was even available), and customer support couldn’t confirm availability as they couldn't contact the property directly.

Upon returning the van, we were unjustly accused of damaging it and were charged €199 on my debit card without permission. The staff at the Rome pick-up center were extremely rude and unprofessional.

To make matters worse, we witnessed another family from Australia picking up their rental van, which had to be jumpstarted twice before they could even leave. It seems Indie Campers routinely takes advantage of international tourists.

The so-called premium insurance is a complete scam and offers no real coverage. I strongly recommend avoiding Indie Campers under any circumstances. They provide subpar vehicles and then find ways to charge you extra once you return the van. Their rental agreement allows them to charge you for nearly anything up to 30 days after returning the vehicle. Save yourself the headache and choose a more reliable rental company.",1
Don't trust this company.,"Don't be fooled by the name, they're not hip nor reasonable. They rip you off and tell you lies. Unfortunately, we had damage on the top of our van, which is not insured even if you buy the premium insurance. Indie campers charged us 2400 euros, twice as much as would be reasonable, thereby making our trip truly miserable. It overshadowed the fact that the van would stink of sewer for the first half our when we took off, while we made sure everything was emptied, and the fact that the extra kits that we purchased were far from complete.

Nasty experience.",1
Worst customer service,"This company has the worst customer service. Do not rent from them, you will regret it. I rented in Iceland and it’s impossible to reach a live person. No one calls you back. The van is old, the heater didn’t work. Terrible",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! SCAM!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ANY COST! If you did miss all the nightmeare stories other families went through with them and rented with them like we did, block your credit card right away! They will give you a beat up van that already has been damaged and will claim that you have damaged it. We returned the van with no issues, it was all clear at the check out and we received our refund back. A couple of days later we received a charge for 2865,41 Eur for damages we did not inflict! Read the contract! It says that they can charge you for any damages up to 30 days after the check out! Even after the check out went with no issues! They are a fraudulent company! Check the FB page called ''Indie campers have ripped us off'' to learn how other 1400+ people have been ripped off and scammed just like us! We are in the process of involving the lawyers and fighting to stop the injustice. This is a nightmare! SCAM! AVOID AT ALL COSTS

Sicily vacation frustrated by dismal Indie Campers service,"Today, from the quiet of my home and not from a campsite in the sun and in need of much cleaning, I will tell the story of a frustrated vacation in Sicily because of the rent of a camper.
For starters, the pick-up point is in an industrial area behind the airport that forces you to take a taxi that, despite being only 6 km away, cost 25 euros. I think it wouldn't be a bad idea if Indie had a regular shuttle, even if it was paid for. And the reason is that to go from the airport to pick up the vehicle you can take a taxi, but to do the reverse route you play it. Especially since the check-in and check-out procedures are endless and also depend on the number of customers who have gathered at the same time. If the process also has any impact, it can take hours. When I arrived there was only one person to deliver and receive. On delivery, there were two.
That said, in our case, the camper we were assigned was delivered to us just as they had surely received it: it was dirty on the outside and inside, with barely a third of fuel, the additional battery 10% and the empty water tank. We were advised that night to sleep in a campsite and charge battery and water tank. As if that were not enough, the vehicle key (only one) had a depleted battery and did not work. It was to be operated by the physical key built into the controller. We were recommended to find “a Chinese”, buy the battery and claim its amount through the company forms. Perhaps someone wonders why we admit to this whole series of breaches and that is that after almost two hours of procedures under a sun of justice, tired of the trip and wanting to start enjoying, one signs anything to get out of there.
Finally, we set off and ended up at a campsite near Lido di Noto. We arrived late at night and the recharging poles were not available so we had to wait the next morning. The night was torrid and we started to adjust the cabin to sleep. First surprise, one of the backs of the back seat that should lie down to look like a bed, did not. The switches that actuated each backrest seemed to cross at every push. Perhaps the lack of battery did not help either, but we could not start the engine at 12 pm.
We tried to mount the bed on top and we did, but it was absolutely impossible to sleep there in all the heat that accumulated.
Very soon in the morning we found a square near a recharging pole and while we took a walk to the village for breakfast, we left it charging. Before leaving, we found that the vehicle system detected that it was connected, however, after about three hours, when we were preparing to continue the route, we observed that the battery was still with 10%. We wrote to the support center by email (there is no emergency phone) to report both failures: battery and sofa bed. Hours passed and there was no answer.
Given this perspective, we decided to rent a night in a nearby hotel. In that hotel we also put the battery to charge to no avail. After three hours, it was still with 10% charge and that is not enough to activate the fridge. Since we were still unanswered we decided to extend one more night in that same hotel. And the truth is that we never received a response to the complaint.
We couldn’t and wouldn’t miss the holidays and decided to continue traveling by modifying the plan and going to hotels to sleep. As extras we had hired a butane cylinder, but since the fridge did not cool, we could not even cook for a single day and returned it intact.
The return process was also extremely tiresome. In both cases you must fill out a form of many questions in which if you do not show satisfaction you must explain the reasons. And all this with the mobile phone and in deplorable environmental conditions. Result: since we arrived, hour and a half lost. And lucky for us that we were delivering at 11:00 and the flight was at 21:30. Not like two more groups delivering with us and flying two hours later. Without a taxi to pick them up because you can't order one without knowing what time you're going to finish and one of them got complicated because of a little bump. Quite an adventure, but nothing fun.
As you have already anticipated, I have requested compensation from Indie Campers to cover my room expenses and amount to 632 euros for seven nights, duly documented plus the refund of the cost of the unused cylinder: about 50 euros. His answer: “We are studying the case, be patient.” A week later we continue with the blocked deposit and the reiterative message asking for patience.
The signed contract itself states: 5.4 The security deposit will be returned to the Traveller at the end of the Rental Period by a member of the Indie Campers staff, provided that Indie Campers determines that the Vehicle is in the same condition as it was collected by the Traveller. The person who received the van, reflected in the system the delivery without any requirement or observation and let me know. More to go! And yet, eight days later, they have not lifted the hold.
Honestly, I hope that what happened in Catania is an exception and not the rule at Indie Campers and I also hope that they choose an amicable settlement that as of today, July 18 has not yet occurred. I will continue to report because I think it is necessary these types of platforms that give voice to the user.
(I simply add a photo of the condition of the controls to raise and lower the rear backrests to transform them into a bed, as an example of the general condition of the rented camper)",1
Avoid at all costs,"Genuinely horrific to deal with. Booked a campervan to travel to the Europa League final, paid the £99 out-of-hours collection fee and confirmed my time of arrival when booking and again before I left. I contacted them again on the day of travel to confirm the pickup time and was told the depot would be closed at that time, and I couldn't collect it. This occurred on the day of travel, and despite pointing out that I had previously confirmed my arrival time and paid extra for it, they said no and stopped responding on the live chat. I then had to book an Airbnb for the night, and they refused to give me the van until 9:30 am the next day. When I arrived at the depot to collect the van, the on-site staff told me he had been there until midnight the previous night, waiting as nobody on the online team had actually checked with him depot opening times. We then had nearly a 2-hour wait to get the van as their systems weren't working. Have flatly refused compensation or a refund for anything I've paid for that they then stopped me using. Terrible sham of a company, avoid at all costs",1
Very bad experience with Indie Campers – safety neglected and no after-sales service,"Very bad experience with Indie Campers – safety neglected and no after-sales service

We rented a van from Indie Campers and, after just a few kilometers, discovered that both front tires were completely bald, to the point where the inner cords were visible – a dangerously unsafe condition for any rental vehicle.

Unfortunately, we didn’t check the tires before departure, trusting the company’s inspection process. They take around twenty photos before you leave, but fail to check the most critical safety elements – like the tires.

After contacting customer service, we were instructed to replace the tires urgently at an approved garage, which we did. Since then? Nothing. It’s now been over two weeks, and despite multiple follow-ups, we’re still waiting for a refund. We're just being passed around with no resolution.

In short: Indie Campers may seem fine if everything goes smoothly. But as soon as something goes wrong, no one is there to help.

I strongly advise against using this company – they show no real concern for safety or customer support.",1
Horrible expérience,"Dear Sir or Madam,

We rented a VW Grand California from your Olbia agency from July 1st, 2025 at 4:30 PM to July 8th, 2025 at 7:00 PM (reservation no. 530PK4) for a total amount of €1,712.56.

Upon collecting the vehicle, we immediately noticed several major issues:
• The fuel tank was not full;
• The water tank was also empty;
• The awning was broken;
• The step was missing;
• The bed mattress was simply a block of uncovered foam, which does not meet basic sleeping equipment standards.

As no alternative was offered on site, we had no choice but to take the van in this condition.

The following day, on July 2nd, the water pump started malfunctioning, running continuously without pumping, leaving us unable to use the shower, sink, washbasin, or even the toilet.

We immediately contacted your assistance service via WhatsApp. Despite numerous messages, no practical solution was offered to resolve these issues.

On the morning of Friday, July 4th, we discovered that the gas bottle (which we had paid for) was empty, even though we had barely used the stove. Faced with this series of malfunctions, we had no choice but to return the vehicle to your Olbia agency. However, no replacement vehicle in proper working condition was provided to allow us to continue our trip. Moreover, the rental agreement was closed without any documentation being given to us, despite our repeated requests.

From that point onwards, we were forced to pay for hotels and restaurant meals in order to continue our vacation until the evening of July 8th.

We have kept all the necessary evidence to support our claims, including receipts for the expenses we incurred due to these issues.

In the interest of resolving this matter amicably, we are requesting a full refund of the rental, as the contract was clearly not fulfilled.",1
Indie Campers - Ireland - Truly Awful Experience,"We rented an Atlas 5 Berth campervan for 1 week 30.06.25 - 07.07.25. The cost was in excess of €1,500 for the week. Pick up is from a rural location in North County Dublin. When we arrived we were informed we could not leave our car there, so we had to drive it into the village and leave it and hope for the best. The staff tried to push extra insurance on us by trying to frighten us if we did anything wrong to the van, they also charged us extra for a bottle of gas that we weren't expecting, they said this is how the owners make their millions! We commented that there was an awful smell of gas from the compartment and were told this is normal. We were shown around the van very quickly on how to operate it, it was an automatic, the you tube tutorial we were sent was for a manual. Once we left the site we travelled to Wicklow. Upon arriving we quickly realised the water was not working, therefore no way to wash, clean or use the the toilet, all the reasons why we booked this expensive van in the first place. The ""customer Service"" in Portugal which is through whatsapp were no help, and once we got in touch with the Dublin site, while they initially advised it was a minor fuse problem, following which they stopped answering our calls/texts. In the end we had to source 2 mechanics at considerable expense to us to fix the issue, so three days without water. The mechanic stated the water pump was broken before we took out the van and that we were the third family he had seen that week.
The awning and blinds didn't work properly either.

More importantly the smell of gas that we were told was normal got worse, we reported the issue and got no help, in the end a fellow camper who works with gas advised us it was extremely dangerous and fixed it for us. A truly awful experience all round and very stressful.

While we all know things can and do go wrong big companies like this should have people ready to respond and help fix the issues and not leave families to their own devices. We were offered a refund of €70 for the entire experience and even though we have sent further complaints we have yet to hear back. I would never recommend this extremely unprofessional, unhelpful company to anyone.",1
"No camper, no refund - stay away!","Like so many others, I'm saying Stay Away from Indie Campers. We rented a campervan, paid for premium insurance and deposit and the full trip in advance of pickup. Got to the depot (in the San Francisco Bay Area) and they informed us that the camper we'd reserved came in broken, they couldn't fix it over the weekend, and they had no substitute (many campers in the lot, he told us none of them were functional). He was very helpful and told us how to contact headquarters for a refund - they're refusing it entirely. So we were out a camper and a trip, and they're keeping the money as of they'd fulfilled their obligation.
Though reading the online reviews, as I wish I'd done previously, seems like maybe we dodged a bullet - if we'd gotten the camper, the trip might have been worse.",1
Irresponsible Company with the Worst Rental Experience,"We booked an Atlas 5 in Zurich on 4 - 12 Jun 25. Worse rental vehicle experience ever.
The awning for our assigned campervan was not working right from the start yet they assigned the van to us. We asked for a replacement but obviously there was none and we had no choice but to proceed with the rental.
Then worse was to come. The grey water was leaking from an inner pipe which was not connected to the main discharge pipe! We were wondering why the grey water indicator was 0% all the time until it was pointed out to us that the grey water has been leaking from the wrong pipe underneath our van! So obvious that Indie Campers didn’t check the vehicle at all!!
Worse was that the bathroom shower area and all the sinks choked from the second day onwards and we spent all our time plumbing and clearing the chokes!

I asked for a full refund but they offered a derisory 5% discount on the next rental, as if I would rent from them again!!

And this is how they reply;

“After reviewing your case, we noted that the pickup form you completed indicated the van was clean and that all facilities were functioning properly at the time of collection. However, we understand the inconveniences you experienced during your trip.

In line with our refund policy, we will compensate you with xxxCHF (3% of my rental) as a gesture of goodwill. Please note that this is the maximum amount we can offer in this case.”

They don’t acknowledge the issues I raised.

And by the way, Indie Camper will delete the negative posts!",1
Bad experience with indie,"The agents at Hamburg Office are excellent specifically Sara !!!!

No assistance during the whole trip is smoky this assistance by chat they know nothing and say nonsense!!! To be banned",1
Nightmare experience,"Ok where to start.
We are currently travelling in Greece with a camper from indie campers (more like SCAMpers)
We were already suspicious at pickup, but as usual, us being too naive, went with it.
There was barely a check done beforehand, but since we were with a 6 month old baby in the blistering heat we just wanted to get moving. I had to make photos of all damages myself. When I notified the rental guy about window blinds being broken, a door lock not working, I was told not to worry about it. We were immediately told to upgrade our insurance, for ""peace of mind"". Let me tell you, peace of mind is the last thing we have right now.
Despite being told the adblue was full, they clearly just filled it just enough for the light to go out. After not even 100km, the warning light for adblue started lighting up.
After not even a day, the fridge broke down. First we were told it was a common issue. Almost immediately after that, we were told they never had that happen to a customer before? After another few hours (bear in mind, there is no way to call them, just Whatsapp messages, were first you are connected to a bot, and it takes hours to get an answer) we were told it was because of the 12v battery in combination with the heat (this is Greece, it's always hot), despite it being connected to the electricity on a campsite nonstop.
So, then I asked to have it repaired. They told me to get it repaired myself and that they would reimburse be. After checking their rental agreement, nothing is written about that. The rental agreement tells you to go to a RV repair place assigned by indie campers. Nothing like that happened to us. Now they are asking me to just go buy an electric cooler and send them the receipt. This is really a joke. Furthermore, as I said before, almost all window blinds were broken, with the fixtures lying around on the floor.
We paid for tableware, that was almost all dirty when we took it out of the box they gave it in.
The gas canister, also supposedly full, was already half empty when we first used it. They also give a secondary gas canister in case the other one ""empties early"" but it doesn't even have the right connection.
I can go on and on and on about this, bur clearly it's just a massive money grab with zero respect for customers. STAY AWAY!",1
"Do not recommend, stay away","I booked through indie campers and I I promptly found out I was lied to in the booking. The host for the car I booked was actually from this other company that was advertising on indie campers and after I submitted my booking, they wrote to me and said that they don't have that car anymore or any model like that and they also don't have the heater that was advertised in the booking and that if I still want to continue with another car and no heater. After some deliberation I was ok with that since we are travelling in the summer time, but right after I agreed he also said that 'hey you know that unlimited mileage you requested is not actually unlimited, it was a bug in indiecampers site and we only offer 150 miles/night.' After that I said I don't want this booking anymore as there is already too much false advertising and I want a refund.

Now this is where the problems started, on indiecampers website it says clearly there is a cancel booking button and they even show screenshots of it, but in fact there is NO SUCH THING and you need to write to their customer service if you want to cancel. The customer service is extremely slow and even deliberately ignoring you if you pursue this. I spent almost 3 hours of my time mostly waiting and remaking the chats with their customer service in order to get my request for a refund and cancel the reservation. The first 4 chats I initiated the person on the other side introduced themselves and then did not reply anymore, I literally got ghosted by customer service. After a few tries and the following day in the morning, I finally got someone who took my request and helped me, but still it took 3 hours in total of waiting.

In the end due to false advertising on that guy's cars I lost 53 GBP due to the cancellation policy, because that's how it is. it was OT's campers if you are interested and I would not recommend either OT's campers or indie campers at all, stay away from them. If you don't believe me, read the horror stories on reddit about them.",1
Avoid this company at all costs — premium insurance means nothing to them!,"Avoid this company at all costs — premium insurance means nothing to them!

We rented a camper and paid for the premium insurance specifically to avoid being liable in case of an accident. Unfortunately, an accident did occur — and we did everything by the book. We filled out the police accident report, followed every instruction from the rental staff, and were told everything was in order.

Fast forward a couple of monyhs later: instead of handling it through their insurance (as they should have), the company completely dropped the ball and is now trying to make us pay for the damage — despite our premium coverage. They even sent a debt collection agency after us!

We weren’t at fault, we followed every step they asked us to, and we had top-tier insurance. But apparently, that means nothing to this company. Their failure to file the claim properly is now somehow our problem? Completely unacceptable and borderline fraudulent.

This has turned into a nightmare, and we’re now stuck dealing with threats and stress for something we should have been protected from. We trusted this company — and that was a mistake.

Do yourself a favor: go with a rental company that respects its customers and honors its insurance policies. This one clearly doesn’t.",1
Worst customer service in history,van had to go into the shop an hour after renting it. They would not provide a new van or a pickup. Had to cancel as we were pressed for time due to slowest customer service response in history. Had to leave the van at a dealership for repairs that would take over two weeks and now they will not refund my $500 deposit although they promised they would after 30 days. Worst experience. Avoid them like the plague.,1
"Unreliable and unable to provide solution, fingers off!","Have already rented many campers, this time unfortunately for Sardinia via Indie, all good until a few days before the trip the camper was simply cancelled without giving reasons to us..flights booked, 2adult 3 kids and before Easter hardly any alternative possibilities, the indie staff has shown themselves affected but also unable to find or offer a solution...a camper landlord should be obliged to provide replacement service in case of short-term cancellation, I also do not get the money back as a tenant if I cancel at short notice, without giving reasons. no customer orientation, dubious and untrustworthy..fingers away from the company and their cooperation partners.",1
Many problems with Indie Campers in Iceland,"I absolutely do not recommend Indie Campers in Iceland. We rented an Atlas 5 campsite for 7 days in April to go around Iceland and it has been a disaster. We had an engine failure on the second day, a leak in the fresh water tank, windows not working, armchairs cracked, the camper is not 5 people (maximum 4), we have had to refill the Adblue three times and, above all, the assistance service at check-in, during the trip and at check-off has been very bad. Plus, premium insurance doesn’t cover just anything, the fine print tells you once you get there while you’re asked to sign the contract. All this was not unlucky, during the trip we met many people who also traveled with different models of Indie Campers camper and all had similar problems, especially the engine error, which is the most serious of all. At check-off they had us waiting almost two hours because it turns out that the workers had gone on strike because they had not been paid... It looked like a company in bankruptcy.

Really, at the moment I do not recommend renting one of their campers in Iceland at all, let alone for the very expensive price they have. I think it is much better any other company of simpler and more reliable campers. However, the heating and cooking worked well for us, we were able to complete our trip and the experience we loved despite these problems.",1
Abusive cost repair,"I put a star on because I can't put less on.
We made a small dent (about 2 centimeters) in the ceiling. Despite having the premium coverage we have been charged 1,750 euros, cost totally disproportionate to the actual value of the repair.
The worker's treatment was correct.
I do not recommend that you use this rental company ha that any setback, however small, can ruin your trip and your economy.",1
SCAMMERS AND CRIMINALS!!!,"I start this review by saying PLEASE DON'T BE A VICTIM FROM THIS COMPANY. I rented their RV in Las Vegas. Nevada. My first impression was like I was walking into a homeless shelter. I got stranded in a gas station in Utah on my way to a campground. The RV did not want to start due to a defective battery (according to a mechanic who did a jumpstart)
Their customer service is below terrible, all the communication is through Wasap. After waiting hours with my wife and a 4 year old, they answered back and blamed me if by mistake I had left anything on, or put diesel gas instead of unleaded. They did not want to give me a refund for the money I spent for the jumpstart ($100) and the day that I lost going to the shop to replace the battery.
In conclusion, I wish I could know before I made the decision to rent an RV from Indie Campers.
DON'T BE THE NEXT VICTIM!!!",1
CAREFUL,"WATCH OUT. They're scammers.
With 4 days to pick up the campervan they change my pickup location. In an isolated and difficult place to get to. I can only get there by taxi at a cost around 100€ from the airport and 45 minutes from it.
The night before I get on the plane, they call me on the phone to tell me that the pickup time instead of 09:00 h., has changed at 16:00 h., in the afternoon.
They give no option with so little margin time to adjust the rhyme. We decided to cancel the trip forfeiting the amount of airline tickets
I demand the reimbursement of the bed kit, cleaning,... (100€) and the extra for premium insurance (100€) and after chatting on the web with a robot I get absolutely nothing.
You can't call them and talk in person but they can call you at any time.
Zero professionals and zero open to customer satisfaction.",1

Indie campers Marseille,"Marseille
We rented a Marco Polo from Marseille. The guy who dealt with us was lovely but the good news ended there. We had ordered fold up bikes but when we arrived all of their bikes were broken. You could have made two good ones in a few hours but they hadn’t. While it didn’t ruin our holiday it did change it significantly as we had planned to stay out of towns. The van also only had 3km of fuel in it despite paying for ‘full to full’. This ended up costing me €40 more as I filled it and didn’t need to. Only 1 of the gas hobs worked in the van. This became less important when the supposedly full gas can ran out on day 3 after boiling kettle 5 times. The water pump also stopped and I had to reset the electrics. It happened 3 times in 7 days. When we dropped it off we were told it was because it was the end of the season and everything needed repairing!!!
The van did drive ok.",1
DO NOT USE INDIE CAMPERS ICELAND,"Indie campers in Iceland my advice to future travellers is to avoid using this company. The cleaning is very poor. We had ladies dirty underwear down the side of the chair and the handbrake did not work. We reported to the company and they told us they disengage them because they freeze due to the weather, this then makes it hard to do hill starts but also makes the vehicle unsafe I’m sure that Icelandic authorities request safe road worthy vehicles on their roads and I hate to think what the insurance company would say if they knew that handbrakes were deliberately disengaged new. Overall the vehicles are generally very tired and well used and the fleet needs upgrading.",1
"Avoid this con of a company like the plague, they will scam you.","Avoid this con of a company like the plague, they will scam you.

Hired a camper in Spain, and the actual experience at the time was great.

However, 3 weeks after our return, I suddenly received an email that head office had reviewed the returns pictures, and had charged us almost £2,000 for damages.
After investing a lot of time fighting this, I even received a call from a guy at the hiring site who 100% agreed that there was no damage, and that this was clear even in the photos that head office had supplied.
Eventually, this charge was reversed, but despite promises no apology or compensation was received.

Unfortunately, we did not learn our lesson, and did not cancel the card. Another couple of weeks later, I received an email that we had incurred a fine in Belgium during our hire.

It took me all of about 5 seconds to note that the registration did not match, and this also occurred 2000km away from the hire location, when our return mileage was about 300!

Do *not* hire from this company or it will just start a chain reaction of frustration and charges.",1
big bluff,"Big bluff. Nothing interesting to report. Lots of money for buses and entrance tickets, to visit a site of modest importance.",2
Tour guide did not provide tour of interior palace as stated in viator description!,"Sintra was beautiful -loved the furnishings in the palace as compared to empty buildings in Alhambra. Overall, with what we saw, we would rate stonehedge a 2, Alhambra a 5 or 6 (but worth doing) and today's sites a 9.5.
However, our tour guide sucked today. We were all separated (Joe and Connie in one van, Sarah in one and us in one due to us booking on separate cards). We understood so no issue and it was fine getting a day to ourselves.
Our tour guide was Antonio and he had zero enthusiasm for his job. He knew his history but showed no joy doing his job. He was anxious at each stop to get to his cigarette. The other tour guides (Sarahs and Joes) were with them as they walked through the palace interior (as our tour description described) and talked about everything. Ourguide left us as we entered and told us we would see the bedrooms on the first and second floors then move on to the open area and finally the kitchen where he would meet back up with us. Very disappointing.
We are now on our drive back to Lisbon and he will not get any tip. He is a pill. In fact, we feel we should get a full or at least a partial significant refund.",2
Not a guided tour!,"Booked the Fatima day tour for Easter Sunday .We were really excited to spend this special day on this tour . What a disappointment.. The tour guide basically gave us a 15 minute talk before each stop explaining to us what we would see and then left us alone to explore each of the sites . Due to it being Easter Sunday, they ran the tour in the opposite order than they usually do stating that Fatima would be too busy in the morning, and we would need to leave it for the afternoon which was understandable… . The lunch restaurant in Nazare that the guide suggested was very good but he neglected to mention it was cash only ( we did have cash but it did surprise some of the other guests in our tour group) .. when we reached Batalha is when the guide realized that the church was closed .. I feel like this is a huge oversight on their part. as the tour operator. they should’ve known the church was not going to be open and planned for something else to do during that time . We then reached Fatima where he left us to explore . I would have liked a more guided experience . If you need transportation to and from Lisbon to the sites this is for you and if you want a guided experience then I would look elsewhere .. not the guided experience we paid for .",2
Very Disappointed,"The trip to Fatima was disappointing. Our driver's English was very hard to understand.. At Fatima he dripped us off and told us when and where to meet. None of the brochures at Fatima were in English. It wauld have been nice if he had taken the time to explain the site and point out the significance of each building. From there we went on to Obidos with very little time to walk through the town. Overall, all 4 of us in our group were highly disappointed. We did feel that a different tour guide would have made a difference.",2
The embarrassment we suffer,"On 12/03 we went to the meeting point, in front of the Hard Rock store in Lisbon, we arrived at the point at 7:40, the tour was scheduled to begin at 8hrs. The guides at 8 arrived, we accompanied our guide (I do not remember the name) who would do the tour in Portuguese, with us were 3 women who spoke Spanish, so it would be Portuguese and Spanish.
We settled in the van, in the 2 seats right behind the driver, me and Paulo, my husband, we were on a honeymoon, as I said we were already sitting and waiting to leave, when the head of the tourism agency approached the van and asked us to leave the same pq had a problem with 2 other passengers, so we did and we left the van, who was informed that because there had been a problem with these 2 customers, who spoke English, we would be allocated in another van, since the guide could not speak q 2 languages, because seiae in which we left would now be Spanish and English, could not be the Portuguese. I already in advance, before the van, q we would, get close to us, I already questioned! Is the van full?? And it was said that yes, they would have 2 vacancies, which would be occupied by us, me and Paulo, I soon began to find a lack with us, since we were early in place to pick up good places and together in the van, but we were told that we would go together, when the van arrived, there was only a vacancy next to the driver and in the last row of the car in question, it was there that we were indignant and said that we would not be separated the whole journey. Whether you take a tour, bus, van or other means, we want to have at our side the person we will interact during the trip, we will appreciate together the landscape and exchange ideas of everything we will see on the way and in the stops, that is, we will enjoy together all the time, the q we were private what took us out of the van, in which we would do the tour.
The embarrassment was not only that we were taken out of the van, as well as wanting to make it seem that we were being conoreensive, the q made the passengers of the van talk q we were delaying their ride from the new van, the q would only have the separate seats.
I wanted to cry for the way we were treated. Because we were not given a solution, for a problem they created, but two options, either go apart or not go. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.",1
Poor experience with Inside Lisbon Tours!,"First bad experience for my family in Portugal.
Tours with Inside Lisbon Tours operator is a mass production even though it is called small group tour. ~50-60 people are gathered at a meeting spot and broken into preselected groups of 8 people per minivan. Everything depends on your luck, my family of 3 were put in a group with another 5 people who couldn't speak English for a whole day. Guide (and they are below average with this operator to begin with compared to others) had to translate everything in two languages obviously slowing down the group when she could and talking about something we already passed when she couldn't. Realizing that I called operator right away since I had another tour booked through them to check if they can guarantee for us to be next time in English speaking group. They refused stating it is against their policy. Cancelled the tour right away (thanks Viator) and booked with another operator. They have a bigger much more comfortable bus (day trip with three people at the back of a minivan is not great) and albeit group is multilingual they had 3 guides, Spanish, French and English, creating much better experience at quite a bit lower price. So beware, with Inside Lisbon you may have group speaking your language or have a poor experience like me.

Sintra itself is nic, but Cascais is a bit of a waste of time. Would be much better if a tour would visit both castles in Sintra skipping Sascais (Inside Lisbon tours only one)",1
Horrible lost $200+,"I booked the tour twice and was told there was no room on the tour for me and suggested another day, (when I would be sailing to South Africa.) I lost $200 due to the “non refundable policy. No communication. Horrible service.",1
Lisbon Food and Wine,The tour operator was pleasant and knowledgeable but the tour was overbooked and we couldn’t hear what he was saying. We’re often crammed into small restaurants and had to stay outside and not be able to see. Too much alcohol and not enough about how they prepared food,2
Poor service,We were very disappointed in our tour. We paid for a full day tour but were only given a half day. We did not get to see the second palace at all. I would not recommend this company.,1
Terrible Tour Company Bad Policy,Horrible customer service no provision for Torrential rain. The day before tour we contacted operator since heavy rain forecasted for morning tour. They told us afternoon was sold out and-said too late to cancel. The day of tour-we made our way to meeting point. It was absolutely pouring and windy. We had an umbrella and rain coats but we were getting soaked. There was no way this could be even remotely acceptable to walk in. Puddles and soaking wet. We contacted operator again and were told to bad tour goes any weather. Ridiculous. If people want to walk in horrible weather all wet they can-but should be given option to cancel. TERRIBLE POLICY.,1
Worst day trip of my life,"Don’t waste your money.
This company does not care about your experience.
I was put in a Spanish speaking tour even though I don’t speak Spanish.
They said by my name they thought I could speak Portuguese which is very close to Spanish.
Guide disregarded my concerns and said he would also do the tour in English.
Spanish was spoken first and by the time he translated to English we were far past the monuments and the Spanish group would start having a conversation in Spanish so it was hard to listen to the English version.
When I asked the driver to ask them to
Keep it down so I could hear him, he replied with “how do you think I feel”? And then said that that was the reason why he asked me to sit in the front seat.
Waste of money and a day of my trip I cannot get back.
Buyer beware. Rent your own car and you’ll see it at your pace without being rushed around.",1
Too difficult,"We visited Lisbon on sky princess timing dictated we had to book the afternoon tour, which meant a hot afternoon. The tour description details that participants need moderate fitness level. I would disagree - I am 71 go to the gym each day and practice yoga daily I consider myself quite fit, . However this tour was beyond my fitness level. So I would caution anyone before booking this tour. The level of walking and standing ( no seats or rests available) while listening to the history of Lisbon was intense. Several people younger than I dropped out of the tour and I myself chose to leave before the conclusion. I think insider Lisbon should amend their fitness requirements .",1
2 languages in 1 group- would not recommend!,"Our guide Felipe was 5 star BUT the because half of our group was English-speaking and half was Spanish-speaking, he had to rush through saying everything twice. No time for questions until later (not when we were at the point of the tour when we wanted to ask them) and because he spoke in Spanish first, by the time he went through his descriptions in English, we were often leaving the area he was discussing.
It wasn’t our guide’s fault, in fact, he had to work twice as hard as the other guides. It’s the tour company’s fault for trying to save money by coming 2 groups speaking different languages instead of using 2 separate guides.
We had booked months ahead so it had nothing to do with when we booked.",2
Commercialization at its worst,"I’ll keep this short. Commercialism at its worst. Seriously! I’ve been to the Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré Shrine in Quebec. I’ve been to Lourdes in France. I have been many religious shrines that have could spiritual and up lifting. This was not it. After walking the grounds which I found expansive I found that every location ask for a donation which was fine. But I found the “gift shop” disturbing from the glow in the dark Virgin Marie’s to the wax body parts you can burn (instead of lighting candles to pray). Check out my pics and you will see what I mean.

I don’t think the Virgin Mary predicting this…",1

Is Lisbon Small-Group Portuguese Food and Wine Tour a scam?,"My wife and I signed up for a food and wine tour in Lisbon. They sent us a link with directions to meet at the Praca do Principe at 5:30. recommending we arrive 15 minutes early. In fact, we arrived at the meeting point at 5:10. There was no one there. We waited for one hour but no one showed, I tried to call and text but no response. They, of course, had my phone and e-mail address but did not contact me. I contacted them via their website and was assured that ""We're on it"" and that I would receive a response ""within 24 hours"". Dead silence. I have disputed the charge on my credit card and do not expect to have to pay for the tour. Nevertheless, they ruined our evening by making us wait over an hour and not showing up. The fact that they have not responded to my inquiry makes me believe this is a scam.",1
"Too much talking, not enough walking","Our guide was Anna. If you want an extensive wordy history lesson, she is your guide. On a 2 hr tour, we did not leave the main square (meeting point) for 45 minutes. She talked the entire time. By 1 hr later the tour was only about 25% complete, and we bailed. I have a masters degree in history and hitting people with a blizzard of words and details is not the way to convey what could be an exciting story.",2
Subpar service from tour company.,"The places that we visited were great and worth visiting. However, the tour company was not able to deliver quality service. The tour was supposed to be a small group but because they did not have enough drivers or guides they combined to groups for a total of 20 people. The tour started 1 hour late because we had to wait for a bigger bus. The tour guide was basically a chaperone and did not add anything else as a guide.
I will not use this tour company in the future.",2
Avoid this tour company if you are expecting it to be in the language of your choosing,"Booked an English tour but wound up in a group with 80% french speakers and a tour guide who spoke almost entirely in French. Completely avoid this company until they can address this language issue. Our tour guide was decently friendly and overall I would have given him about an average/slightly below average grade (the worst of my 3 portugal tour guides but still not terrible). I blame the company for forcing him into doing dual hmm language tours.

Also, we sat in the back and the van’s ceiling is too short for someone my height (6’2). Kept hitting my head on the low roof and the van was extremely hot in the back. Up front the guide was speaking entirely in french with the french half of our “small group tour” and really didn’t engage us in conversation the entire day (thats ok because we’re introverts so didn't mind) but would have liked for some input on air conditioning and proposing an alternative seating arrangement so taller people could have space (seemed unsafe as each bump I nearly broke my neck on the roof).

We would have been better off taking a direct trip from Lisbon to Obidos as it was the highlight of the trip.",1
"Great guide, vegetarianism ignored","I was going to score 4, as the guide was brilliant (Martin), but then it dawned on me, the word ‘Food’ in the title and the price

Martin was brilliant. Knowledgable, effervescent, keen to answer all questions, and clearly adored his job. MARTIN WAS EXCELLENT

Not all the food stops were great, but on the whole you got several ‘small plates’ throughout.

My partner is vegetarian though, and I made this clear at booking. In essence this was not prepared for, and ‘ad-hoc’, “oh just eat the cheese bits’ was how his was managed. Specifically at the final food stop, which had clearly taken a large chunk of the price of the tour, at a fairly high-end restaurant with its own guide provided.

At this restaurant, zero alternative was offered, so she sat with a sardine , 2 pieces of sausage, and cheese in front of her.

This was very shirt-sighted in 2024, and a huge surprise in such a broad minded, food friendly city as Lisbon

Guide - 5*
Food - 1*

= 2*",2
not doing it is just bad,"disappointment this tour, despite the very enthusiastic guide, this is absolutely not recommended. Food and drinks are seriously substandard and an insult to the beautiful dishes and ingredients they have in Portugal",1
Would like to have more food tasting,"Leslie was great and made it really fun. The walking wasn’t too hard, area was fairly level.
Food wasn’t good. We wanted to get a taste of Portugal food and got a piece of cheese at one stop, cod cake at another stop, pork sandwich at another stop, pickled sardines at last stop.",2
Very bad,I've done a lot of trips with them and for once I'm forced to change the destination for serious work reasons they make me pay the penalty... terrible,1
Buyer became.,"I struggled to rate this because my poor rating isn’t about the locations themselves, but the actual tour. Specifically, the guide and the amount of time at each stop.

While I loved each location, the tour doesn’t allow you enough time to truly appreciate each stop. If you’re looking to just stop, take a couple pics and say you were there, then that’s what this is. In Óbidos, I didn’t even go in to a single shop or buy anything, because it only allowed time for me to walk from one end and back to the meeting spot. Nazare is the only spot where we had enough time to eat, but pretty rushed and, again, no time to even visit any of the shops. I was very disappointed at Fátima where I didn’t even have enough time to visit the shop or even pick up a candle.

It’s simply too many stops to do in one day unless you are okay with just touching and leaving.

My MAIN complaint and reason for the poor rating is with the DRIVER/Guide. He drove way too fast. 140 kph (90mph) the entire way … it was raining heavily that day and made absolutely no modifications to the speed even though every single digital sign advised so. I was sitting on the passenger side, so I know for a fact the speed he was going and when I asked him, he said he was driving the legal speed which was not true. When I asked if he could adjust it a bit, he looked at me and said he does this drive every day and knows how he needs to drive. I politely told him that I don’t doubt that’s true on other days, but today’s conditions were different. He made no modifications and continued to pass every single vehicle on the road with the exception of 2 sports cars with equally irresponsible drivers I’m sure. He failed to consider the enormous responsibility he has on his hands, the lives of 8 others, one of which was a toddler, and another an elderly recently retired couple. A complete irresponsible decision. It made what should have been an enjoyable day to a terrifying experience that I was tempted to just get off and figure out how to get back to Lisbon on my own. Not knowing how easy or hard that would be, I felt trapped. I had read a similar review before booking this tour and dismissed it thinking it was just someone that’s overly nervous. Now I realize they were not exaggerating at all and I would definitely not recommend this tour to anyone. Nothing is worth placing your life in unnecessary risk.
You can easily just take the bus from Lisbon to Fatima or any of these places without a guide that basically just tells you things you can easily research on jour own.

Second complaint: the driver flat out LIED. Our first stop was Fatima and before arriving he asked each of us, if we planned to buy any religious items, and, if so, he would stop at a store which would be the only chance we would have to but anything because there is no other shop at the actual destination stop. So, I felt compelled to buy my items at that store. Only to find out later that there is, indeed, a store at the basilica (the actual catholic shop). One of the other passengers mentioned it as we were leaving Fatima, so too late for me to even go to it. I find it hard to believe that the driver doesn’t know this and makes me wonder if he gets some kind of commission from the store he stopped at … in retrospect, I found it odd that he was standing at the register while I was paying. Especially, when I had made it obvious that I was very unhappy with his irresponsible driving and wasn’t engaging with him in any way, shape or form during the drive.

I will admit that the return drive was a lot better. It wasn’t raining, so the speed wasn’t so much a problem for me then and he became much nicer (maybe because he remembered we would be rating).

But, Buyer, beware.",2
Terrible operator who totally ignore me and unresponsive,"I think the operator lack flexiblity. I was not feeling well and ask for a change of date to the tour. They did not even reply me after I pm the operator . I understand I should have informed earlier but I was really not feeling well at the night before due to jet lag . Being a day tour operator , I think there should be some flexible in this . I did not even ask for refund.
I find it unprofessional and lack of ethic . I would request all to not go to this operator. They ignore my request and was not reasonable. It was a terrible experience
I hope the operator can please contact me",1
Great guide but over priced for what you get,"We had a great tour guide was a pleasure to be with her however the overall experience was extremely dissapointing for the price that you pay. We didnt even have the traditional desert which should be a must in our opinion. Choices of food not impressive at all and small portions. Example : Cheese tasting was just one square of cheese !
Its a pity cause guide was really nice but just not worth the money",1
very bad organisation,We were due to leave at 8.30am for a full day trip. Text message at 7am to say tour guide sick and trip cancelled. They really should have a back-up plan for one sick tour guide. It was the last day of our trip and we'd filled in the other days so nothing left to do.,1
Total waste of time,"Very average and disappointing having been on 11 different street food tours over the years this is the only one we didn’t enjoy everything was average and 3 of the stops terrible from cold food tasteless food it would of been 0 from 5 if the last 2 hadn’t just saved it our Chilean guide tried his best for what was he had to work with .
Save your money and do your own",2
ALONE CAN BE DONE,"Absolute disappointment. Due to the large number of sights, we had booked a German-speaking guide. When we were picked up, only a friendly guide showed up who knew nothing and could only speak English. Fortunately, the cancellation was fairly straightforward. We did the tour on our own with a few reservations and almost 2 hours late and can confidently say that it was worth it this way too. It must always be mentioned that these are absolute tourist hotspots and are accordingly overcrowded. Worth seeing, but make sure you have time.",2
Waste of time,Obidos was a wonderful place to visit; needed more than 45 minutes though! The rest of the trip was a laboured waste of time. Not enough time for lunch- we had to leave the restaurant after waiting 40 minutes as the waiter could not commit to serving us within an hour - not a real cristisum of the tour except that we were left at a busy time to choose our own restaurant in Nazare which was already overloaded with tourists! Just enough time for ice cream,2
Deplorable,"Very poor organization, too much pollution linked to pollution!!!!!
In short, we didn’t see anything because there was so much waiting!",1
Tour stranded a solo traveler,"Bus driver refused to pick me up then left the pickup area without me even though I was in the park and couldn’t find them, something I communicated with the tour operator several times. I found myself alone in a park early in the morning (only 5 minutes after the pickup time) so I took an Uber to Sintra and had a lovely—and cheaper—day to myself. Skip this tour and take the Uber, it’s quick and convenient and you can spend time at your leisure at more sites than the tour brings you to. Buy the tickets to Sintra online like I did. And you won’t have to wait in line if you show up at or a little after your schedule time slot.",1
Bilingual tours are not well structured and awkward.,"The itinerary fails to tell you that you wont be spending some free time on some of the main attractions of the Sintra park. It is ONLY the palace even though nearby theres a lot to see.

The tour is most often bilingual so you will have to be lucky to get a guide that can smoothly switch between both languages. Mine spent 80% of the time on the language that we havent selected until we complained.

Lack of microphone for the tour guide made things difficult too since the Sintra palace is pretty tight while walking the corridors and there's a lot of people.

If you choose this tour, you will be giving up some precious time in Sintra park. If you dont have time its fine, but we decided to abandon the tour group since it was uncomfortable for us to be together because of the language barrier and also we would miss most of Sintra. Specifically the mouros ruins.

Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the tour provided us 80% refund since we abandoned it, so at least customer service took responsability. Would not recommend though.",2
Do not open tickets on mobile phones!!!,"We booked tickets in advance. Once we got there, we couldn't open the tickets on our phone - we had to buy new ones!!!!!!",1
It's not worth it!,"Very bad. There is no clear information for transfers. All very expensive. Bad organization.
It can easily be avoided.",1
Tour driver/guide was terrible !!,"Most boring trip, the guide behaved like a cab driver. He never made any efforts to share some facts and the group of 6 were always on their own. One couple was always late and finally the driver gave them the notice after 3 attempts.

I asked him to tell them in the very first place after coming 30 mins late and he ignored. He didn’t even want to suggest where to eat for lunch. He felt he would be accountable if it something was not good. Spike more in French than english.

Moreover, the places were not worth visiting for 1 hour stop. Seeing some dead places wasn’t worth and the so called tour guide took it to another level.

If you want to save money, consider going on your own to the places and spend some quality time.",2
Bad experience with Carlos,"Bad experience with carlos, he didn’t do much for us and refused to answer my questions. I felt as if I was a burden to him on the tour by just existing. I was very uncomfortable and the others on the tour noticed his attitude towards me as well. Lastly, They didn’t show us all the things advertised in the pictures which I was upset about because I specifically booked the tour for the other sight",1
They won't hold themselves to their word. Avoid,"When they tell you you'll get to visit a palace and the beautiful town and you get 15 minutes in town and denied entrance to the palace they still refuse to refund you even when the guide says you'll get a full refund. There are plenty of other tour companies that give a similar offering, choose them instead.",1
Verzichtbar,"Der Guide war gut und nett, die Tour selst ein Witz. Die Gruppe war mit 18 Leuten keine kleine Gruppe und die Locations und die erhaltenen Tastings eer ein Witz, dann lieber etwas mehr Geld verlangen und das bieten was man verspricht.....",2
mala,"El tour es aburrido, son muchas horas arriba del carro, no vale la pena, el guía Rui hablaba mal español, no se le entendía bien. Nazaré no tiene sentido ir, es solo una playa y Fátima a menos que seas muy religioso es muy aburrido. Además llegaron tarde a la hora del encuentro por la mañana.",1
Un authorized charges,Did not book this tour. Booked a private tour and was charged for 2 different tours. Disputed the charge and TripAdvisor said I needed to dispute with my credit card company. Terrible customer service. Will never book anything through them again.,1
Poor Trip,"We were supposed to visit Pena Palace in Sintra. Due to strike the Papalce was closed. We were only mentioned this at the time of boarding, with no option of withdrawing. We were directed to see Regaleira palace. The driver dropped us off at the parking lot. We were not provided with any tickets (which other tour groups were) and there was no one to guide us through the important events related to the palace. We wondered around on our. We started the tour at 8:00 am and lunch was at 2:45 pm. It was a total waste of time and money.",1
Cancellation and not acknowledged,I booked this and paid for the tour. Unfortunately I had to cancel via trip advisor as the cruise ship we were on came in later than the start of the walk. On the day of the tour the company contacted me as had not received cancellation. Very disappointed as no refund provided,1
Not a good experience,"Guide was very friendly, but for an English language tour, his English was not very good or fluent. Also when we stopped he didn’t tell us where restrooms were located or stay with the group for explaining sights.",2
Just go to restaraunt for good local meal,"Marta was our guide and save your money and just go have nice meal somewhere. First stop was a small piece of cheese and a shot glass of port. Second stop a shot glass of the cherry liqueur, (could have bought for $1.50 euro) second stop in very crowded bar, small glass of very sweet green wine and fried cod cake ($3.75 euro,) then a pork sandwich that was good with small glass of beer and then to a restaurant definitely set up for large groups because they had back room with tables set for 20, one piece of cheese, 2 small shrimp, a roll, very pices of sausage and olives. No great info, very boring and again just go to any of the markets, etc and spend your money there.",1
Décevant,"Visité hors saison. Il faut déjà payer l'entrée, à laquelle on ajoute le prix du bus (plus de 12 euros par personne) pour faire le tour des sites de Sintra + 3 euros pour prendre la navette du bas du parc du palais jusqu'au palais.
Une fois arrivé tout le monde à la quête leu leu et c'est parti. On se suit les uns derrière les autres comme des moutons, tour le monde au même rythme le long des guide files et des plexiglas. C'est mal fichu, presque oppressant. L'intérieur est sans intérêt l'extérieur amusant tout au plus mais en assez mauvais état. Je ne recommande pas ce site. Privilégiez le palacio nacional bien plus chic et la visite plus douce et sans contrainte.",2
Don’t do this one unless you like to stand rather than walk.,"This is not a walking tour! It is a standing tour. Beware that this guide was not even aware of the pain of standing on the stone walkway in the same square never moving for well over one hour. Horrible experience and yes, I eventually needed to walk, so after two hours of standing and barely moving, I left.",1
Unfortunately disappointing,"I am a bit confused by all the positive reviews (the main reason I booked this trip), maybe we just got unlucky. To be clear, the places that we visited were stunning, especially Cabo da Roca, but the tour itself was lacking... a guide. The Pena Castle should be interesting, but we were rushed from room to room with no explanations and no time to read the descriptions. In fact, we were trying to listen to the stories other tour guides were telling to their groups. Then we were dropped off at Sintra for ""free time"" again with no explanations (just the info when we will be picked up). The Cabo da Roca was fine and we were provided plenty of time to take pictures and enjoy the views, but again no explanations. Finally (at the risk of sounding like a broken record), our final stop (2 hours free time in Cascais) was the same. I do hope that today was just a fluke, but cannot give this tour a good rating.",2
Horrible & Hungry,"We have done many food tours across the world but this was by far the worst. It isn’t even worthy of being listed by TripAdvisor as a food tour. This 3 hour tour was only 5 stops total, and one was only a shot of alcohol. To start, we notified the tour in advance that my daughter is vegetarian and they told us that they accommodate her, but that was unfortunately not true. 3 of the 5 stops were focused on meat, and at each of the stops, the guide would come over and ask her if there was anything currently available that she wanted to eat. There should have been some thought or planning done in advance. The options for her were sad looking pastries or a plate of carrots unrelated to the dish we were trying. Overall the limited food we tried was good but was limited and was missing, at the least, a sweet element. Since Portugal has so many famous pastries and desserts we were hoping to try the famous pasteis de nata. Since it was only 5 stops, it wasn’t overall that much much food. Our last stop was supposedly a dinner which consisted of a few shrimp and sausage. It was simply a tasting of a few pieces per person spread out on a restaurant table top - it was pathetic. The vegetarian substitution for my daughter was a plate a frozen peas and carrots. Also pathetic.

Also, the locations she chose were extremely crowded and some members of the group had to separate and stand outside. The people that stood outside didn’t get to hear any of the information provided by the tour guide. The tour guide also wasn’t good at talking to the whole group at once. When someone would ask a question she would only answer that person and not share the information with the whole group.

At the last stop on a food tour you usually get to ask all of your questions and get some recommendations but instead she disappeared into the kitchen for 25 minutes and then talked to one man in our group for the rest of the night.

After the tour we went and had dinner. Worst food tour ever!",1
"Insight Vacations Country Roads of Portugal ""Don't even think about it!""","This tour was very badly organised and shoddy. A couple of examples:
In Lisbon we were supposed to see where the Portuguese tarts we made (that was the inference in the brochure). In fact after visiting Jerónimos Monastery we went to a grassed area across the road and were handed a Portuguese tart each from a cardboard box! Then we went across to the river where there were a couple of toilets and a very long queue in the sun and no shade! We found other options after leaving the tour and staying in Lisbon for an extra week.
It's an eleven day tour and on two of them we didn't get into our hotel until 8pm.
The Algarve: no time to see much at all.
The meals we had were all very poor generally and the initial get together meal was a coach ride away to a run down area with weeds everywhere and a view of the river if you had a good pair of binoculars.
I could go on but to summarise it was dreadful and my advice would be forget this tour, base yourself in Lisbon, Porto and Evora for a few days each and take local trips.",1
We regret having booked this tour,Really bad experience. Guide just dropped our family off at sights and did not spent time explaining what we are looking at. Do not recommend this tour company . Wished we would have done a walking tour.,1
Not sure this is a normal experience for this tour company,"We were so disappointed. Wanted to love our tour through Lisbon, but it was far off from what we expected.
The Tuk Tuk was uncomfortable for a 4 hr tour. Every hole in the road caused discomfort. Unfortunately our guide seemed burned out and put 0 effort into our experience. He stopped at sights and told us to get off and walk around. He just waited for us to come back. Most of the time without any explanation about what we are looking at . We got more disappointed as the tour went on. Thought a few times about just walking away. Paid lots of money for a tour we could have done on our own. We all feel like we know nothing about Lisbon. We have done many tours across the world but never did we feel so „alone“ especially in a private tour ! Miguel seems like a nice guy. Maybe did not have a good day. But it sure impacted our day in Lisbon",1
Poor communication and effort by Tour company,"Having booked I Tour You day tour to Sintra, Cabo de Roca and Cascais months ago, arrived in Lisbon and advised tour had been cancelled by company with 24 hours before departure.",1
Last-minute cancellation,"Last-minute cancellation without any explanation! This ruined our plans, we had to go on our own and wait in endless queues.",1
Last minute cancellation for undue cause,"They canceled on us last minute. They cited a strike starting the day before our tour, but we were able to go on our own that day without any striking. They also said that it was World Youth Day and there would be traffic constraints, but that didn't impact our ability to get there whatsoever.

While I understand cancellations have to happen, it would have been nice to be given more accurate information in the cancellation message, to try to accommodate alternative plans (like going the day before), and for it to not be so last minute.

For what it's worth, we actually had a really pleasant time going on our own. It was easy to get there, we got there early to avoid the mad rush, and we were able to hike around the area to explore the different sites.",2
Must take 112a ride to the Castle next time...,"Warn that you climb 500 feet in Elevation, straight up in 10 minutes. I was taken away in an Ambulance. Tour Guide was great, and helpful.",2
Very negative,"After waiting for more than hour at meeting point, I received email stating that the tour is cancelled. This impacted my entire plans. They didnot bother to call and despite I contacted no answer. I don’t recommend at all",1
Unreliable,"Never got to experience this tour because it was canceled by the tour operator without giving any reason. Very, very disappointed.",1
Agressão do dono Fernando Pereira,"I just don't give 0 because it's not even possible.
I was just coming in. It was going to be my first experience at this disco. I was trying to go by to get a drink with a friend, to what I'm stuck, separated from her and held by the wrists by a man. This man was clearly under the effect of drugs because otherwise he's just a complete trustee. He tried to grab my wrists several times, left marks on my arm. A lot of people had to get ahead because he was visibly altered and I must be less than about 30 years old than he and I am a woman. When I was able to get back to my group, we were approached by a security who sent us out there. We were upset and confused, realizing that we were expelled from the disco because I was assaulted. Because whoever attacked me was the owner of the disco, Fernando Pereira. An unusual shame (of him, clearly). I hope he finds the psychiatric help he so needs.",1
The worst experience,"The worst experience even at lisbon night. We were a group of 6 people, everyone payed 15 € to enter, after 30 of frustrated harassment from the bar owner to the man's we were invited to quit.",1
Awful,"The worst and most traumatic experience I had, the person who let everyone in rejected me for not being Portuguese, claiming that I spoke the language well, pushed me out of the waiting line saying that I could complain to the police if I wanted. . Definitely the worst and only terrible experience I had in Lisbon.",1
Experiência Negativa,"Depois de esperar horas na fila vendo o segurança passar conhecidos dele na frente das outras pessoas, fui questionar a postura dele e ele disse que caso eu quisesse entrar eu teria que pagar 300 euros pra ele. Ou seja, o que era pra ser uma noite divertida foi bem ruim, houve uma tentativa de extorsão em tom de ameaça. Com certeza não recomendo o local.",1
A waste of time,"The gardens have so much potential but as a result of a lack of funding not worth visiting. There are an amazing variety of plants and trees (most of them not identified) and no map to take you around the most important ""exhibits "" in the garden. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.",1
"Disappointed, no love taken","Very disappointing! Not worth the €5pp unless it’s a donation to get some work done to the gardens!! The pathways are very rough, stones and potholes. Wear good walking shoes!
The water features are full of algae and moss.
The gardens are not looked after, overgrown and full of leaves!! No maintenance done!

There are not many markings telling you what the plant/tree are or where they are from!!

No map!! No wheelchairs as it’s very hilly and rough rocky pathways!!",1
A little disappointing,"Rather disappointing, this park is poorly maintained, especially the part with its small wooden bridges.
Nice even to take a plant-based break there.",2
Garden,"I visited on a Sunday morning in December and didn't pay for a ticket, otherwise I would have been crying over the money I spent. Not worth it!",2
A shame,"This is the worst botanical gardens we have ever been to, it was so sad and disappointing. Except for the entrance everything was left to rot away we must have been in and out in 10 minutes.",1
Laissé à l’abandon,Ce parc possède un énorme potentiel cependant il est très mal entretenu. Un bon nombre de végétaux est malade. Certaines allées sont inaccessibles par manque de taille. Les retenues d’eau sentent mauvais car non curées. Les fabriques sont toutes en mauvaises états. A fuir si le parc ne fait pas une profonde rénovation.,2
"Would be OK for free, but not for 5€","5€ entrance, everything is ""under renovation"", although I dont believe they are actually working on _anything_ there. The cactii area is a freaking joke. No one has done anything there for months.
Lots of peacocks and a few nice trees make it good, but there was basically only 1 tree with a color other than green in there.
They close at 17:00 in March.",2
Very large garden but with practically nothing DA do or see (and admission is also charged...),"Being located in the upper part of Lisbon makes a few visitors come, but honestly it's not worth it. Admission is charged and inside there is nothing special, except a few plants and a dirty pond. I recommend going elsewhere",2
Disappointment,Poorly maintained and impassable garden with stroller. No signposting. This is a shame because there are spectacular trees not highlighted.,2
Avoid!,"That, a botanical garden??? A shame! The Chernobyl power station is better maintained than this wasteland. To avoid (especially as admission is for a fee)",1
Botanical Gardens Lisbon,There were quite a few issues with the gardens. There was a queue to buy tickets from a small office. The waiting was unacceptable. 4 staff but only one serving. The gardens must have been pleasant once. Found them run down and untidy. The toilets had not been cleaned for sometime. The little caravan to buy drinks from only takes card which is ridiculous for a 2 euro bottle of water.,2
Not a great experience sadly,"The overall impression that I got from our visit was one of neglect. The walkways were treacherous in places and many of the plants appeared to be in poor shape. The water features looked stagnant and unpleasant. Quite disappointing really. The paths are very steep in some parts which we were only told about after we had paid for our tickets. Not really suitable for anyone with walking problems.

On the plus side it wasn’t very crowded. There was only a relatively short queue to get in when we arrived but the queue moved incredibly slowly as there was only one person issuing tickets, largely due to the fact that the ticket office was only big enough to allow two people in at each time!

Overall, not really worth the effort getting there.",2
Not worth the money … paths are treacherous,So poorly maintained….paths are broken and treacherous…. Planting overgrown on the paths … areas sectioned off and building materials just left on the paths. Water feature waterfalls dryas a bone and full of winter debris.,1
Little interest,Poorly maintained garden-No plan to be located inside the poorly referenced garden-plants or not at all closed botanical museum without being informed at the entrance although we are allowed to pay the entrance of the museum!,2
Poorly maintained sad garden,"You are better spending the €5 somewhere else. The gardens are poorly maintained, with large sections blocked off. The garden beds are dry and unmulched, and many of the shrubs need proper pruning. The plants are not all labled. The paths are in need of repair.
Ponds are full of sludge. If you are a plants person, you can only be disheartened. The only staff I saw were those collecting money. Where are the gardeners?",1
Fine garden for the rest but...,"In itself it is a beautiful garden with a wide variety of trees and plants, and oasis of peace in what is otherwise quite a busy neighborhood. It's a nice place to stay and I can see myself reading a book. However, if you have to pay the full entrance price then accommodation such as a toilet, a terrace where you can have something fresh, etc. has been welcome. Moreover, the ‘sensory garden’ and some taps that could give the whole a bit more cachet were not in operation. It was good but not enough.",2
Access badly lets the gardens down,"Wonderful nature in the heart of the City. However pathways can only be described as dangerous. Holes, uneven surfaces, loose stones, steep, all unsuitable for anyone with a walking problem, push chairs and wheelchairs. It’s a shame as it obviously desperately needs money spent on improvements.",2
No point!,Very disappointed! To avoid! Gardener certainly on holiday!!! What is the 6€ paid by each visitor? Some interesting trees!,1
Outrage,"holiday masters and we came to spend the day in Lisbon. My partner really wanted to visit the Botanical Museum. We travel with two pets. We have accessed the enclosure and as you enter before buying the ticket there are some bathrooms and a staircase where I have stayed with the bitches while my wife bought the ticket to enter herself, because we knew in advance that pets cannot access and I understand.
Two operatives approached me to ask me out, telling me they couldn't be animals there. Museum rules. They have always been very friendly and polite.
I have spoken to them for a while giving my opinion and claiming that I do not UNDERSTAND how it is possible that right at the entrance of the compound where there is no garden you can not wait for your companion, while she makes the visit. Unfortunately.",1
Bad experience,"Very neglected place.
Could be nice park, but no one takes care about this Garden.
Roads and paths, specially steps , are just dangerous to walk.
So many dried trees, almost no flowers.
Definitely not a place to visit in Lisbon, where are so many free and nice parks and gardens.",1
A lot to do,"Unfortunately, a space with a flora with many possibilities and is very neglected, from flora to roads and sculptures.
Charge €4 to those over 65, without any information.
A garden that besides already some signs on the plants, there is no guide of paths or signs for the visit",2
Toilet!,"Unfortunately, we were unable to enjoy the garden. The search for the second toilet (despite the sign) proved unsuccessful because it was closed!",1
Disastrous,"Without a doubt the most neglected botanical garden I have ever visited.
Dirty, neglected, with nothing good to highlight unfortunately.
It's not worth paying to enter, especially €5.
It's been very sad to see how it is",1
Garden,"How can you pay to see this???
Decadence, carelessness, bad treatment, a shame! I won't pay to see this again, shameful!",1
Needs some TLC,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this botanic park is underwhelming. It looked a bit neglected and compared to botanic parks in most national centres was disappointing. Having said this, for the €5 fee it’s a nice bit of shade and greenery and many visitors could be seen lying down relaxing in the shade of the trees.

It is located on the side of a hill and you enter at the top of the hill reasonably assuming you can walk down and exit from the bottom of the park. Be aware that the exit at the lower part was closed/under construction so you have to climb back up the incline to exit the park the way you entered. Not recommended for those with any physical limitations.",2
A real disappointment and an unjustified entry fee,"As confirmed by previous reviews that we read before entering, the botanical garden is absolutely not worth the visit, much less the 10 euro entrance fee. Unfortunately, the variety of plants takes second place compared to the lack of care, if not even the abandonment that reigns almost everywhere... Too bad!",2
Little to see here,"This shouldn't be confused with the actual Jardim Botanico Tropical in Belem which is lovely!

This is a small park with many trees and a few flowering shrubs. There are gardens on the upper level but they aren't at all well kept and the whole place has a slightly derelict air. The pond was neglected and full of algae.

There are many beautiful parks and gardens in Lisbon where you can walk and rest free, so I wouldn't waste money paying for entry to these ones.

However there is a very nice ice cream shop across the road - Niva Cremeria Gerlateria Italiana - that's worth a visit!",2
Giardino abbandonato - ne sconsiglio la visita,Visitato a Giugno 2023. Ne sconsiglio la visita. È un giardino abbandonato. Le farfalle non ci sono. Il giardino all’italiana è dismesso. Meglio impiegare il proprio tempo a Lisbona per vedere altro.,1
A dull garden not worth paying to see,"As Botanical Gardens go, this one is dull and not worth the entrance price. It is no more than an arboretum. Nothing is explained. There is no theme. It isn't especially attractive. I think it is one to miss.",2
"Jardin à l’abandon, aucun intérêt.","Compte tenu de l’état du jardin, faire payer 5 € par personne frise l’honnêteté.
Le seul intérêt est de profiter de l´ombre des arbres.
Mais, les travaux aux alentours ne permettent même pas un peu de calme..
Nous avons préféré en rire et au final, on se souviendra de ce parc.",1
Decepcionante,"El único atractivo son algunos árboles realmente espectaculares por su tamaño, pero en general esta bastante descuidado , no creo que se debería cobrar entrada por esta visita",2
Déception,"Nous avons été déçus par cette visite, ce jardin devait être très beau il y a longtemps mais souffre d'un manque d'entretien flagrant.
La collection botanique n'est pas du tout mise en valeur, c'est vraiment dommage.",2
Ungepflegt,"Sehr ungepflegt und keinen Eintritt wert. Besonders der Mann der die Tickets kassiert hat, war sehr unfreundlich und schlecht gelaunt.",1
Don't waste your time,This really is a sad excuse for a botanical garden. Better to Spend your 5 Euros on an Espresso & Pastel de Nata. Mirkwood without the charm.,1
Che tristezza,"Un posto mal tenuto, mal curato ed abbandonato a se stesso. Pensavo fosse un’ottima soluzione per un bambino invece sono stati 10€ buttati al vento! Lasciate perdere",1
Not worth the money,"This garden was underwhelming. There are relatively few plants - mainly trees - with lots of repetition. Some of the plants seemed on the verge of dying, such as the cacti near the entrance. The place seemed generally neglected. There was no evidence to suggest that the state of the park was as a result of some sort of experimentation, such as rewilding.",1
Worst playground ever,"What idiot thought it would be a good idea to cover the playground with pebbles?? It’s impossible to take in a pushchair, difficult to run after your child and god forbid if your child falls, they’ll get scraped up!
My daughter was wearing sandals and kept getting stones in her shoes (as was I!) , so she took them off, but couldn’t run and had to walk carefully, because the stones kept poking her feet. Then I saw other children throwing handfuls of stones and each other and another group of kids throwing stones on the slide, so when my daughter tried to slide down, she couldn’t because it was covered in stones. Absolute rubbish! I definitely wouldn’t recommend this place.",1
Unspectacular,"There was nothing to see. It’s not even a park, just a couple of dead plants and an artificial pond. Not worth visiting. Very disappointing.",1
Disappointing experience.,"We visited the park as information indicated that it included a selection of games dedicated to mathematics. We had details of a route to follow through the park which indicated where these were. We struggled to find some of them and those that we did find were covered in graffiti/vandalised/unkempt.
The park might be nice for walking dogs, jogging or sitting on a sunny day, but overall our impression was that it was unkempt and the mathematics trail not worth a visit.",2
Underdeveloped garden area near Belem Lighthouse,"Jardim Do Japao is a park area situated between the Museum of Popular Art and the marina just before reaching the Belem Tower. Here you find an open field of grass with planted trees that are not yet tall nor mature so little shade on offer. The park backs up against the Belem Lighthouse, a minor attraction in the area.

There are food trucks, stalls and little pop ups along the promenade in front of this park that make for a good place to stop for a bite to eat. Otherwise, not much reason to visit specifically. There are much larger and interesting parks and green space around Belem than what you will find here.",2
Lack of information to the public,Unfortunately with a lot of sadness this closed for more than 3 days and the citizens do not even get information of its reopening whoever goes and subjected if you hit it with the face in the door nothing of pools,1
Lawn Chairs Forbidden,Wonderful garden except that they don’t allow personal lawn chairs. If you can’t squat on the ground (like me) you are out of luck. This policy seems to have no rhythm or reason. If you are there for an outdoor performance be prepared to sit on the ground. The few benches in the park are not sufficient. Signage is also dismal.,1
if you are desperate,"Dont expect too much. There is a tiny area that is nice to sit, the rest is surrounded by either an ugly building or car noise. The gras is completely full with duck sh*t, so it's even hard to sit there.
By far not the best park/garden I have seen but there are hardly any other options either.",2
Disappointing and distressing. No visit to the zoo with a clear conscience,"This zoo is more than just getting old! I'm sorry, but I can't recommend a visit here with a clear conscience. Apart from the fact that the price of admission for what is offered is almost cheeky, in the end I really felt guilty about some animal species that are kept there.
Run-down, loveless enclosures with animals, which show practically all obsessive-compulsive disorders. We then skipped the dolphin show altogether in order not to have to watch this torment. In hindsight, I am ashamed of the visit and would therefore encourage everyone to consider supporting this zoo with a visit.",2
Will never visit a zoo again,"Unfortunately, I find myself echoing some of the negative opinions shared by others.

The Lisbon Zoo has an impressive variety of animals, but it’s hard not to feel sadness for some of them, given the conditions they are kept in.

The bird enclosures, in particular, were distressing. Some of the birds appeared to be in clear distress, confined to cages that were far too small.

The chimpanzee enclosure was similarly inadequate. On the day I visited, the chimps showed signs of stress, likely due to ongoing maintenance work in the park, and had smeared their feces on the windows.

While the dolphin show was impressive, it was heartbreaking to see such intelligent creatures confined to a small environment when they belong in the open ocean.

My visit to the Lisbon Zoo left a lasting impression, but not a positive one. As I walked out, I couldn’t shake the sadness of knowing that, while I was leaving, the animals would remain locked in cages, often for the rest of their lives. It has made me question whether I would visit another zoo, and I sincerely hope that zoos, in their current form, become a thing of the past.

I truly hope that the Lisbon Zoo takes the feedback from myself and others seriously, and works to improve the conditions for the animals in their care.",1
Animal cruelty in 2025!,"I’m surprised by the positive reviews of this zoo. For capital city in an intelligent European country this Zoo is positively barbaric. They are solely a space for human entertainment and not for the protection, conservation and wellbeing of the animals enclosed there. I was in tears leaving with my young child. The primate enclosure was the final straw, seeing the the highly intelligent orangutan's, gorillas and chimpanzees all pushed outside in the pouring rain with the doors to their enclosed shut so they’re forced to say outside for visitors to see if abysmal. The reptile has such space spaces, esp the Komodo dragon. There were several elephants in such a tiny space it makes you sick to see. These magnificent animals should be kept in much bigger spaces and with adequate.

The dolphin display was not running when we arrived only at 11am and 2pm but after seeing the rest of the zoo we had to leave.

Awful that they are allowed to operate. I urge animal lovers to report this zoo and make them accountable to changing how they treat these beautiful creatures.

We are members at ZSL London Zoo and the difference between both visitor attractions is between night and day. They could learn a lot by visiting other zoos who do conservation much better.",1
Jardim Zoo-Lixo,"Visit done in the afternoon, but paying the (exaggerated) price of 29 euros, of course nobody thought of reducing the value of the entrance for those who enter after 14:00! Logically, it was not possible to visit all the animals in so little time. We just missed the dolphin show for lack of information. As mentioned earlier the cable car did not work and (almost) never works, but is included in the price of the entrance! The worst thing was to see the (huge) amount of JUSTICE throughout the park, it seems that nobody is concerned about the matter! The animal compartments were also pretty dirty. I only hope to have contributed to the feeding of the four-legged animals, and not to the feeding of the two-legged animals who do not struggle to keep the space minimally clean.",2
Horrible. Not to repeat,"Awful, awful, an experience to never repeat. Slim, sick-looking animals, many of them alone. I don't like these kinds of sites and we went just because we had a birthday party. But it's to come out in tears. Sorry.",1
Not recommended,"This zoo is in urgent need of some renewal and especially better enclosures for the animals.
Some animals sit in very deteriorated spaces, often straight on concrete.",2
The dolphin show is without animation! Nothing interesting.,"The dolphin show is no longer what it was. My 4-year-old daughter didn't even care about it.
The St. Ignatius zoo is more interesting.",2
Bad.,"It is with great sadness that I communicate that my visit was terrible.
I came with the family for the first time to visit the Zoo of Lisbon , I took care to call the park earlier to inform me about prices , operating shows, inform me that everything was working.
We enter the park the train is not working and the telescope is not working .
The kids were excited to walk in the same .
It's really regrettable",1
Bad visit,"Bad experience! My family and I are very disappointed, we paid a very high price and we barely saw most of the animals the animals go hungry, have no water, the white rhinoceros and super dry elephants without any water, the bears go really badly, the tigers very lean, did not accept the ticket ricky rock just because we bought the tickets on the net has no connection.
They don't cut the vegetation.",1
Sad and potentially dangerous for young visitors,"Saddest experience ever.
The bird enclosure has this beautiful and smart birds in very small cages WITHOUT anything else besides sticks to stand on. One of them was banging its head against the cage. Nothing to engage them.

The baboon enclosure has inappropriate fencing, a small baboon squeezed in and out without any problem. Luckily it did not approach any of the children. Otherwise, this would have been a very tragic situation. There were no staff members around, and nobody seems to be aware ofthe situation.",1
Sadly won’t be returning anytime soon. Prices are unjustifiable!!!,"A far cry from what it once used to be! Sadly all the exhibits where mostly closed or in severe need of repairs, not many animals left to see.",2
To not repeat for sure,"My children loved the dolphin's show but I was very disappointed with the conditions some animals are living in.. Animals closed in confined spaces (monkeys for example) looking so sad.. I felt very distressed when I left the site.
There were places with dried artificial lakes, no water in it at all.. The bears place and monkey's were the most shocking environments.
Purely there for human amusement. It's very very sad..",2
Déception,"Il est choquant de constater que certaines installations de parcs animaliers continuent de tolérer des conditions de vie précaires pour les animaux qui y sont hébergés. Ces créatures majestueuses et vulnérables méritent le respect et des environnements adaptés à leurs besoins naturels. Malheureusement, les visiteurs de ces parcs peuvent être témoins d'animaux déprimés, en détresse et présentant des signes évidents de malaise.

La qualité de ces parcs animaliers laisse également à désirer. Les enclos étroits et dépourvus de végétation perturbent le bien-être des animaux, leur privant de la stimulation mentale et physique nécessaire à leur épanouissement. Des espèces sauvages captives qui, dans leur habitat naturel, courent librement, sont ici contraintes de vivre dans des espaces restreints, éloignés de tout semblant de vie sauvage.",2
Muito abaixo das expectativas. Preço absurdo!!!,"Uma desilusão, com muita pena minha. O preço é absurdo para o que oferece. Muito poucos animais. A maioria, não se consegue ver. Os que se vêm estão moribundos. O passeio de teleférico é pobre. Só se vê vegetação. Não recomendo! É muito triste...",2
Má manutenção,"Para o preço dos bilhetes, o zoo devia ter uma manutenção muito melhor, havia até lixo dentro de alguns recintos dos animais",2
Terrible,"Small enclosures, animals do not look in good condition, posters outside showed animals they did not have. Lots of enclosures were closed off or empty. And paid 27.50€ each for what was distressing visit. ☹️☹️☹️☹️",1
The years pass,"I had already visited on two or three occasions. However, it is currently surprising in the negative. We cannot ignore the fact that the years take their toll but maintenance is needed",2
Save your money. Don't buy it!!,Was sooooo excited to wear the beautiful earrings that I got. Unfortunately they were FAKE by the time I got home and wore them once. My gold was fading to a bronze brown color. Sad part is I got some for my mom and a friend. Wish I had known better before I got scammed out of all my money.,1

Unfortunately, the jewelry does not meet the high quality standard that would do justice to the delicate craftsmanship. Instead of a (quite usual in this price segment) Gold plating/gold plating is offered as a gold plating of inferior quality.

After just a few wears, the gold plating is already worn off and ugly signs of wear are showing. The joy of the piece of jewelry is gone after just a few weeks! Due to the poor quality of the gold plating with inferior pigmentation, it is a sin compared to the sophisticated filigree of traditional craftsmanship and the effort and care in the work of the producers.

The customer service (not the store manager, but the marketing department responded to the complaint!) showed no understanding. But what can you expect when a traditional company is taken over by a corporation and run with structures like those at Disney World?

So: Hands off - unless you only want jewelry for the display case. Absolutely not recommended!

**ENGLISH VERSION**

Unfortunately, the pieces of jewelry do not meet the high quality standards that would do correspond to the delicate craftsmanship. Instead of gold plating (which is quite common in this price segment), gold bathing of lower quality is offered.

After just a few wears, the gold pigmented coat is already worn off. The joy of the piece of jewelry is gone after a few weeks! Because of the poor quality of the gilding with inferior pigmentation, it is a sin against the sophisticated filigree of the traditional craft and the effort and care in the work of the producers.

The customer service (not the store manager, but the marketing department responded to the complaint!) was unreasonable. But what do you expect when a traditional company is incorporated and managed with structures like those at Disney World? So: Hands off - unless you only want jewelry for the display case. Absolutely not recommended!",1
Tours with too long and uncomfortable journeys,"Tour of the main monuments and sites of interest of the city, the movements are many and slow and the cars are not comfortable. Our guide was a very good and polite guy who transported us around the city, but it is a very superficial tour without great explanations of a historical, architectural, cultural nature. Just brief hints. Keep an eye on the clock as every half hour in excess has a cost of about € 60.00 which is charged at the end of the tour. We found it boring.",2
"Not a techno club, its only house","Not a techno club definetly, more like a house club with ~20 people. Went there on Saturday, ticket was 12€ ;( sad experience. Not for a person who likes to go to underground techno clubs. But if you are a house fan then it alright",2
"Fake alcohol, expensive, rude and ugly people","The Kremlin smells really bad because of water leaks. The bathroom probably hasn't been cleaned in years, and as others mentioned, there is no toilet paper.

They appear to have fake alcohol and several members of the company have felt ill after one of their terrible, expensive drinks. Avoid. It's the worst club in Lisbon I've ever been to.",1
Ridiculous,"Halloween night, terrible staff. Your security guards are aggressive. If you have to work, do it well. embarrassing.",1
I don't recommend it to any friend,"Place with terrible service, rude and aggressive security guards, bad and expensive drinks. Paperless and dirty bathrooms.",1
Kremlin Is done for me,"This place si a joke, One guy at the entrance told me to take out my rings why I denied and when to another place. So long for those ridiculous and low vibe place…",1
Blatant Racism,"Avoid this place. They charged the people of color in our group more than white customers standing right next to us. No explanation, just straight-up racism. Staff were rude and dismissive when we called it out. If you're okay supporting blatant discrimination, this is your spot. Otherwise, stay far away. Shame on this place.",1
DRUGGED CREW - STAY OUT,Terrible racist club. VIP’s where thrown out because someone was sitting in someones neck. Security guy threw a FIST to the guy. Insane to watch this. They should be locked up. CLUB WITH DRUGGED PEOPLE AND CREW,1
Agressive VIP bouncer,"We had a table of +1k casual, but because my friend went in the neck of my other friend bouncer pushed my friend in the face randomly",1
Terrible,My little brother was knocked out for no reason. Last time I organise an event here. Never come here again. Marginal bouncers. Especially that little baldy. Never again.,1
"Racist, violent and abusive security","A very very dangerous place, the bouncers are racist they punched/hit us at the door, one of the guests came in shoes which they reported were not appropriated, when asked if we could come back after changing the shoes , bouncers started abusing us physically, punching a woman on her head and she passed out, they still didn’t stop. Felt something out of a movie.
The unprovoked bouncers pushed and hit women, we were all screaming for them to stop but they abused their powers. Police also attended the scene but not further action was taken
A very corrupt place",1
Security abuse and racism,"This is a horrible place! The security is so aggressive for no reason me and my family got kicked out of the line because one of us was wearing crocs (we are indian) but they let a white woman with sandals go through. VERY RACIST!

They also pushed and punched my family FOR ASKING ‘how come she got let in but he can’t get in with his shoes) (referring to my cousin). Horrible horrible place. NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN.

When police were called security went and hid away. Overall this place is very bad and they treat people very inhumanly.",1
Don’t go to this club if you have a dark skin color❗️❗️❗️,This is the worst club to go if you’re black trust. They try to charge me and my friends 250 each while everyone else pays 20. They said that our outfits were not dress code while there was none I was wearing completely normal clothes just jeans and a white shirt .So if you black trust me don’t even waste your time,1
To flee,"Horrible terrible to avoid. Fights, no security. Fortunately the police came quickly to protect us. Owner who did not even bother to listen. Security service surely in cahoots with the thugs who are authorized. Pay close attention to yourself",1
Not worth it,"This place is so not worth it. Despite being part of a pub crawl, I wasn’t allowed entry along with another black person. After sometime, I was eventually allowed in. The process to check a coat was ridiculous and the workers weren’t friendly. Some of the security guards gave my friends a hard time and charged them €250 when everyone else had to pay €20. When I went to go help them out, the guard wouldn’t let me back in despite being with a group that was allowed entry already. Someone earlier that night had warned about this place and they were right. Just look at the reviews. DO
NOT come to this place.",1
Fight club,"since it opened it always has fights at the door, i saw many until i stoped going. if your an MMA fan you might have some fun! ohh wait no, they normaly pick inocent kids TO BEAT EXTREMLY VIOLENTLY",1
Bad.,Bad place. Non-transparent profiteers with prices. Prices are different depending on who enters and what is advertised at the entrance is absolutely not guaranteed.,1
"Terrible, Racist & Unprofessional","I pre-booked a table for me and 8 friends and pricing and confirmation was confirmed through John (+351 916268 882) and when we got to the door and they saw we had a few black guys with us, they got a bit funny. Bouncer told me there was no booking and that I would have to speak to another promoter that was there, the promoter told me he dont know a John but this contact came through their official instagram page. He then tried to charge us 1,800 Euro for a table or 250 Euro per person for just entry. They are racist and very unprofessional. Your better off going Krystal Club.",1
"Outrageously Unprofessional, Disgusting and Unhuman Behaviour!","Recentl we made the mistake of opting to go to this club. This turned out to be the worst decision we made throughout the entire Erasmus project. The club policy stated that if you sign up and included to the guest list ( a simple application form providing you with the respective QR code for people to scan in the entrance ), the entrance is free before 1 am. All the people went in but since I wasn’t familiar with the policy, I found that out in the entrance. We kindly said we didn’t know that and apologised and proceeded to move to the end of the line to complete the procedure, of course without interfering with the people in the back that wanted to get in. When we went again, having everything ready, the person in front (a muscular bald guy) told us something about having to pay 50 euros EACH (there were 2 of us), promptly changing the price to 250 (!) euros each, unlawfully, indicating a clear abuse of authority. When I asked about what’s the difference between doing the application back home or here, he blabbered some stuff about “respect”. We clearly didn’t disrespect neither him nor the beach club, neither did we cause any problems. After we went back again they said that the best thing they could do is make an offer, 20 euros for me and 10 euros for the girl (another unjustified distinction). Let me note that the time was still before 1 am. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS WE DID!!",1
theft legalized with a lot of hypocrisy,"local nothing short of degrading and embarrassing, 40 € admission for male tourists with an invitation to leave if not agree with the price changes made on the spot. bouncer who exercise abuse of power despite the knowledge of theft. I strongly advise against any kind of experience connected to the local.",1
Don’t go there,"It don’t worth it, we had a table there, we paid 500€ for 3 vodkas, they gave us 3 juice with it.
After we finished the juice, half of the vodka was remaining, they told us that a juice bottle (that worth 1€) cost 20€.
Total shame",1
Rough,"Charged 4€ for a tap water, the cocktail bar doesn’t serve cocktails, hate English- charges an extra 10€ entry for tourists and genuinely rude. Music from 2015",1
Nul,Really lame experience. 20€ the entrance so that finally there will be people around 3/4am. The music was really not crazy without adding the fact that the transitions between the musics were lamentable. The DJ took no recommendation and was quite unpleasant. The glasses of alcohol were little filled while for 12 € the vodka redbull in Lisbon I expected better. The place was beautiful but that’s all.,1
"Flee, violent and racist security","2024 and this kind of situation still exists, this company should be avoided, all the staff are racist and even more violent towards women. They are sick, the bruises on my arms attest to this following arm locks to control me. Knowing that this beautiful group of idiots who support each other, are triple my size in width and height... visibly normal, lunar.",1
Rude security and over charge a lot,Came here to have a good night out first of all the security was really rude to me and my mates and secondly they tried to charge us €250 a head just to be able to get in! Personally wouldn’t recommend be careful!,1
Aggression of waitress and doormen,"One of the worst experiences of my life. A waitress put a wrong drink on us, and instead of changing it, she jumped off the bar and grabbed my friend by the hair for no reason.
To make matters worse, they kicked him out of the club and denied us the right to file a complaint, until the police came... the doormen were very rude by the way.
Not to mention the terrible drinks they serve, in a tiny glass",1
Underaged crowd and watered down drinks,This place is an overpriced underaged bad club. Came to have a good time with some good music and was met with watered down drinks and 16 year olds. Genuinely not a good time.,1
Abused by bouncers,MY FRIENDS GOT BEAT UP BY THE BOUNCERS! When we tried to go back in bc my friend left her card they wouldn’t let her and then proceeded to push her to ground and slap her face and hit her stomach. My other friend stepped in and they got him in a chokehold and beat him up. It was 8 bouncers against 2. We called the police and they made us wait 1.5 hours while hanging up on us every 50 secs and once they got there they didn’t do anything. This club can go to F off. They are fkn abusers and can burn in hell.,1
Scammers,"1 only because it is not possible to give less. Outrageous and extremely rude staff, they try in every way to screw you and they succeed easily by having you surrounded by bouncers as soon as you try to ask for clarifications regarding the money that they deliberately screw you with a crazy system designed to rob you. They stole from me, literally STOLE €20 without giving me any explanations",1
Absolute rip-off,"Paid 20 euros entry, paid for a bottle for 200 euros, went out for a smoke and suddenly had to pay 250 euros entry. Absolute crooks",1
Violent!!,"I have been to this club several times. The first few times I found it very pleasant and fun, but yesterday a friend and I were violently thrown outside through a side door. The reason? We sat on the toilet too long? (Not for long) while we were relieving ourselves there was a loud banging on the door and we said we were almost done, 1 minute later the door was kicked in and 5 men came towards us to forcefully throw us out. This is misogynistic and unacceptable. When I asked what the problem was, no explanation was given. Don't support this!!!",1
Absolutely rude ***holes,"Horrible. Bouncers and staff are incredibly disrespectful, racist, prejudice, egotistical and rude. __",1
Horrible,This place is rubbish. I was mistreated for no reason and my friends and I were denied entry without justification. When trying to understand why I was taken by a security guard who physically treated me in an unacceptable way. Going to this place is giving money to a place that frequently mistreats its customers and has a long history of violence on the part of security guards. I've only been there once before and I'm definitely never going back.,1
THE DOORMAN AND THE CUSTOMER,"The space is only as good as the barbaric kids who urinate outside and don't know how to deal with their drunkenness inside.
As for the doormen, their imbecility in dealing with customers only makes them the only thing they can know in life, which is to be a doorman as a profession. It's so simple, at least they dignify it dammit!",1
"DONT EVEN BOTHER , GO ELSE WHERE","If I could leave zero stars I would !! Gave us a hard time at the door , was over charged for items on final bill and food Got us sick after we left. They treated us very different because of our skin color our skin. Would not recommend find another place to enjoy that will treat you good.",1
Terrible,We did not feel welcomed at the venue. Host treated us differently than all other guests at the resort. Certainly will not recommend this to other,1
Horror show,"Mice all over. Trash on the ground. Watered down drinks, they added money to my tab. Music was brutal and they charge a $250 dollar cover. What a scam. Stay away

Especially if black, they’ll create a “guest list” as soon as you get close.",1
Racists,"If you are black they will turn you down at the door. The obvious racism was unfortunate.
Racism is alive and well in this country.",1
Racist! Do not come here if you are black.,"I had a great time in Lisbon it’s a shame I have to Leave this review. This venue was the only negative experience I had in Lisbon but due to the outrageously racist attitude by this establishment, I have to warn others so they can avoid experiencing the same thing.

Our group consisted of 6 men we are all from the UK. 4 black men and 2 white, 3 of us all black had left another and we agreed we will all meet at K Club. When we approached the doorman we asked if there was an entrance fee and we’re told it was €250 each I was shocked and asked why it so much? The doorman said “this is a guest list only club, if you don’t like the price go elsewhere.”
Sensing the vibe we left and as we walked down the water front the other 3 members of our group were approaching we told them what had happened. Our friend could not believe it so they decided to go and speak to the doorman. Our 2 white friends went to doorman and asked about entry and they were told it would be €50 each.

My friends then asked why we (their black friends) were quoted €250. The doorman became very hostile and told our friends to leave they could not get in any more they asked to speak to the manager. This escalated the situation and the doorman told they to leave in a very impolite manner not wanting to escalate the situation further they returned to the group.

Fortunately we continued to enjoy our night elsewhere and had fun. But this put a downer on the trip. You do not expect this from such a metropolitan Western European city. It’s a reminder that there are things you have to beware of when travelling as a black person sometimes you will be treated differently purely due to the colour of your skin.

Lisbon is a brilliant city and I felt welcomed everywhere but this place is a stain on the city.",1
Worst Ckub ever,"It is with regret that I share my recent experience at your nightclub. Despite an investment of over €1000 for a lounge, the overall experience fell unexpectedly short. The staff we encountered unfortunately exhibited a level of incompetence and arrogance that significantly marred the impression.

The quality of service received did not align with the financial expenditure or expectations. As someone with a background in the industry, this was unquestionably the most negative clubbing experience I've ever had and i traveled the World. It is my hope that efforts will be made moving forward to enhance the standard of service and the professionalism of the staff. Guests' investment in such an experience undeniably warrants a greater sense of appreciation and attentiveness.",1
Scam tourist,"They scam tourist by letting you pay €50 entrance fee, while others only pay 10 or 20. Would not recommend to come here!!!!",1
"Awful staff, good music","At the entrance the bouncer said the couple had to pay 30 each, then we came and told us we had to pay 40. We told him the couple in front of us only had to pay 30. Then he had the balls to say you pay 40 because you're ugly. Anyway, good music, awful people",2
Discrimination for men of color,Employees are really racist … they make all the white guy enter for 30€ or free every and then my boyfriend had to pay 80€ because is a Latino !!! Big discrimination over here in 2023 man !,1
Pouca vergonha,"Uma das piores experiências na noite em Lisboa uma vez que, a entrada é uma pouca vergonha…..aconselho que nunca se dirigem ao local…….sejam felizes noutro espaço",1
Péssima experiência- seguranças racistas e descriminatórios. Dão preços olhando na cara,Péssima experiência. Estava com meus amigos e foi-nos cobrado 250€ por pessoa para entrar. Mas o que nos deixou muito chateados é que as outras pessoas que estavam na fila foi-lhes cobrado 20€ para mulheres e 30€ para homens. Seguranças altamente descriminatórios e dão preços olhando na cara das pessoas. Com esse preço eles não queriam que nós entrássemos. São racistas e descriminatórios,1
Really aggressive personal,"We were told that this is the best disco in town , in deed the music is good and the place is beautiful. But the personal is very agressive and so not polite . We don’t understand why they treat the clients like this . We had to leave because of the girl ( security) in the bathroom cause she has a really bad attitude and was talking so bad .
I don’t recommend this place ever !",1
DISCRIMINATION,"DO NOT GO. Arrogant doorman was searching for reasons to not let us in, ended up saying our outfit was not appropriate. Our friends were inside and they literally just came from the beach wearing beachwear, so this made us believe it had nothing to do with clothing. Discrimination at its finest, only straight white people get in.",1
Sitio peligroso para españoles,Pegaron a mi novio 5 tios cuando no les conocía de nada ni había hablado con ellos. Es un sitio peligroso en el que por ser español te vienen a pegar. Mucho cuidado.,1
Lorte Urban,"Lorte sted, kræver 240 euro for entre hvis man er turist… klubben er tam og vagterne er sure på en som om de er bedre mennesker",1
Transfer that doesn’t wait for you is pointless,"Transfer that does not wait is absolutely pointless…. They are well aware of the extra time that is needed at Lisbon airport, but will use it against you. Don’t book w them, just take metro ffs",1
the insolence of the staff from position No. 1 at Lisbon Airport,"we booked a bus ride from Lisbon airport to the city center. we had a few hours for a change. booking a ride, I had a confirmation in the made reservation request for a child seat. the woman from the position bula slow, then canceled our ride. ruined our afternoon. luckily the booking gave us the money, but never again with this company",1
Better not,"I received reward from Booking - free taxi service by Laneexpress from airport to our rented apartment for Lisbon visit.

After landing we went to the meeting point and there was no sign-off a driver.... There were three display boards and my name on an A4 sized paper was visible, another driver called the number in order to help me not to make any roaming costs, but no one answered not for one but for several calls.

After disatiisfaction and lost time, we used metro... We have never received explanation or apology from this company, and Booking taxi department processed our complaint in vain...

I don't recommend anyone to go through that while on vacation.",1
Save yourself the money and take someone else.,"I genuinely think this is a very fishy service.
I went around in circles trying to find the right person to start with. Then, after going round and round in circles, I finally found Miss Ego.
She was super rude, unhelpful, and told me I was a no show as the flight was delayed and so were our bags.
The other booking agents seem to strongly dislike this bunch and they directly said to me they work with amateur drivers during my initial search for the right rep and the driver.
I wised up and instead of arguing with Miss Ego (who, after starting off super disrespectfully with me after she literally told me my money was gone and when I got upset she tried to “teach me manners”. .. yeh, that’s a no from me), I decided at that point that I am incorrigible and opted for a cab.
May have cost twice as much but saved me 500% of the headache - which is what I was trying to do with my mobility challenged 80-year old father and 75-year old mother. Advice 1) don’t use this firm. Advice 2) don’t book any taxis through booking dot con.",1
Unreliable company,"Company with lying drivers who don't answer the phone. He left my family (including an 8-year-old child) waiting at Lisbon airport until 23:30.
I complained to Mr Jonas and he quite badly polite said that the driver is not required to answer the cell phone.
Everyone knows the chaos that lives in Lisbon Airport because of the inability to serve passengers well and this was not taken into account by the driver Rui.",1
Don’t Book,"Booked taxi in advance from Lisbon airport to city hotel , taxi didn’t turn up. I rang the number given several times when I reached the designated meet point , no answer !!! Don’t book them !",1
Waiting for the driver/taxi for more than half an hour.,I have been waiting for more than half an hour at the airport arrivals and there is no sign of the driver. They don't even answer the phone. I asked a colleague and was told it is arriving in 20 minutes. Absurd. What do I book to do if I have to wait so long,1
Cancelled our driver 30-mins before pick-up time.,"Cancelled our driver 30-mins before pick-up time.

On arrival, e were promised a 16-seater bus and they turned up with two vehicles and said they no longer had it available - although they were happy to charge us for the full price still. On the way back to the airport they called 30 mins before we were due to be picked up and said they had a problem so they could no longer collect us, leaving 14 ladies with their cases on the side of the road, luckily Lisbon is a popular destination so we could get Ubers. Absolutely do not recommend this company.",1
Very disappointed,I booked this company to pick us up at the airport but they didn't turn up. The other taxi firms at the airport said that as the drivers had not been paid then no taxi would arrive. We had to pay again to get into Lisbon. Very disappointed.,1
Pésimo servicio,"Horrible. No se presenta el conductor, no cogen el teléfono, la línea de emergencia no consigue contactar con ellos.

Finalmente toca correr para coger un taxi que por cierto cuesta una sexta parte del coste del servicio.

No sólo no lo recomiendo sino que vista la situación de “búscate la vida” no pienso contratar un servicio de este tipo en la vida, me vuelvo al taxi de siempre.",1
Inefficace et dangereux,"Transfert aller-retour Aéroport -hôtel centre Lisbonne.
Dans les 2 cas, chauffeur en retard. Aucune excuse en réponse à mes remarques sur les retards. Au retour, nous avons failli raté notre vol et seule la conduite dangereuse de la conductrice (3 feux rouges grillés et dépassements par la droite) nous a fait arriver just in time. Après le retard de l’aller, j’avais appelé lanebus pour préciser qu’il était impératif que le chauffeur soit à l’heure pour le retour !
Précision : sur le voucher il est indiqué que le client n’attend pas. Seul, le chauffeur attend.",1
DO NOT BOOK- Cowboy company,The worst experience arriving to Lisbon. We had 4 adults and 4 children booked on a pre-booked taxi and arranged by BA. Upon arrival (after they had taken us away from the airport office) at the taxi they then say we had to pay €10 euros IN CASH for the children to have boosters (even though this is not the law in Portugal- we checked). Once we argued that everything was paid for they said that actually it was for the driver. The children were completely distressed by their refusal to resolve the situation. We then called their “manager” and we asked to pay by card or get a refund they refused. They also refused to give us receipt of the purchase in advance. We finally called BA’s emergency number and they mentioned this is categorically not policy and to not get in the car. They tried to threaten and say Uber would refuse to take us but this was not the case as we got Ubers with the children safely.,1
"Bad hike, poor organization","Unfortunately the castel DE pena and Regaleira were closed, it can happen but we were only notified in the morning on the bus. We were offered to go down but by now we had organized the day like this and we left. As an alternative they took us to visit the National Palace of Sintra and another one whose name I don't even remember... bad experience honestly. Lunch practically compulsory in a restaurant with which they have agreements... we could choose not to have lunch there and go around the center, too bad that the restaurant was isolated in nothing. The guides are useless, they accompany you, they say 3 words counted for each place where they take you and stop. Bad experience, wasted money. In addition, GetYourGuide (where I booked the excursion) censored my review stating that it did not comply with their policy (which is probably to deceive people). I must have been unlucky, I don't recommend buying on GetYourGuide.",2
Very very disappointed,"We were a family of 4 with about 40 people on the bus -our guide was Mr Mario-I do not think he should be called a guide also-inspite of repeatedly asking him to explain the history of the places we were seeing,he did not say a word and at the Garden of Regalaira he did not even come inside saying that his card had expired 10 days back-unfortunately we were left on our own without any explanation of what we should see inside and it so happened that we actually did not see the tunnels it is famous for-his only job was to tell us what time we should come back-so so disappointed-would not recommend this tour with Mr Mario as the guide to anyone-it was a waste of our money-we had taken the tour on the 10 th of June 2025-even the company should have made sure that his card had not expired",1
Rude & Indifferent Cattle Car,"Firstly, shame on TripAdvisor for false advertising. This was advertised as no more than 25 people, but we were on a 41 person bus that was completely full. We also booked an English tour, but instead was Portuguese, French and English - so as a result any commentary was limited.

Not that commentary would have been great since the guide (Antonio) was a rude jaded veteran who cared more about getting free drinks and food for himself at each stop than the enjoyment of his guests. He is a go through the motions guy that should move on to something else.

His colleagues seem to fit the same mold, so recommend skipping Lanetours if an option for the itinerary you wish to do. We have great experiences with the other 5 tour companies we booked on this Portugal trip (and found Portugal fantastic!)

The stops themselves were nice and can recommend this loop, just pick a different company.",2
Overall disappointed.,"There are a lot of reasons where this tour fell short, and I feel a bit sad that I hadn’t chosen a different company to execute the tour but this was a last minute option. It was overpriced for the experience and professionalism received. The guide had communicated to be back at the meeting point in 45 minutes, and had left before that time, forcing me to get an Uber to the next meeting spot. I didn’t even get to see it because by the time I arrived we had to go to the next point.

It’s too many spots for one day, and so it feels super rushed the whole time. You really will feel like as soon as you get out of the bus, you have to rush to get back on so you don’t get left. The communication wasn’t great, it was difficult to often find the guide as he had no stand out clothing or umbrella to help find him. I was quite disappointed in the whole experience.",2
Bruno Almeida tour to Sintra and Cascais a dangerous riot. Not for seniors.,"Bruno was the worst kind of guide. He paid no attention to the safety of his group. Nor did he track that everyone was staying together. He wanted to plow through without imparting any facts about what we were seeing. He was committed only to delivering info to be read later on Whattsapp. The tour was a total waste of time and money.
What was the worse thing about Bruno Almeida? When asked to be respectful of the pace of the seniors that were lagging behind in 104 degree temperatures he outright refused.h He blamed them for being old and not capable of keeping up so they were not entitled to see anything!!!! I can’t believe this guide has ever been credentialed.
Then he turned a private conversation and began to yell at the group, Am I a bad guide? Multiple times trying to raise a melee!!! Please stop these entitled seniors. It was damgerous and created terror! The riot atmosphere was pure insanity! The negative manner and anger to a simple request was totally unprofessional.",1
Boring and not worth the price,"It wasn’t a detailed trip, felt like i just paid for being driven around in an air conditioned bus. Information about locations were not detailed and twas so brief.",1
Scam,"Had a tour and they never picked us up! We also had another group doing a different tour & they didn’t show up either! After an hour on the phone, they kept giving us the run around with NO answer & left all of stranded at the pickup location!",1
Not reliable,"Golpe! Absurd! I arrived at 8:15h, and by the combined time 8:30h they said that they were late, had not arrived, infirmed the wrong registration, and until 9:00h they kept telling me another registration, and did not appear at the meeting point Alameda Cardinal Cerejeira. The person who communicates with you says he is not on the bus, so you don’t know if the information is true. In the end, they said that I did not show up at the meeting point. And they didn't give me my money back or they didn't pick me up for another trip.",1
Terrible and disappointing experience,"This tour was a big and unexpected disappointment. I booked it after looking at reviews. But here’s how it went.
We left for Fátima at about 8.40am. We were taken straight to a shop on reaching Fatima, this is not on the itinerary!! The merchandise was very expensive and we spent 45 minutes here which was an absolute waste of time and unnecessary. The tour company probably gets a commission for dragging people here. This delayed everything!! Everything in this shop was very expensive, rosaries holy water etc was triple the price. I bought nothing from here and just wanted to get out of there and so did the other people on our tour. But nobody said anything to the tour guide Lili. So I went to him and told him we would like to leave.

We then went to the shepherds house which was really good and that was one of the reasons I booked this tour. Our tour guide Lili was very knowledgeable and did a good job of explaining everything about the 3 shepherds village. We also got to see their houses.
After that we left for the sanctuary and reached there at 12.30pm and were told that we would get 30 minutes to visit the sanctuary and had to leave Fátima at 1pm.
This really bothered me as I felt we wasted so much time in the shop and had we not gone there we would have been able to spend at least 2 hours in the sanctuary.
The itinerary said we would spend 2 hours in Fátima and there was an opportunity to hear mass. I can understand not having an opportunity to hear mass but 30 minutes was too less to visit the entire sanctuary. When I told the guide Lili that it was unfair that we just get 30 minutes at the sanctuary he told me that I should have booked a private tour if I wanted more time. That was unfair as the itinerary says 2 hours in Fátima. So I was not being unreasonable.
As a result of this I did not go back with the tour. I stayed back in the sanctuary and took another bus later in the day back to Lisbon and was able to make most of my time at the sanctuary.
I hope the tour managers which is Lanetours takes this feedback on board. I regret doing this tour and I would definitely not recommend it.",1
Not what we signed up for!,"We did this trip in order to see Fatima and our tour operator gave us hardly any information about Fatima. At each location he basically just dropped us off and did not tell us about the location we were seeing.
This tour felt like a glorified transportation trip with no air conditioning on our bus.",1
"Just a ride in a hot, cramped bus b","It was basically a bus ride, in a cramped and stifling hot bus. Don’t go if you’re over six foot tall, the seats are cramped together and the AC did not work.

Looking to learn about the sites you are visiting? Google them because they don’t tell you anything about the places you are “dropped off” at.",2
Scam,"We were not told we would go to a very secluded restaurant at the end of the trip. It was neither mentioned on the voucher nor by the guide. So people had to pay for a menu on which there was no price (27€ actually). I ordered nothing but the girls seated at my table were not comfortable about this situation, they didn’t dare to say no. At the end of the trip, going back to Lisbon, on the bus, the guide gave everyone a QR code to have some good ratings but as I confronted him with his lack of honesty, he did not give me the QR Code so here I am, writing this review on my own.

That is a shame ; people should have the choice and not be compelled.

I personally think that the restaurant and the guide are in cahoots

Also we stayed about 30min in Cascais.",2
Disappointing,"The visit itself well, although too long not used and the visit to Cascais dispensable for how fast it was. The worst part is that for lunch there was already a restaurant in which the menu was priceless. It was €28 that didn't deserve it. I feel ripped off.",2
Run away is not worth the price!,"Alfonso is a good guide but yesterday the program was not respected.
We didn’t stop at cascais as it was marked in your program and in addition we spent the morning by car only so no visits to the streets, shops then stop at the mouthful of hell very beautiful but the small shops were closed seen it was the morning...
Then visit in the late morning of Regaleira at the pace of the race and no visits to the gardens downstairs or the building we had no time it seems.....
Barely time to take some pictures , no time to enjoy the place a minimum climb in a tower etc...
Then meal 1h therefore impossible to visit the center of sinta barely time to eat then departure for Pena at 1:45 pm.
The classic low tour except that the ticket to visit the interior of Alfonso Palace did not work so visit without guide but he tried to explain us after things had seen as best he could.
We had 12 minutes to visit the small chapel and the viewpoint then 30 minutes to do the inside of the Palace.
16h back to Lisbon arrival at 16h45 at the return point.
We are disappointed with a service paid 160€ for two. for two.",2
Shady company,"I went to the location they told me to go to, in addition I went to the location in this listing, and no tour guide showed up. I messaged them on WhatsApp and Trip Advisor that morning and they never responded. Now they’re saying I was at the wrong location and they tried calling me which is completely false. I should have known with only two reviews that something was shady.",1
"Locations amazing, but not a good fit for those wanting more detail","The locations were amazing and our tour guide was very friendly and a pleasure to be with, however, we were disappointed in the amount of time spent in each location (too short - less than advertised) and the lack of information offered out each location. This isn’t really a guided tour, it’s more of a transportation option if you’d like to hit each of these spots on one day. If you are looking for quality time and detailed information about these locations, this is not the tour for you. If you are looking for more of a means to getting to these spots, this is the right fit. In hindsight, I think a small group tour would have been a better fit for us, but I don’t think we were entirely clear what we signed up for.",2
To flee,"We were offered a change of activity from half a day to a full day, we should have refused. We spent most of the day in villages with no real interests to spend only half an hour in Sintra (the same time as in Estoril. Two hours for the meal, the same time we had for Sintra (waiting time included to access the park and palace). The tour is conducted in a military way, leaving us with barely time to go take pictures or go to the bathroom. We are even picked up at the exit of the palace because we are ""late"" (30 minutes to visit, you will not even have time to read a single sign). In short, run away and book an activity that focuses only on Sintra and Pena Palace. This one is not worth it and you will not be able to fully enjoy the gem that is Pena Palace.",2
Beware the airport transfers arranged by Lanetour are a Scam:,"We had a transfer booked and paid for arriving on an international flight early morning on the 16 June. The booking states if it takes you more than an hour to reach the driver the booking is void and you lose the payment.
Our flight was due to land at 7.10. This means we would have until 8.10. Our flight landed early. Touch down at 6.43. But, as logically happens with early arrival, the Ground Crew were only ready 15 minutes later. So, we disembarked at the scheduled time. Therefore arriving on Lisbon soil at the scheduled time. We are not ones for dallying and moved fast through the airport. On receiving a message from Ricardo, our driver, we messaged back at 7.22 to say we were at passport control. His response with many loaded “…” astounded us: “ Ok.. let me explain: your flight landed at 6:43 ... After landing, 1 hour is counted.. after that 1 hour the service can no longer be carried out...”.
It was clear from this message that there was dubious intention to honour the agreement and timeframe printed on our voucher. We were already suspicious and not thrilled with the dismissive attitude. Nonetheless, we rushed through and reached the meeting point at 7.55 - which was 15minutes before our intended flight arrival and time registered on our voucher. We received no response to our 7.57 message saying we were there and then found a disheveled and acerbic women who claimed to be the owner of the Lane Transfer company. She told us Ricardo had left on another transfer. This was at 7.57…. SCAM ALERT… therefore despite our printed timeframe giving us until 8.10 to arrive Lane Transfers had taken our money and managed to get more business from someone else in the time paid for by us. It’s a great scam when you can get double payment for a single service provided. We attempted to reason with the woman, but she was obnoxious, shrill, unprofessional and basically told us she did not need to be honourable as she had plenty of business and did not need ours. We have travelled a lot and have not been robbed like this before. The reason for this review is to help travelers to not use this company. There are plenty of competitors who work with honour and care about their customers - Lane Transfers is definitely not one of those and you should give it a wide berth!",1
"This was Transportation, not Guided Tours","I am surprised that the reviews are so high. This felt like transportation, not a tour. Our guide shared little to no information at every site. The large van wasn't very comfortable - little leg room and the AC wasn't cool enough. If you just need transportation to key locations, it's good.",2
Poor experience: communication and politeness could be improved,"This tour was supposed to stop in Batalha but did not. When we arrived in Nazare, I asked the guide why there was no stop in Batalha, he was almost insulted that I asked the question, as if I should have known. Other passengers didn’t know either. There were 4 stops listed for that tour and we skipped one: do we get a refund as this is not what I consider honouring a contract? Communication failure? Before arriving in Nazare, the guide told us twice on the microphone with poor sound that we had to be back at 14:45h. Bedford heading off, a passenger dared ask the guide the time we had to return: the guide responded “ let me repeat a third time..” on a rather unpleasant tone…well at 14:45h we were back but the guide and half the group didn’t show up. We waited until 15:05h and departed with the driver only. Suffice to say that we were mocked. The plan had changed a second time and no one telling us. Perhaps I’m too generous with my rating.",2
Horribly Crowded,"Horrible place all crowded no space to be or sit, looks like a sardines can, this tourism is destroying Lisbon and their uniqueness",1
Recreational Substances,"If you need drugs, go to Cantinho Bar Benformoso, in the evenings/night you can spot the black guy in sunglasses at the steps, who sells drugs and people take them in the stair way. Police don’t really bother anyone.",1
Tourist walks at night blocked for drug users,Got stuck when walking up the alley ways to Graca by the local drug gangs who were protecting their customers shooting up in the stair ways. Not a place for women or families.,1
"Litter, graffiti, drugs",This area is going downhill fast. Which is a shame becuse it’s so diverse it could be amazing. Many of the cafes have been closed down. The drug dealers are creeping in and drug taking happens in open sight. There was a recent nurse. Place to be avoided. Not a place for families.,1
Urban nightmare,"Horrible experience, full of drug addicts, some of them violent. We passed by there on a Sunday morning, somebody from my family was slapped on the street and we ended up complaining to the police (who seemed not to care for the violence). Avoid going there. Avoid renting a place there.",1
really rude,"Really rude company, I had a event cancelled last minute also and really found it uncomfortable speaking with Rita, looking at the below it seems the company don't respond well to negative feedback and try to deter others from doing so which is quite unprofessional. The trip was nice but I would rather work with a nicer company and nicer people.",1
Great activities poor management,"Great activities however shame that the people that work there are rude and poor in communication. Be prepared to wait days for responses, have your activities cancelled and changed last minute. Really difficult company to work with. Those that go I'm sure will have a great time as the reviews below suggest but for anyone actually looking to organise it spare yourself the hassle and stress and go with someone else.

They list a number they don't actually want you to call or message them on, but only respond to emails on existing booking once you use the WhatsApp to prompt them. The company customer service is a joke.",1
Very disappointing,"I picked this scavenger hunt because it was the only one I could find that you could do with just one smart phone (I was with my 11 year old children who don't have phones). We went on 'Santos-o-Velho‘s Downtown Dash'. Once I had worked out how to redeem my code (which is tricky) we were presented with a succession of 8 locations. Each was shown on a google type map along with our current position so you just follow the map rather than solve clues. Once at a location you simply have to take a photo and then answer a question (answers easily found online) in order to progress to the next location. And that was it. I had been hoping to have puzzles to solve by looking at our surroundings, but it was clear that the creators of this 'hunt' had no local knowledge - nothing quirky, no added value. One of the locations was a museum that was actually closed for refurbishment and at 2 of the locations duplicate questions popped up. Very disappointing.",2
Not worth the money,The music added nothing to the trip. There was no information given about the sights or history of Lisbon. There was no sunset as it was still daylight when we finished the trip. The free drink failed to materialise so make sure you're not shy and ask for it. Can't really recommend this trip.,2
Not a good value.,"We signed up for a Hop on Hop off because it seems to go to four different places. As it turns out it only goes to three places, and two of the places are pretty much right next to each other (about a 5-minute walk from each other). So it's basically a boat from belem Tower to cais sodre (which would amount to an $8 Bolt ride for two people. The boat is small and fairly open so if the weather is not good, you are exposed. The boat leaves every 1-2 hours from each destination so you definitely don't want to miss your boat. They also have a disclaimer indicating that times are variable based on the weather so you never really know if you're getting on the boat until you see it. One of the destinations was supposed to be across the river (caichilas) and it was listed on the email we received after we bought our ticket ($25 each). (Going straight from cais sodre to caichilas by public ferry costs about 3.5 euros and it leaves every 15 minutes). When I pointed this out to the lisboat guy at the dock, he asked to see the email I received and took a picture of it as if I'm the first person in Portugal to ever read the email that listed one of the destinations as caichilas! On the plus side, the crew was reasonably friendly and they went out of their way to pass slowly so you could take pictures of the caichilas area and also of belem Tower. There is a marine type head on the boat. They give you 48 hours to use your ticket but we never went back on the boat after the first trip,",2
Better not,"In itself a nice route and in good weather you can also take great photos, but the disadvantages outweigh:
1. There is no indoor area, so in January, despite 14 degrees and sunshine, everything freezes. Actually, you should not offer this tour in winter.
2. There are no comments or other explanations during the journey! This has nothing to do with hop on hop off and against the background it is also quite overpriced.
3. The route from Belém to Lisbon was so slow that you could only get seasick in the waves...
4. It is more important for staff to attract all possible passengers on board than to stick to the timetable. The fact that the passengers who have already boarded, meanwhile, are sitting on the uncomfortable chairs as ordered and not picked up is secondary...",2
Beware of LISBOAT!,"Do not use Lisboat for the tour to Belem. Unreliable company boat left with 1 hour late on schedule and non-existent return ride, canceled without notice, they forced us to spend more money on taxis and lose 16 euros return ride. Misleading behaviour for users",1
Lack of information,"The problem is the lack of information.
We took a usable 48-hour ticket. The first day the return took place in a different place from where we had docked so taxi home. And on the second day the schedules were different. No boats at 3:00 like we were told when we bought the tickets, so taxi again. No information on the schedules at the Tower of Belém .
A real pain....",1
Very frightening boat trip in Lisbon,"Took a river boat trip from Lisbon to Bélem. Weather was good - nice sunny day but water was a bit choppy but nothing to worry about. However when boat neared Bélem ALL changed - difficult to get alongside the floating pontoon as waters were so choppy & when we did get moored disembarking the boat was incredibly frightening. EVERYTHING was moving, the boat, the small portable gangplank, the pontoon & the attached rollered gangplank up into the café. I am fit but I completely felt I’d lost the use of my legs when leaving the boat & became so very lightheaded. Just so much instability had made me feel like this. After 3 hours in Bélem my husband & I thought that the return trip would be calmer but alas it wasn’t!! We got on to the boat, then one of the mooring ropes suddenly became loose & there was just ONE crew member to sort as the other crew member had gone to WC/Café!! It was a terrifying situation to be in - one solitary crew member having to suddenly do TWO tasks. He jumped into the wheelhouse & started up engine to reposition boat against pontoon - then to run to back of boat to quickly tie-up to the mooring. He worked well but we as passengers were petrified & we will never travel again with Lisboat in Lisbon. Please improve your health & safety & please employ more crew for your boats. We all want to feel safe and sound whilst relaxing in Lisbon.",2
Terrible,"I did not go on the boat. When I went to the Lisboat Window, there was nobody there. I didn’t know where to go to get the boat, since there were several boats at the Terminal. After I went around and asked about ten different People working there — I figured out that the boat had already departed.

There were NO signs to direct Ticket holders who were unfamiliar with the Terminal.",1
Terrible experience,"We did not receive proper direction from the person in charge, which led us to the wrong boat. When we went back to explain the issue, she was rude and unprofessional, even laughing in our faces. Regardless of how we missed the boat, her behavior was inappropriate, as she found amusement in our situation and made fun of us.",1
Not a good experience. No information poor communication. Not what was expected.,"We've been living in Lisbon for just 2 months and had friends visit for a few days. We thought about taking a hop on hop off bus tour to get a guided trip of our city. I then saw we could do it by boat with Lisboat. Not so. I asked the woman when I bought the tickets about the tour and she said there was a QR code on the boat. I asked on the boat and was told it was in the bathroom. It wasn't. No guide, just a boring (and beautiful) ride down the river to Belem. We took a Tuk Tuk back to get more of a guided trip. Totally not worth the 58 euros per couple.",2
Difficult bottom pacifier,"A scab with the minimum possible service, no information and as far from affordable as you can get. Hard-hitting rock bottom among all the other tourist traps.",1
"Boring with absolutely no commentary, very average.",The boat trip was boring. No commentary whatsoever so there was no understanding of what various landmarks were. We walked back for 90 mins to avoid the return boat trip.,2
Not really an experience,"A trip on the water … always an experience!

We came to the station Belem Tower andnobody was at the ticket desk … the guy arrived 2 minutes bevor the boat left !
Very slippery way down …. Staff not really interested in guests. No guided tour at all - any public transportation is cheaper and might be friendlier !",2
Self-taught bike tours,The guide was very very nice but unfortunately he was the substitute and didn't know anything about the type of tour we had to do and we paid for a tour but we could have gone on our own by bike. We collected and read the information self-taught.,1
Decepcionado,"Nuestro guía de habla hispana fue una persona muy buena y agradable. Pero una guía horrible. Era profesora de historia... Así que primeros 40!!! minutos que pasamos en nuestro punto de partida escuchando TODA la historia portuguesa hasta nuestros días. Cuando comenzamos a caminar, y estamos como bien, finalmente... ¡Pero luego caminamos durante 4 minutos y nos paramos de nuevo durante 20! escuchando la historia del terremoto que se puede contar en 5 minutos perfectamente. Nadie quería ser maleducado, así que nos dejamos llevar. Mas tarde, la guía simplemente iba a su aire, sin mantener control de grupo... si deteníamos para tomar fotos o nos perdíamos entre la multitud, ella no tenía idea porque no estaba mirando. Al final del recorrido, fuimos a Alfama, uno de los barrios más famosos de Lisboa. ¿Y sabes qué estábamos haciendo en lugar de explorar el vecindario? Estábamos viendo videos de youtube de cantantes de fado famosos... Y eso considerando que el fado no es nada nuevo para nosotros, y hemos estado en varios conciertos de fado en Oporto. Nuestro grupo era solo de 4 personas, tal vez ella podría verificar si estamos interesados en ver
videos de youtube en lugar de hacer el tour... De todos modos, lo intentó, supongo, a su manera. Pero estábamos increíblemente aburridos ya que no compramos una conferencia de historia o un curso de introducción al fado, sino un walking tour.",2
Got no-showed,"Convenient meet-up location, only our guide did not show. We were scheduled to meet at 10 so we got there around 9:50. By 10:20, I had tried calling the company multiple times and no answer. 10:30, we gave up and sat down at a cafe, then got a call from a very snappy man saying we missed the tour and it was at 9:30… I have confirmation emails, vouchers, etc that all say 10a. Very frustrating and didn’t get offered a refund or apology of any sort",1
Horrible prices,"The environment was excellent and the employees exceptional, but the prices are absurdly expensive and do not justify the service.",1
Disorganized,"Disorganized staff. Food and drinks overpriced. Especially old jokes, but some good talents in the line-up. No glasses of water are served. Fries and sauces came separately, with 5 minutes difference. We left to smoke and when we returned there were people sitting at our desk. Our drinks, for drinking, had been placed by them on an empty table. They said it was an employee (I don't know if it was) who assured that we had left.",2
LOTS OF DISORGANIZATION,"We had a reservation for 8:00 pm for a table of 10 people, by then almost everyone was already at the table, it was a pleasant atmosphere, lots of good energy, good music and out of nowhere a BIG DISORGANIZATION, music blaring that you couldn't even hear the friends who were front and side for me, a HUGE DISORGANIZATION in the catering, orders placed and it took more than 2 hours and 30 minutes to arrive at the table, okay I completely understand a full house but the fact that there were only 2 employees serving a full room? Shameful for the restaurant, above all, very bad for those who are serving. I placed my order at 8:30 pm for a starter and it only arrived at 9:54 pm……. Another fact to point out is when ordering through an app I found it funny and modern but it ended up being a big mess and disorganization as some were eating while others were still waiting......not to mention that one of my friends waited almost 3 hours for a hamburger, he even mentioned to an employee that he would wait another 10 minutes, otherwise he would cancel his order, after a while the employee said it would take more than that, “10 minutes” so he ended up canceling it until the hamburger arrived at the table. and he ended up accepting, as he was eating he was the last one to eat as everyone at the table had already eaten, we discovered that the hamburger was completely raw …… it was sent back, everyone who ate the hamburger complained that the bread was COLD meat or breading was BURNED around it and one of them even came raw, I hate making these types of comments because I've worked in the area but I honestly found it shameful that a place that could have a lot of potential and is going down the drain, all around me I saw and heard customers complaining either because it was burnt or the food was cold or because they didn't order it... To make ordering easier, it would be easier for the employee to place the order, it would be easier for everyone, customers and employees, so everyone same time and everyone was satisfied, it was the first and perhaps the last time I come to this establishment, I'm sad because I really liked the comedians and the space, but the food was a huge disappointment, we spent almost 300 euros and were dissatisfied, I won't recommend it... …",1
Far below expectations,"The quality of the food does not match the price at all. We paid 15 eur for a dish with 4 pieces of spare ribs that had more bone than meat... The food came cold! The spectacle of (and some of) the comedians was limited to misogynistic comments, and they spent more time making fun of the hair, names and professions of people in the audience than telling jokes with real content. A disappointment...",1
Só que não....,"Chegamos a porta, tinha fila pensamos okay está tudo a espera de entrar. Chegamos a nossa vez, o moço que estava a porta a registar os bilhetes ( que nem sabíamos que iam ser precisos) não falava nem português nem inglês, era russo. Lá conseguimos falar com um rapaz que estava na fila que tinha comprado bilhete pro espetáculo que ia ser completamente em russo. Saímos do Seixal pra vir experimentar, visto que não há supostamente cartaz pro comedy club viemos a surpresa.... Pra não voltar a repetir.",1
Não vamos voltar.,"Não recomendo.
Menu caro para o tipo de espetáculo que nos proporcionam. Deixa muito a desejar pela falta de qualidade e de profissionalismo de algumas comediantes que subiram a palco. De lamentar.",1
Didn’t understand the racist(?) joke,"The performance overall was nice, but the singer made a joke where she said “we are improvising like a rap battle except we have GOOD style. We are GOOD people, we are good like Eminem, not bad like Jay-z.” Now, maybe something was lost in translation and I would love to hear an explanation of what she was trying to say with that joke and maybe I’ll delete this review, but all I heard was “we’re good white people, not bad Black people.” Maybe she felt safe making that joke because there were no Black people in the audience, but I did not appreciate it and it really distracted from the experience for me.",1
Terrible... Unacceptable,"A horrible, squalid and decadent place that certainly does not seem like a place where you listen to fado.
At the entrance to the venue the employee is a violent man who put his hands on me, I am a lady in my late forties , throwing me out of the door with such violence, throwing me into the street and locking me and my friend out of the door before the show started, just because she kindly asked to explain the fact that the tickets sold did not have assigned seats, but first come, first served... (when purchasing the ticket it is not mentioned anywhere... Only a mini paragraph in English at the bottom of the page after the purchase visible by scrolling to the end) terrifying experience. The police had to intervene... Horrible, really not recommended.",1
Aggression by Indian employee my 50 year old Italian friend,"It was awful. I invited a non-Portuguese friend of mine of 50 years to experience a night of Fado as we do every time I visit, I am a Portuguese of 44. The employee who received us from non-Portuguese origin indicated us completely separate places in the room. Attention because this information is not given to us before buying the ticket that the seats are not marked. I pointed out that my ticket was two-place and that we wanted to stay together as the show was beginning he suggested that we talked out there (my friend here was not even hearing what I was talking to him even) I followed him to get out and my friend without realizing where I was going came after but I suggested that you stay in there and go watching the show the moment when the employee without absolutely no reason comes behind me and violently grabs my friend by the arm under the axil and literally shoots her out of the establishment. My friend yelled for him to let go and I too and immediately tried to hold her so she didn't fall to the road the moment he came back in and closed the doors and locked us outside. Without ever saying anything. We called the police and tried to get the complaints book that was only very expensive was delivered to us more than an hour after the incident and even one of the musicians tried to persuade us not to write the complaint. Horrible place and in nothing reflection of the Lisbon Fado experience. Even ASAE should also check the conditions of the space.",1
Racism at Fado (Show),"My husband and I were looking forward to our Fado night at Lisboa em Fado. Unfortunately, Sara Paixão, the female artist that performed that night ruined our evening.

At first things went as planned. We arrived, sat down and fully enjoyed the show including the sing-along.

At the end of the performance, several people went to the front of the venue to speak with Sara and with a male artist who also sang that night. My husband was feeling a bit claustrophobic, so he decided to skip the meet and greet session and stepped outside. As I patiently waited in line for my turn to speak with Sara, I noticed that she was very friendly and engaged in conversation with all the people who approached her. When it was my turn, she totally ignored me and attempted to speak with the people who were behind me. Although her behavior caught me off guard, it immediately dawned on me that she was being dismissive because I am a Black person. I do want to point out that I do not play the race card every time something goes wrong. There are instances like this one however when it is obvious why one is being discriminated against. I had also realized early on that I was the only Black person in the audience which is trivial to me. Despite her behavior, I still congratulated her and let her know that I had had a great time. She did not deserve my kind words after what she had done but I am proud of myself because I demonstrated that I am the bigger person. She swiftly thanked me and proceeded to start a conversation with the folks behind me.

I am an open-minded, highly educated, well-dressed and well-behaved person who expects to be treated with utmost respect and dignity. Shame on you Sara Paixão for having such an unacceptable behavior! I have already shared my experience through social media and beyond. I also have a video that proves that I was in attendance that night.

There is no place for racism in society, especially in this day and age. Moreover, businesses should value all of their customers because they depend on them. Lisboa em Fado depends on us the tourists, who are the people who attend these types of shows.",1
Didn’t feel welcomed and the organisation of the show was not there,"Need to organise more of what they will sing, felt very disorganised and wanted the audience to sing more than the artists. Need to show more care for the customers and looked after without no rude comments if people want to have another glass of wine",1
worst experience of fado,"worst fado in lisbon,waste of money and time,highly disappointed.
For Live concert I was not expecting 20 minutes of prerecorded screening of fado.",1
Very disappointing experience - 4-hour tour LISBOA,"Pensei bastante sobre esse review. When we did tours in the past, we always have a follow-up of the person asking if he liked the tour. No one has contacted us. Their instagram is very active and I contacted and booked the tour with them in January to February 6.

The lack of proper communication significantly damaged the experience, as we missed the opportunity to learn about the rich history of Lisbon. I found this misleading and lack of professionalism for a tourism company, I explain why:

I booked a tuk-tuk tour with Lisbon Espera Porti Tours for 300 euros. I made it very clear in the conversation, that I would like to have the tour in English. I was expecting a professional and engaging experience in English, as Carla promised me it would be. Given that this is a tourist service, I did not question your claim — speaking at least basic English is the minimum expected of a company that serves international tourists. Unfortunately, the reality was very different from what was promised.
When her husband Carlos called us, it became clear that he spoke very little English. He could not explain anything about the history or sights of Lisbon in English, it was all literally in Portuguese despite promising me that he spoke English. And I had to constantly remind him to speak English — otherwise he would only speak Portuguese. This forced me to translate everything to my partner, which was frustrating and completely overturned the purpose of a guided tour.
To make it worse, I realized that other tuk-tuk tours around us stopped at the sights and explained their meanings in fluent English. In contrast, our experience was disorganized and nothing engaging. Carlos was leaving us at a point, saying “And for it, I will be here when you return.” My boyfriend who has an interest in learning about other cultures, could not even ask questions because Carlos's level of English was extremely limited.
For 300 euros, that was extremely unfair and disappointing. A tour for this price should offer an informative, pleasant and trouble-free experience. Instead, we feel deceived and frustrated. I do not recommend this company to anyone.

And the worst of all this?? Their website says they speak English! But neither the minimum nor the basic was discussed with us.. What absurd and deceptive propaganda

1/5 - Avoid at all costs",1
Horrible cancellation!,"The organizer messaged me in the morning asking if we could move the class from 3:00 to 4:30. This was inconvenient and I thought it was odd, but I moved my schedule around to make it work. When I was about to call my uber to go at 4:00, he cancelled altogether. This was valuable time in my trip to Portugal lost on such short notice. Stay far away from this “experience!”",1
My bad review of Tripadvisor,"My bad opinion of Tripadvisor. I bought a gift for a friend of mine - a cooking workshop 26.01 17:30. 1 day before the workshop, I got a text with my certificate.

At the specified time, my friend arrived at Lisboa Food Studio. It was closed. Calling the address indicated, it turned out that there was no workshop on the day. I have no complaints about Lisboa Food Studio, I have no doubt it's a great place.

But Tripadvisor has not fulfilled its obligations. I paid the money for the workshop, my friend spent time on the road and, despite the rain, arrived on time and had to find out why there was no workshop. I am very unhappy and do not recommend Tripadvisor for booking experiences

I tried to book this master class earlier, last time I got cancelled because the group didn't pack. My money was returned and I was warned in advance. That's fine. But this time, I'm very disappointed with Tripadvisor.",1
Two mixing bowls between 8 people = limited involvement and poor experience and not good value for money.,"The facility was really nice
Miguel seemed really nice and his delivery was good.
Unfortunately the ‘learn from scratch’ class was not as expected.
Two mixing bowls between 8 people is not really a €45 per person hands on learning experience. The format is just wrong especially post Covid. Lots of awkward waiting around to participate, everyone’s hands on the dough. We ended up in a team of five due to other participants being a bit clueless. We had a child who wanted to do it all and to be fair to his parents they barely participated because of this. Just became irritating and embarrassing so we left. Expected Miguel might at least contact us to see what was wrong. He didn’t. We requested a refund and were denied and to make matters worse Miguel never sent us the post class recipe and instructions.
If you want to learn how to do it all and participate this is not the course for you try Compadre Cooking School. A big disappointment in an other wise great trip",1
"Nice experience as such, but not skillful storytelling","The idea is good, but the museum needs to be able to communicate in an efficient way. Audioguides only worked semi-well, the story was childlike and at the same time it wasn’t so right for smaller children. The vision for the museum’s narrative seems random; especially unfortunate when there is so much history to tell without it being flat and bad.
We did not hear anything that we did not know in advance. It has so much potential to become so much better!",2

Most boring experience…walked out after 20 mins,"This is a great example of trying to dumb down a subject to make it accesible and devaluing your precious subject.

As someone who is intrigued by history and travel I had looked forward to visiting the Lisboa Story. I was so disappointed. It felt like someone had tried to dumb down the subject and ensure people have to make no effort to read anything or use their brains. This revolves around the use of unhygienic audio guides. There is no choice but to use the audio guides as the whole thing is based on listening to boring, amateurish audio that is thin on content, whilst looking at terrible visual loops on tv screens.

The best museums understand that one size does not fit all and provide different exhibit areas that will appeal to different people. This is definitely not one of those.

We walked out after 20 minutes of tedious boredom. Such a waste of money.",1
Doesn’t worth the time and money,"I am Portuguese and I know the basics of Lisbon city history. After visiting Lisbon Story Centre my knowledge about Lisbon history remained unchanged. Obviously this is not a good sign.

The description says this is an interactive experience but there is no interaction here. We are given a audiobook that starts playing automatically when we pass through the rooms, there are some screens on those rooms, and that’s all. There is not even a single button to push to interact with anything!

In the first rooms, the audio is not synched with the video on the screen, so you are listening to one thing and watching another thing, which is very confusing!

In the last rooms, the audio and the video are synched, but when you enter the rooms you start listening and watching in the middle of the content, so you need to wait the content to finish and then finally watch it from the beginning.

Normally when I visit museums or exhibitions about history, the first thing I get is a chronology bar, with the main events and periods marked. This one has none.

For me was a waste of time and money visiting this exhibition the way it is. Hope it can improve a lot and be a really story telling of Lisbon. I do not recommend it as it is today.",2
Waste of time,"The worst museum I have ever been to. Unorganized, without any signs or help. Terrible experience. It is a waste of time.",1
Worst exhibition we have ever seen,Uncritical portrayal of history. Glorifying presentation. Embarrassing and bad. We would never have believed it possible.,1
A short walk through the story of Lisbon (from the Portuguese perspective only),"The museum tells the story of Lisbon in a short and straightforward way, basically taking you through the main events from its foundation to what it has become today.

I found it a great option for tourists who may not have much time in the city and are interested in learning a bit more about Lisbon (which was my case).

It was a good experience overall. The museum has a decent structure, there's audio guide available, some interactive parts, staff is friendly, tickets aren't expensive, etc.

What really pissed me off was the complete lack of mention of the peoples who were cowardly and brutally colonized and slaved by the Portuguese from the XV century.

They do have a specific section where they talk about the great navigations and the discovery of the new world, however, they only emphasize how courageous and bold their explorers were and how their conquest made the crown wealthier, not even bothering to briefly mention at what cost it all came - millions of lives, to say the least.

Being from one of these countries I found it extremely disrespectful, specially as these events still have a huge negative impact on our society to this day. It should be their responsibility to show people (specially new generations) that colonization was all but heroic.",2

He told us they were on strike (a lie). We also told him to drop us off there, he dropped us off far from the station and to top it off, he charged us 35 euros when it's a 10 euro ride and it's in cash.

The number on the back of the cab was 3041 and the driver was a short man with grey hair and a short greyish beard. He turned off the meter and we were unable

When we arrived at our hotel, he quickly jumped out and retrieved our case from the boot - then charged us 50euros for the fare. I thought it was expensive but having just arrived we weren't too sure so we paid him and gave him a tip. Inside the hotel we asked reception how much the fare should have been - they said no more than 15 euros! We had been ripped off! Please make sure that the driver puts the meter on before you start off, or else they will try to rip you off - seems to be a standard thing in Lisbon with newly arrived tourists like us so be aware!!",1

He had a meter , and a credit card service and was all smiles with friendly advice in broken English; where are you from; first time in Lisbon; all the usual. And then when you felt comfortable, tried to check the price but there was a language barrier and we paid double the normal fare. Silly us for trusting. Ask the fare, ensure there is a meter, and prepare to argue. The Visit Lisboa service at the airport sold vouchers for a fixed price but they were not available as no one would commit to a voucher service and you know why. They do it well in Spain; time for the same in Portugal.",1

I didn't notice the transaction on my account until the following day and I'd been charged Eur 240.

Tip. If you can't pay cash or get an Uber and you have to pay by card, double check the amount and note the taxi number.

When we were about halfway to our destination, I got suspicious as the price already over 30€ and climbing fast. The final trip price was 51.5€. Maybe he had his screw-the-tourist rate applied. On return by Uber to the same place we started, cost was just under 10€. Great driver to boot. I would like to think this experience was rare, but from other reviews it is unfortunately not.",1

It was late and we were tired so we assumed it was because we were 3 people and had luggage - in the morning we checked with the hotel and realized it should have cost us 20 Euros at most.

Incredible naughtiness!!!!,"Incredibly cheeky!
We used (or wanted to use) a taxi 3 times...
The first one claimed we didn't have to go to the address we gave, although we were sure. We hadn't asked him for his opinion either. Then he let us out halfway & said we were wrong anyway (?!) the rest we ran (and we were of course right with the address!) I don't know what his problem was?
The second one was very annoyed, but has taken us to the desired place without further ado.
The third one was DRINKING!
He got totally angry and called us crazy several times (made a gesture with his index finger against his forehead, so a la do you have a bird?) because we only wanted to drive a short distance (on foot 25min). We didn't want to go on foot due to medical problems & it was totally cancelled!
Then he told us to run or get an Uber...

Sorry, but the taxi drivers don't have to be surprised when no one drives a taxi anymore and everyone only uses Uber.

Absolute cheekiness!

Do not trick by taxi driver at Portugal,"Really take your time to ask for price before you get into the taxi or just arrange Uber instead.
There actually has a meter on the top left hand corner of their front mirror, but passengers will not see it unless driver press somewhere on the mirror
What I experienced was being charged Euro 45 from cruise port to my hotel that is actually 1km away .As a reference, I taxi from Sintra which is 26 km to the same hotel was just Euro 36 after.
The trick the driver used on me and my husband was to use the busy and confusing environment to play tricks on us.
There was long line up at the port, there actually lots of taxi .The driver rushed to us and pretend to be sooo busy and grapped our two hand carry luggages and dump into the trunk when it is our turn to get the taxi , because of the rush ,busy environment and vibe we didn't realize that was no visible meter and forgot to ask the price before we got into the taxi , when my husband realized it and asked the price, the driver said Euro 45.
He also mentioned he has to pay Euro 10 to the cruise line, I do not know how true it is!!
There is actually a meter on the taxi that I realized when I taxi from Sintra!!
So, in order not to get rip off by driver there, please take your time to ask for price, prepare for small change , or just arrange Uber which is more reliable
The way they rip us off is totally unacceptable!!!.",1
Avoid Taxis at Lisbon Airport! Damage in the right.,"We arrived in Lisbon, coming from Spain where we were treated very well and served by taxi drivers, in several cities. The run to the hotel, only 8 km away, cost 35 Euros !!!! At the hotel, reception staff was also scared and instructed us to use only Uber.
What taxis don 't know is that their dishonesty dirty the image of Lisbon and Portugal .",1
Be Aware,"We arrived at Lisbon Airportand asked information center about the best way to get to Oriente station as our flight was 3 hrs delayed and had train tickets to Porto. The information ceneter advised us that it is only 2 train stations from the Airport and will be faster and more economic as the Taxi would be around 15 Euros. Once at the Metro station the metro stopped. So went back up to take a Taxi and as i was in a hurry did not ask how much? Got in the Taxi and it was about a 10 min ride to Oriente Station.
So i asked how much do i owe and was ready to give him 20.00. He said it is 38 Euros. sShowed me the meter and he had maniuplated. I told him the information center told me Max of 15.00. He said they do not know what they are taking about, I paid as i did not want to miss my train. Once up in the train 2 ladies had taken a Taxi from the Airport for 12.00 Euros.
So be wary and deal before you get in a Taxi in lisbon.
I forgot to take the Taxi number, He is a Tall about 6ft tall with long hair and his name is FAVIO. He also was bragging about travelling and said he managed 5 Taxis.

One other day in down town Lisbon another Taxi driver said his Meter is over headted and does not work. So guess what i got out of the cab.

It is sad that they give a bad experiance to travellers.",1

After 2 minutes that we were in the street we found him in front of us and and he SHOUTED that he wanted my phone otherwise ""he punched me"", in the end HE KICKED ME with all his strength in the shin (luckily without consequences, only severe pain and shock) and ran away insulting us. Of course I'll report it and call the embassy, and I'll do anything until the friend loses his license and the desire to do certain things.

It ruined my first day of vacation. That's why Portuguese taxi drivers have bad reputation outside of Portugal never take a taxi in Portugal again.

We decided to ride. The man was falling asleep so we caught his eye and from that moment on he was somewhat friendlier. Our surprise , when we arrived at the hotel and looked at the taximeter he scored 9.85 Euros and when asked how much was to pay him, he immediately deleted the screen and with his face well washed he told us it is 30 Euros. My husband and I were shocked, I actually took the license plate number because we felt stolen. We will not use this service again in life. I don't recommend him to my worst enemy.",1

Bolt and Uber in Lisbon; not completely only partially useless,"We were in Lisbon for a week and a half and tried using ridesharing for most of the first week. Both companies batted about .600 (for those not into MLB lingo, they worked 60% of the time). The rest of the time, drivers seemed mystified as to where we were, despite our location being activated on our phones. The reality is, they knew where we were, but apparently both apps had difficulty pinpointing our location and relied on us, with our limited knowledge of the city to verify whatever location they came up with. Rather than drive a block or two to where we were, drivers just drove off after 5 minutes, a practice uber encourages by forcing payment. The upside of all this was it forced us to rely on Lisbon's metro system which turned out to be efficient, safe and cheap.",2
Robbery,"We were robbed by a taxi driver in Lisbon who charged 60 euros for the 3km journey from the airport to the hotel, an absurd, so be careful taking a taxi at the airport",1
Ripped off,Don't trust these taxis. We went from Lisbon Airport to Travessa da Queimade 46. A fare we later found out should only be around 25-30 euros. When we arrived I got out to get our bags and my wife paid him - 45 euro's !! then he said the transaction did not go through and by this time he charged us 50 euro's. Soon after I check our account and both transactions had gone through. A total charge of 95 euro's - no wonder he wanted to leave as soon as he did after dropping us off. Use Uber - not these coloured taxi's !!,1

Beware of thieves,"I found a dishonest person helped by those who coordinate people to direct them to taxis outside the airport. He took advantage of it because I was alone and to travel two and a half km, since the hotel was nearby, he made me pay €34. Absurd, definitely a thief.
I recommend that if you are alone, never take a taxi for 6 people, as they already charge more.",1
Unfortunate,"We arrived at the airport at 6 am and looked for a taxi to take us to the hotel.
The driver was a strange guy because, in the cold of the morning, he was wearing extremely short shorts (not even Bermuda shorts!).
I had bad taste, wore perfume that burned my nostrils and drove very dangerously.
But that was the least of it. Worse was the unfortunate guy stealing from us, charging 4 times more than expected.

I would avoid Bolt Portugal,Have had a number of bad experiences with Bolt drivers cancelling at the last minute having accepted the trip and leaving me in a difficult situation. Just today pre-reserved a trip to the airport. Driver cancelled at last minute when he was already late. The app tried repeatedly to get other drivers who all refused. I cancelled the trip and sought alternative transport. Bolt then charged me for a cancellation. Outrageous. Have been trying to submit an official complaint but being given the roundabout by Bolt support staff. This is actually illegal as they have to allow formal complaints according to Portuguese law.y experience suggest Bolt is not reliable in Portugal.,1
Lisboa (Lisbon) Taxicab Drivers Steal From Tourists,"Lisboa (Lisbon) taxi drivers are obviously criminals intent on stealing hundreds from tourists. Diogo Cravo stole $138.69 by providing a receipt for 12.85 Euro, but secretly swiping my credit card for $138.69. Even though I provided the receipt to Chase Card Services and timestamp proof of the fraud, they initially refused to reimburse me, but the decision is currently being reviewed by another un-contactable department.

Avoid Lisbon taxis and use Uber or Bolt. If forced to use a taxi, pay in cash unless you want your credit card to be charged hundreds of dollars. Because of this experience, I will always go for ridesharing services where possible.

On May 19, 2024, I submitted written details and uploaded receipt and other documentation/details to the following entities:
1. Polícia Judiciária by email.
2. Department of Central Investigation by web form.
3. City of Lisboa by web form.
4. U.S. Consulate in Lisbon by phone.

I expect Diogo Cravo and the many other Lisboa Taxi criminals to be arrested, especially since I shared information about countless other tourists being ripped off. If they are not arrested, I’ll have to assume that city officials are part of the scam to steal from tourists. I hope that is not the case as Lisbon was my favorite city on my recent travels.",1
Lisbon taxi,Avoid Lisbon taxis they over charge. Stick to Uber. I visited recently and the taxi (not Uber) spoiled our trip and it was our first impression,1
Avoid Lisbon's regular taxis,"Most Lisbon taxi drivers, especially the younger ones, work in order to overcharge tourists. They will obscure their meters or not use them at all, take longer routes, and so on - often while claiming not to speak English even when they do. Use Uber or Bolt, for transparency and reliability. They're also much cheaper.",1
Habitual Scam Artists,"Ensured the meter was on, ensured we took a direct route, we were in an 'official' Lisbon Taxi - all the advice given to tourists arriving in Lisbon, but upon arriving at our hotel the driver switched off the meter, got out to remove our cases then said the fare was €28. I said the meter said about €14. He insisted that was the distance then pointed to a supposed price list in the rear window. It was raining, we'd been delayed five hours, he caught me at a low ebb and I knew I was being ripped off, but didn't know what to do. I insisted on getting a receipt, which he agreed to. I foolishly gave him the money, he returned to the car to get my change, then drive away! Shameless thief - and another family member had the same experience earlier that day traveling from the airport. These guys prey on unwitting tourists. With hindsight I should have brought him back to his taxi meter and told him to show me the fare - apparently it's illegal not to use the meter - Or I should've asked a member of the hotel reception staff to come to advise on the situation. But I paid, like a fool. These guys are career criminals who do this day after day. Don't be afraid to refuse payment until you're sure it's a valid price. Otherwise this horrible start to your visit will linger in your mind - and finding a way to report the cab number to a taxi regulator seems impossible....I'm still trying",1
Watch out for scams,"We thwarted an attempt by the driver to scam us. We were picked up at the airport in Lisbon and taken to Britania Hotel. Our meter said our cost was just under 14 euro. The driver asked for 43.50 euro! He said it was a ""weekend fee"". My husband told him we travelled here a month ago and there was no such thing. Then he asked for cash and would not take credit. When we pushed further, he said to give him what we thought the ride was worth - it's worth what's on the meter! He left with 25 euro cash. We will always use BOLT or UBER in Lisbon as unfortunate as this is. One driver taking advantage of tourists is one driver too many.",1
Taxi driver scams!,"I arrived at Lisbon airport and wanted to take a taxi at the taxi stand. You expect it to be neatly regulated. I couldn't find a taxi that accepted a credit or debit card, cash only! That's actually the first Red Flag! Then the ride from the airport to the center of Lisbon cost me 67 euros! I had asked others in advance what it would cost approximately and they said around 15 euros. The amount he told us was really disproportionate. He reacted very aggressively. When I told him to call the police, he agreed, but I was very shocked and paid to get it over with. However, I now want to warn other people!
A second time I thought I was smarter and asked to turn on the meter. The driver arrived with an app on his phone; according to him, it is the latest of the latest and that everyone works that way nowadays. I was scammed again with the amount I had to pay. For me, for this reason and many others (including the enormous queues for the tourist attractions), no more Lisbon!!",1
Rip off Lisbon,Where do you start 🤷🏻‍♀️ ripped off from airport - ripped off from town to hotel - be careful! They say don’t use über but in my experience they are much more honest in the pricing - so fed up - been ripped off in restaurants- taxis - shops - wont be back to Lisbon anytime soon,1

Subsequent conversation with hotel staff confirmed the 35 euro cost was 2.5 to 3 times what it should have been.

Airport Taxi over charging tourists,"I arrived with family on 30/12 at Lisbon airport. We took a taxi from the taxi rank to the hotel that is 5 mins away. What a mistake that was. The journey should have been less than €9 (I used the fare calculator on the taxi website later to verify it). But he flashed a charge card and pointed yes to a fare that was€24.50 and said that’s how much it was. We didn’t quite believe it but paid it at the time and asked for a receipt and took a picture of his license plate. Later on when we contacted the taxi company on the receipt about the over charge, the company responded and said the number plate on the receipt was not the number plate in the picture so they can’t do anything about it. I have reported it to the Lisbon authorities but not sure if anyone is going to reply yet. I also couldn’t see any meters in the taxi so I should have insisted they advise the cost beforehand.",1

The driver used ways to locate the place, after he typed the address he drove but he didn’t use his set belt so i was worried then after around 8 mins. He said that he forgot to put on the metro so he turned it on, then he continued to drive until we reached the destination. When i checked the metro it was 7.20 euro then he said that i should add 10 euro because he forgot to turn it on before leaving the airport. Not my fault! Is it fair for 10km distance? By the way he didn’t put on his set belt the whole journey. The plate number is on the photo.",1

(tracksuit trousers, a tank top to show off his gym muscles. Cap with visor that not even his eyes) very bad experience (it also created a lot of anguish) I will remember it forever and I will think twice before taking a taxi in Lisbon. Unfortunately the negative reviews I had read are true...",1
Avoid taxis if at all possible. Uber instead.,"Taxi drivers don’t seem to know their way around their own city unless of course the circuitous routes they take are a very unsubtle way of ramping up their charges. Out of 12 rides over a 10 day period, 3 by taxi and 9 by Uber, the three by taxi involved unsolicited tours of the streets of the city in 2 cases ending up at the wrong destination. All the Uber rides went without a hitch directly to the required destination often with knowledgeable and friendly drivers.",1
"Be careful with large taxis that look like luxury, they are","Public taxis in Lisbon, in general, are cheap and have very friendly professionals. The exception that proves the rule and with which you have to be careful. Large taxis are allowed to charge more so if you are in line at the airport to take a taxi, be careful!!!
A trip (Airport - Portugalia in Pascoal de Melo) that normally costs €10 at most, they charged us €30, a theft. The police who are organizing the queue at the airport do not notify you, but you should know that you can tell them that you do not want a large or luxury taxi and that you prefer to wait for another one. By the way, the taxi driver was very unfriendly and tried to hide the taximeter at all times.",2
Take any other means of transport if possible,"From Norwegian Viva to my hotel in Baixa (Equina Urban Lodge) the driver charged 35 Euro which is more than 3 times what it should be.

That's just crazy no matter what country I am in? “Lisbon Portugal”they can charge whatever they like.
Dishonesty and overcharge tourists.

We got in the car and the meter was charging an astonishing 10 cents per second! Unbelievable!
I asked him to stop at the first bus stop so we could get off and we still paid 22.50 euros for a 2-minute ride! He kept saying that the fare had a very large adjustment the previous week... very dangerous
So I called Bolt from that place and my ride to the hotel was 6 euros… if I stayed in the taxi it would be around 200 euros for sure",1
AVOID RAXIS IN LISBON AT ALL COSTS,"AVOID TAXIS IN LISBON
I hate generalisations, but sadly, begging mugged by taxi drivers (specially those taking you from / to the airport) seems to be the norm rather than the exception in Lisbon.
We took a taxi upon arrival at the airport to get to our hotel. The driver showed some artistry in overcharging us, no doubt the result of a repeated, perfected pattern. The taxi meter showed 12€ something, then he charged the extras (this is understandable, since luggage and airport transfer fees are not registered by the meter) and this added up to 24,90€. I insisted on paying on the spot, but he wouldn’t listen and went out of the car to take the suitcase out of the boot.
Once he entered the car again, as if repeating his previous words, he said 34,90€. I replied he had said 24,90€, and when trying to refer to what the taxi meter showed, discovered he had performed his magic again to show, now, 34,90€. When I confronted him he said he “had to” charge me for his waiting time at the airport. By then I had it very clear that I was being overcharged, so I asked for a receipt. Can you read the license number in it? Neither can I, good proof he wanted to leave no trace. Oh and he wouldn’t take cards, so I had to pay in cash.
As a result we didn’t take any other taxi in Lisbon and moved around with apps like Uber and Bolt which provided excellent service at very reasonable prices. Incidentally, a Bolt car to the airport on the day of our departure cost only 10,67€.
So please spare yourself a bad experience in Lisbon and look for alternatives to taxis, I wish I had read the reviews in this forum myself before our trip.",1

Avoid taxis in Lisbon,"If you ever visit Lisbon you should try to avoid taxis specially if your coming from the airport. As an alternative you should use UBER.

When we asked, we were told it would cost €32 because it was a van. Exact prices weren't posted. Especially since the taxi driver suddenly couldn't speak any English or Spanish. At the Mercure Hotel, I went to reception without paying. The friendly employee came out with me straight away. And there was a bit of back and forth. I offered him €25 or the police, because he was a rip-off! He accepted. The hotel employee said that a guest had called the police a few days previously.

The taxi is cheap in Lisbon, but be careful with those who cover the taximeter, manipulate the flag drop and refuse to give you a receipt.

Questi soggetti che gettano ombre sulla categoria, si dovrebbero ricordare che nell'era della tecnologia le cattive notizie si diffondono alla velocità della luce! Un controllo non guasterebbe.",1
Plus jamais,"Arnaque, un conseil ne prenez jamais un taxi à Lisbonne. De l’aéroport au métro alemeda 24,5 euros. Je pensais que c’était les prix fixes aéroport-centre-ville comme dans beaucoup de pays. Un monsieur d’un certain âge comme chauffeur, comme quoi l’habit ne fait pas le moine! Le reste du séjour j’ai pris Uber et j’ai toujours été satisfaite. A mon départ j’ai fait alemeda-aeroport j’ai payé 5,55 euros pourboire inclus.
Voilà, un homme averti en vaut 2!",1
Frightening experience,"Drove erraticly.Mafe phone calls while driving.Couldnt find ,4 pts Shearton hotel.Rang two people for directions.Stopped in middle of road.Asked me to sit in front to use my Google map.A frightening exoerience",2
Mai più taxi a Lisbona solo uber,"Transfer da aereoporto di Lisbona a cascais con uber 28 euro autista disponibile,transfer inverso 60 euro con taxi. Da notare il tassametro spento e l'autista che guarda il cell mentre guida. Solo pagamento contanti e nessuna ricevuta. Purtroppo non parlando portoghese e avendo già aperto il gate non ho potuto contestare ma se ritorno a Lisbona mai più chiamerò un taxi",1
No a good experience,Not pleased with this taxi service or driver. Hotel estimated a €8 trip from Martim Moniz Square to the cruise port but the driver charged €15. The driver spoke ZERO English and did not know where to go once he got to the terminal. If you take a cab to the cruise terminal have someone who is bilingual and speaks Portuguese negotiate the price and explain where you are going.,2
Terrible experience,We used Lisboa Taxi to get from the airport to the old town and the driver told us he can’t drop us off at the address provided. He stopped 1km away and we had to walk with luggages down and up the hill after 17 hours of flight 😕. On our way to the rented place we saw quite a few taxis on the narrow roads. That was so unprofessional and a terrible experience for us!,1
De taxirit op de heenweg bijna 3x zo duur als op de terugweg.,"Van 16 tm 20 Februari heb ik een stedentrip naar Lissabon gemaakt, toen ik geland was pakte ik een zwart/groene taxi bij de aankomst ik had een taxirit van 6,5 kilometer van de aankomst naar het 3K hotel en ik moest €24,- betalen, toen ik vanmorgen een taxi terug pakte van het 3K hotel naar terminal 2 moest ik maar €8,40 betalen. Dus op de heenweg moest ik ruim €15,5 meer betalen, dat vind ik toch flinke oplichting!
Bij aankomst had ik geen flouw idee wat een gemiddelde taxi kost en tuurlijk kan het zijn dat ze avond tarief vragen, maar 's avonds om 21.00 uur is het ook een stuk minder druk als op een maandagmiddag rond 13.00 uur.",1
Da evitare,"Meglio 100 volte Uberto o botte, e comunque i servizi pubblici sono eccellenti sempre preferibili.

Buon servizio ma...,"Eravamo un gruppo di 14 persone per cui ci siamo divisi in 4 taxi...autista giovane e simpatico,ci ha chiesto se era la prima volta che venivamo a Lisbona e ci ha fatto un miniracconto delle vie principali...all'arrivo in hotel (6 km circa)la sorpresa:26,40 euro(con 3.60 euro per i bagagli...ormai fatta abbiamo pagato senza obiettare ma,sentiti poi gli altri che hanno usufruito dei taxi,c'è chi ha pagato 23,ma anche chi 11...consiglio:informarsi prima di quanto potrebbe costare la corsa,non dire che è la prima volta che si è in città e controllare bene il tassametro (a volte nascosto o girato non verso i clienti).",2
"Me estafó, me insultó y hasta me empujó cuando vio que le estaba sacando una foto a su matrícula","Tuve un retraso en un vuelo y me vi obligado a pasar la noche en Lisboa. La compañía aérea nos alojó en un hotel cercano al aeropuerto que no se hallaba a más de 5 minutos en coche (nos indicó que el precio del trayecto debía hallarse entre los 5 y 7 euros). Comprobé más tarde por UBER que el trayecto costaba 4.5 euros. El precio era lo de menos porque me lo pagaría la compañía aérea presentando factura. La factura que me entregó el taxista no incluía ni sus datos ni nada, solamente que me había cobrado 12.3 euros, hecho que me hace dudar mucho de la legalidad de esa factura, cuando además puso fecha el día 7 de enero cuando los hechos sucedieron el 8 de enero de madrugada. Mi duda es si el taxista no estaba permitido que trabajara ese día y aún así lo estaba haciendo. Porque no entiendo su negativa a poner la fecha verdadera y rellenar correctamente la factura como hizo el taxista que me llevó al aeropuerto al día siguiente.

Cuando le dije que cumplimentara los datos correspondientes al taxi, empezó a ponerse violento y grosero. Cuando vio que saqué el móvil para fotografiar la matrícula empezó a insultarme e incluso me dio un empujón.

Pensé denunciarlo, pero me quedaban 4 horas para descansar antes de volver al aeropuerto y, por eso, decidí continuar mi viaje (de eso es de lo que se aprovechan).

Dado que no sé si cual es la Ley de Protección de Datos en Portugal (si es que existe), adjunto la foto que le saqué al taxi después de que el taxista saliera del mismo a empujarme, omitiendo el último dígito de la matrícula (74·RH·3*) . El taxista era una persona de 1 metro 70-75 centímentros, corpulento y entrado en carnes, pelo blanco y entre 40 y 50 años. Aunque para eso de la edad soy muy malo y además la noche era cerrada. Si os encontráis algún taxista con esa descripción en un Dacia y la matrícula que os indico, tened mucho cuidado.

Mi consejo es que todo el que vaya a Lisboa utilice UBER para evitar estas situaciones. El mayor enemigo del taxi son los propios taxistas

Servicio de taxi,"Mi experiencia cuando subí al taxi es que no tenia taxímetro, la cual me sorprendió, me cobro 25€ desde el aeropuerto hasta el hotel, me dijo que le diera 30€ y dijimos que no, y le dimos 1,50 de propina encima, y cuál es mi sorpresa que el día que me voy, el hotel me pide un taxi para ir al aeropuerto y me cobro 13,50€, estando encima 20 minutos en un atasco.",2
Not so tradional!,"The boat was not comfortable. After 40 min seated, my back was already hurting.
They announce it as a tradicional Tagus boat, but after some research, I come to the conclusion that there is nothing traditional on that! It's just an old wood fishing boat painted with different colours! Next time I will take a different option for sure!",2
Could be better,"NOTHING NICE. Our time was always controlled, there were almost no good photos. It was always let's go, let's go, we have to go, as if we weren't going to pay anything extra if time passed. Could be better? Yes you could. But unfortunately the person on the day must have been in a bad mood.",2

Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware !! They had clearly OVERSOLD this cruise. They put 6 people in seated positions at the back of the sailboat, and then asked our group of six to huddle on the mat on the front of the sailboat….no seats, no backrests, NOTHING to hold onto.

At one point, the winds were strong enough that the sailboat listed far enough as to have us start to slide towards the edge of going overboard. We screamed. It was frightening. We asked to change places with the six in the back, but to no avail. They finally agreed to make room for three of us to move to the back.

It was pure negligence on their part. And it was only by the grace of God that this did not end with a tragedy.",1
Awful service,"Extremely dissatisfied with the lack of communication regarding this. We made the trip to the area well in advance as no one rang to tell us that due to adverse weather it was unlikely to go ahead. We had to telephone them they did not tell us and were told 10 mins before that it was cancelled. We had to wait in the area for 2 hours to get an Uber back to our hotel and had we known we could have spent the afternoon doing other things. A refund does not make up for that lost time
It was a special anniversary trip and it ruined the day",1

Poor Taxi Tour FRA Lisbon Airport to Hotel,"We booked EN taxi in advance for 73€ with pickup at Lisbon airport and drive to the hotel. That taxi driver treated us very badly, he smashed the car door like we were a criminal. He answered very rude. It was the first time we traveled to Lisbon and it was also the last time. We will never go there again. Bad taxi ride that ruined it all.",1
Terrible experience!!!!,To start to get to T2 you have to use the shuttle and there is nowhere DA this thing so I walked to T2 and there is no sidewalk along the road so people are forced to use the shuttle. Once we get there we understand nothing about how to get to the controls because of the little order inside. Finally once you get to the gates if you want to charge your phone there is only one column where you can insert your charger but half of the sockets do not work and we all find ourselves crowded there to try to charge your phone. I will be used too well with Fiumicino airport...,1
Horrible! No organization!,"Very bad organisation and bad experience at Lisbon airport.
Very few seats seated. People are forced to sit on the floor to wait. This is not normal!!!",1
Lisbon Terminal 2 – and Lisbon in General – Deeply Disappointing,"Absolutely awful experience at Lisbon Airport Terminal 2. The terminal was overcrowded, chaotic, and completely disorganized. There were barely any seats available, and the food options were shockingly overpriced for the quality offered. Staff were unhelpful and, frankly, rude.

Sadly, this attitude wasn’t limited to the airport. During my entire stay in Lisbon, I encountered consistent rudeness from people across the city – from taxi drivers to shop staff, restaurants, and even locals on the street. I’ve never experienced such widespread hostility in one place. It’s incredibly disheartening in a country known for its beautiful scenery and rich history.

It often felt like every corner was another opportunity to be overcharged or treated poorly – a sense of being taken advantage of rather than welcomed. It left me with the impression that tourists are seen more as targets than guests.

Lisbon is undeniably a beautiful place, but the experience as a visitor was so unpleasant that I would never return. I truly hope others think twice before spending their money here, as hospitality and basic courtesy seem to be sorely lacking.",1
I will never visit Lisbon again because of this airport,"I will never visit lisbon again because of this airport. When I landed there was a scammer outside trying to drive us to lisbon, he looked very strange. When I asked my taxi driver he said that if we went with him we would have been robbed. But the worst was when going home. There's way too many people for the size of this airport. There is very little to eat or buy. Nothing is where it should be as in other aiports. The signs are bad. It's very hot and sweaty and noisy. There's absolutely nothing good about this airport at all.",1
Terrible experience!,Lisbon airport is the worst i have ever experienced and that has been a lot around the world. So unorganised with very long queues to get through passport control leading to so many people missing their flights. Staff uninterested in helping you make your flight so give yourself 3 hours. Very sad as country and people are amazing just the airport let's then down. Fortunately we didn't have small children unlike some of the poor families stuck in queues the length of the terminal.,1
Are we humans?,"WORST airport experience, when leaving Lisbon (21/6-2025) to go back home with connecting flights!

Though there was TV-screens that show where you need to go for bagage-check in, it only showed the time and not which desk to go to. Me and my mother went to one desk which turned out to be the wrong one. We had to go to another desk which was about 2-3 minutes away, BUT my mother then felt a lot of pain in her knee and couldn't walk anymore and needed assistance. I then had to get help to find a wheelchair and a person (staff) to help me push my mother and our 2 big suitcases to the other desk. I was left searching after a wheelchair somewhere in the airport, because the staff said that they haven't got a specific place where you can get a wheelchair. I found one eventually, but then it was a big problem finding a person to help me push my mother in the wheelchair so that I could push our bags to the other desk. The staff (""My way"" and others on the airport) were incredible unhelpful and either didn't want to understand the problem or didn't feel like it was a problem. Here I also have to say that if you leave your suitcases unattended you risk paying a fine of 600€. Since NO ONE seemed to care to help me and my mother, I had to push my mother's wheelchair while she held on to our suitcases at the same time and push everything to the other desk. No human decency to be found. When we went to the other desk we saw a huge que with probably 100 passengers waiting in line. While waiting in the que, from nowhere a girl (staff member that I had spoken to earlier) approached us and said that we could pass the que due to that we had special needs (wheelchair). When we got to the desk the woman there asked us to step aside and wait. She then asked us if we had booked assistance (they say to book it 48h before travelling). We said that we hadn't because my mother's knee stopped working AT THE AIRPORT.
Though the woman had a quite bad attitude (as well as the majority of the other staff members I had talked to) she finally helped us. She called the assistant team and they said that they could help us in about 45 min-1h. We emphasized that we needed to get help before our flight was leaving. We checked-in the suitcases with her help and then went to the assistance team area in the airport, to wait for assistance. After about 30 minutes we finally got assistance to the gate (and plane).

I give 1 star for a security guard at the customs service for showing that he really wanted to help me but couldn't leave his position, the girl that said that we could skip the line, the woman at the desk (though she was skeptical) and the people that assisted my mother to the plane.

When we arrived to Lisbon there weren't any problems, the problem was when we were leaving.

To the staff: If you don't like to help people don't work in service. You made an already stressful situation even worse.

The people in Lisbon were very kind, so it's a shame that the staff was awful at the airport.",1
THE POOR ORGANIZATION OF LISBON AIRPORT ALMOST LEFT ME WITHOUT VACATION TO HONDURAS AND IRRITATED ALL MY YOUNG CHILDREN HUNGER,"The other day I was going to Tegucigalpa with my 13 little children and they almost got a bummer because of the poor organization of the airport. We were about 45 minutes locked in a bus that moved like 4 meters every 5 minutes we entered 16 minutes late to the flight we had and the flight attendant told us that one more minute and the plane took off 🛩️🛩️🛩️. We wanted to buy a quick ham sandwich but it was not possible and my little children gave me the bar on the flight because they were hungry. I'm not going to visit Lisbon because I don't want to set foot in that airport again. Go well in advance and caution through that airport because it will fail at the most opportune time to annoy you travel, flight or vacation 🏞️🏕️🏞️🏕️.",1
Crappie airport,The worst airport i ever experienced. Literally always planes leave late always some kind of problems with the airport landing and taking off. Some areas of the airport doesn't have airconditioner. No signs to point you where you can find certain things. Even if you find some help they are clueless. So if you go through lisbon make sure you have 4 hours at least otherwise you screwed.,1

You get to Terminal 1 and you have no signs of how to get to Terminal 2. You eventually find out from someone by asking around that there's a shuttle bus. You get there and you have to hurry and get a seat before they run out. There are far too few seats and charging stations.
Food and drink is pretty limited. I would say that the airport terminal is a real disgrace.",1
Avoid Lisbon airport,"Lisbon airport is so badly designed and with long walks it’s just a total mess. It’s hard to know where to start. We left an iPad on the plane and were told to go to lost and found.. 40

Lisbon Airport Taxi Rip-Offs,"BEWARE of taxis at Lisbon airport. Long queues and then total SCAMS. Taxis are out to rip off tourists, charging 3x the normal fares usually. Taxi driver prey on tired tourists (after a long flight and then a long queue) and once you get into the taxi, they drive off quickly and you are trapped. Ubers costs around EUR 10 and even if surge about EUR 14. We were charged EUR 33. Difficult to argue. From then onwards, we only used UBER. Our trip from the hotel to the airport on UBER costs EUR 9.90.",1
Lisbon airport queues are ridiculous!,"Avoid Lisbon airport until they sort out the queues at passport control. The wait on arrival for non-EU passports was an hour and 50 minutes, almost as long as the flight. In comparison, coming back to Manchester took 32 minutes from landing to exiting Terminal 1, and that included waiting for hold baggage.",1
"Don’t use Sutransfers Lisbon for your airport transfers, very poor.","We booked return transfers from Lisbon Airport to Jupiter Hotel in Lisbon we paid in advance about 3 months in advance around £45 pounds. The transfers were via SUNTRANSFERS - Lisbon ( DO NOT USE this company) , Our plane landed on time.
However it took nearly 2 hours to get through Lisbon Passport Control (Diabolical)
and then 30 minutes to find our Suitcase (cases were scattered all over). Don’t go to Portugal Lisbon the airport is discriminating against British tourists it took all the brits 2 hours to get through, Dutch people were getting through within 15 minutes!! It’s time we treated EU travellers how they treat us!
So having finally got through passport control, surprise surprise No Taxi was there,
I had to phone Sun Transfers and they said he waited nearly an hour. In passport control we had no phone signal whilst in there, I phoned when we got through and told them what had happened, they said it would be 35 euros to send a taxi, I told them to forget it and cancelled our return with them and got a refund of £18!
We got an UBER from the airport to Jupiter Hotel, it cost us 10 euros.
Sun Transfers are allegedly looking into this event?? They will let know the outcome after there investigation and will email me there outcome within 20 days??
What a joke. So the answer is Don’t use SUNTRANSFERS in Lisbon for your Transfers to your hotel or to where you are going. Use UBER more reliable and half the price!!
Better still Avoid Lisbon as their Passport control is a disgrace.",2

Unpleasant experience at the Lisbon Airport,"We are a family with a layover at Lisbon Airport, traveling onward with a connecting flight. This has been the worst experience ever. When going through security, we encountered two female security guards shouting at passengers in a way that is completely unacceptable. It is a clear lack of respect. We were treated like soldiers in a war zone. They were speaking Portuguese, shouting ""vai vai vai"" and ""hey hey hey hey"" while angrily throwing our belongings around.

I speak Portuguese, but my family does not. However, we were afraid to respond for fear of the consequences. It was embarrassing, and I have never experienced anything like it. My family was in shock as well. We have no desire to fly through Lisbon as long as this kind of treatment persists.

Passengers are customers, traveling for leisure and paying to have good experiences—not to be treated as if they are in a prison camp. We sincerely hope something is done about their poor attitude and angry behavior, which has no place in an airport. There was absolutely no good service at all.",1

Lisbon airport T2 is the worst place in the world. Cattle for slaughter are treated more humanely!,"Lisbon airport terminal 2 is the worst I have ever travelled from.

We waited over 2 hours to check in, and then sat 2 hours on the plane because of a ""data"" problem. Th captain informed us that he had no information on our take-off time and there was no-one to talk to when he went down to the tarmac to find out what was happening. At the same time, planes were taking off with departure times after ours- selective data trouble I guess.That could have something to do with the incompetence of the check-in woman.

A guide to getting out unscathed; it is not a joke.,"Go with just enough time, not a minute more than is reasonable. I would recommend that you use the metro; no other transportation, no taxi, no Uber, no bagpipes. Go to Aeroporto, Linea Bermella. Use the last euros on the card rechargeable (Explorer). Exit at T1 and walk to the bus (yellow) located on the upper level, without entering the airport terminal lobby, along the sidewalk and outside stairs. This bus, which leaves every ten minutes , takes you free to T2 from where low-cost airlines (Volotea, Vueling, Ryanair etc.) depart (unless you travel on official TAP, IBERIA, etc. lines).
Consider yourself dead.
The waiting and check-in ships (?) are spartan, third world and overwhelming. The shorter the time you can stay in them, the better. You will leave on foot (at least we) to the plane passing through warehouses, passageways and storage rooms. The runway , and take-off.
Security control is not easy either; tapes, trays and hubbub galore. I don't understand that low-cost travel entails this regrettable treatment. Nor does it understand that Lisbon maintains this terminal.",2

Lounges close, elevators are turned off, escalators are turned off, cafes close, and although check in starts at 3am, it is not possible to go through security until after 3,30am.
I have travelled a lot, but this was one of my worst experiences ever!!
TIP....make sure you don't have to spend time in Lisbon Airport after 11pm!!!",2
Scam taxi at Lisbon Airport,"Please be aware when you come out of arrivals. That there are scammers operating. We just arrived, myself and my daughter. It had been an early flight and we were both very tired. A guy approached us and asked if we needed a taxi. We said yes. He took us to a car waiting with a driver. We didn’t even have time to ask how much before he was driving off. It was a 20 minute journey and he charged us 150 euros. Yes I know we should have refused to pay but 2 women in a foreign country they saw us coming!!! I’m posting this as I don’t want anyone else to be scammed by these people. If someone approaches you just as you have arrived and asks the same say no.",1
A long queue (3 hours) but everything was translated into English.,"After standing in a queue at the airport for three hours, we had to wait another half an hour to collect our bags. It was helpful that all the information was translated into English.",2
Most miserable place on earth,"The rudest most horrendous security staff on earth.
They confiscated a face cream that was cleared in London on the way in.
When we came back the staff were shouty, throwing belongings around.
This is truly a backwater staffed by people without social skills.
The cafes are staffed by miserable unfriendly servers.
Avoid if you can",1

DO NOT USE HOPPA TRANSFERS EVER !!,"TERRIBLE service by HOPPA transfers [ SMALLER VAN and no HELP ]

1. Despite their confirmation email stating 6 people , 6 large suitcases and 6 hold on bags , the van could not fit 3 cabin hold on bags
2. Driver refused to put them on the floor on front seat area which was empty.
3. Driver had an attitude from the start that we could not even talk to him as he knew best. He was moody and unapproachable.
4.He orders another car which we had to pay . He then says CASH ONLY . I have just landed and had no time to withdraw enough euros cash for 6 people.
5. They came 40 mins later !!
6. They gave no receipt !!
7. I was reassured it will be sent to my email but nothing turned up at all even 5 months down the line.
8. NO PHONE NUMBERS on the original confirmation email from Hoppa is answered
9. I immediately emailed Hoppa as no numbers are answered stating our experience at the airport and all i received was same attitude from a person answering the emails with say about 15 emails going back and forth with different excuses and different reasons in each email extending over a period of 2 months refusing to help or acknowledge that a smaller van turned up , no help at the airport, had to pay CASH ONLY at the airport , NO RECEIPT provided + promises of it sent on email NEVER TURNED UP !! , NO EXPLANATION why we had to pay CASH ONLY and why we were LIED to that receipt will be provided via email that NEVER CAME .

HOPPA took no responsibility , provided no apology or sympathy to customers who had paid for their service which was never provided and then to TOP IT UP , they had a non sympathic person emailing constantly with with different excuses and reasons on each separate email instead of looking at how to improve a service to a customer who is clearly saying something has gone a miss.

My friend who used their services in Hongkong last year had similar issue with HOPPA . A smaller van turned up for them too !!!
CLEARLY they have an issue and has refused to listen.",1
Awful T2 L,"Nobody on the passport desks while tge queue grows and grows.

Tried to book transfer with a folding mobility scooter,"I contacted Ziptransfers for a private transfer from Lisbon Airport to central Lisbon for Four adults 4 medium size pieces of luggage + hand luggage also a FOLDING Mobility scooter. Their reply was somewhat confusing as they said that they could not accommodate non foldable mobility scooters or wheelchairs. My request clearly stated FOLDING. I re mailed them to explain however to no avail
I am disappointed as I chose Zip transfers as they were top of the Google list and this was to be my first trip abroad with my folding scooter",1
Terminal experience like kettle,"Terminal 2 is very bad. Sanitair before checkin is outside in an external temporary mobile toilet home next to the garbage bins. After getting through safety a way to small waiting area. But wait for the end, after the gate-number is known get in a line to enter the kettle area. Before entering the plane you have to get into glass separated lines like kettle to wait for the walk to the plane. Really long wait before entering the plane. Horrible experience, even for a low budget terminal.",1
No show!,"Confirmation good, day prior Driver communication good however, on the day of transfer the Driver never showed up or was possibly late and we had to obtain alternative transport. We called and message the Driver with no reply until 18 minutes after our booked transfer time. No refund issued!",1

Lisbon Airport Taxi drivers can ruin your day,"We arrived at Lisbon airport late in the evening and decided to take a Taxi to the hotel.Unfortunately it didn't go well.The driver was very aggressive from start.As soon as I opened my mouth to tell him the address, he shouted at me that he can't talk as he had first to get out of the airport area.I was a bit in a shock as I didn't understand what provoked the anger.I kept quiet until he stopped the car, then I tried again.He shouted at me which Lisbon we wanted to go to "" the south? the North?"".I showed him the written address of the place, but he totally lost it and kept on shouting we should speak portugese before coming. He then continued driving for a bit and when I told him that his behaviour was terrible, he stopped the car in the middle of nowhere and asked us to leave.We spent hours walking before finding another Taxi.",1
Our booking was subcontracted out to Uber but I was charged the full price for the booking.,"I booked a ride from our hotel in Cascais to the Lisbon Airport. The day of our booking the driver did not come so I called the transport company and was told an Uber was on the way to pick us up. Unfortunately, the transport company did not provide the Uber driver with the authorization code. After some telephone calls back and forth the driver received the code and we could finally leave for the airport - nearly 30 minutes late. As it turned out, the transport company charged me Eur 55.81 for the ride but they paid Uber Eur 25 (of which the driver got Eur 19). I feel scammed by this company and would not recommend using their service. Just book directly through Uber and save aggrivation and money.",1
The terminal of shame,"The terminal of shame. Compared to terminal 1, it's day and night. People are parked. There is no place to sit. We wait in a corridor like a cattle tattoo.",1
Terrible,"Terminal 2 is fine if you are a goat or cow waiting in line for the slaughter house. There is nothing but queues before going to the gates and once a the gates everyone with their cabin luggage must go throught one of the few shops in the terminal. There are maybe 4 shops, nothing of interest and 3 dining options. No lounges. Every single seat is packed, families are spending hours sitting on the flour. When standing in line for boarding, the line is bend through other gates lines because of limited space in the terminal and al gates are right next to each other.

It's a third-world country terminal, no more or less.",1
Terminal 2 is unsafe!!,"On July 19th 2023, we were traveling through Terminal 2 of Lisbon airport. There was a lengthy queue for passport control and the crowds of people waiting became frustrated with the delays resulting in a huge crush of people and a very dangerous situation unfolded. Any elderly or children in the queue could easily have been crushed and died. There were no airport staff on hand to control the situation. Terminal 2 should be closed until customer safety is assured. Do not use Terminal 2.",1
Lisbon Airport Terminal 2,"Lisbon Airport Terminal 2 is an accident waiting to happen. The volume of passengers using the terminal is unsafe, for its size. However, improvements could be made, with additional seating and more staff to direct passengers. My flight was delayed yesterday evening 7June 2023, and there were families and the elderly who had nowhere to sit. Very hot, and outside McDonald's pretty scary as people crushed together. I felt faint and panicky. I am sure parents with small children were very worried. Whoever manages this terminal needs to step up or go, as they are not doing their job. This is not a one off but a regular occurrence. Sort it out before there is an accident.",1
Valise seule sécurité nul...,"Au terminal T2 une valise seule, j'ai prévenu du personnel à 3 reprises pour une intervention de la sécurité afin de faire évacuer cette valise.

Lamentable,"Ante todo decir que lo primero es, EVITA LA TERMINAL 2. Si te toca esa terminal date por ganado. Apretado, hacinado, sin comida, sin mas posibilidad que esperar tu vuelo en las peores condiciones. Hablando del aeropuerto en si, todos los vuelos se retrasaban o tenían incidencias, no he visto una cosa igual. Lo mejor, es la tripulación, que obviamente no tiene nada que ver con el aeropuerto e intentan mitigar en las puertas de embarque todas esta problemática.",2

NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER,"No one waiting for us in arrivals. Rang the Hoppa contact number, thinking it was the taxi driver. No such luck, it was a switchboard that had no ideas on where to find my driver. Gave up and took an airport taxi. They ripped me off with €25 for a €15 journey but at least I got to the hotel. Subsequently tried to contact Hoppa on the number given with my order. All I got was another (WhatsApp) number which was manned by a dumb robot that told me it couldn't locate my order number.",1

No flexibility,"Our plane was delayed by an hour and we arrived 20 minutes late for the activity.
The group had already left, which we understand but the organizers showed no flexibility or understanding by refusing any reimbursement, even partial of the activity... it was the bachelorette party of one of our friends and in addition to the disappointment of missing this moment, we were unable to replace the activity with another, due to lack of reimbursement.
Don't count on them to fix you or put themselves in your place.",1
Misleading prices on website,"Misleading prices on website. The bike I chose was advertised for EUR 59, when I selected the date for the next day for a 24hr rental period it went up to 67, and at checkout the VAT was added, making the total 90!!! Displaying ex VAT may be legal, but it is misleading and certainly not common practice in Europe, whether you are a restaurant, a hairdresser or a car rental.
Bike was in good condition but expensive.",1
Es ist kompliziert,"Wir wollen an einem Montag 2 Räder für den nächsten Tag buchen. Der Laden ist zwar geschlossen, aber es ist angeschlagen, dass man Online reservieren könne.
Ok, dann online.
Wir wühlen uns durch eine Homepage ohne Filter. Welche Größe bei welchem Rad, welche Schaltung vorrätig ist, muss von uns recherchiert werden. .. Also klicken wir uns durch jedes einzelne Rad. Wie umständlich!!!

Endlich alles im Warenkorb, dann sehen wir, dass eine Kaution von 960€ verlangt wird. Ist ja nicht ungewöhnlich. Aber wir haben mit solchen Deposits schon schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht. Jetzt wäre es toll, wenn wir nachfragen könnten.
Es wird ein Chat angeboten. Ok, dann via WhatsApp weiter. Auf unsere Frage gibt es leider eine Standardantwort mit Öffnungszeiten.
Sonst nichts.
Wir entscheiden uns am nächsten Vormittag persönlich in den Laden zu gehen.
Neuer Tag, aber es wird nicht besser. Der Angestellte sagt, dass es ohne Online-Buchung nicht funktioniert. Also alles auf Anfang: wir klicken uns im Laden durch jedes Bike, denn niemand kann uns sagen, welches Rad in welcher Größe vorrätig ist. Es gibt auch keinerlei Beratung, welches Rad zu uns passen könne.
Zum Glück fahren wir Zuhause auch Canyon und kennen unsere Größe.
Denn wir wollen langsam mal los. Es soll jetzt schnell gehen. Räder und Helme (5€/Tag/Person) in den Warenkorb. Name, Kreditkarte, Handynummer eintragen und schon ist die Bestätigungsmail da. Yeah!
Doch jetzt wird uns gesagt, dass wir eine Stunde warten müssten, damit die Räder fertig gemacht würden. Dass wir angerufen werden, sollte es schneller gehen, ist ausgeschlossen.
Auch die Nachfrage nach dem Deposit bleibt unbeantwortet. Hat der Angestellte nichts mit zu tun. Wird automatisch geblockt/gebucht. Wann der Betrag von der Kreditkarte wieder verschwindet, weiß er auch nicht. …
Pünktlich eine Stunde später stehen wir wieder im Laden. Die Räder auch. Prima! Ein netter Angestellter guckt nach der richtigen Sattelhöhe und wir fahren endlich los!
Ja, ich weiß, Anfängerfehler gemacht: Wir haben nicht gefragt, wie die Schaltung funktioniert. Aber wir wollen los. Die Räder Zuhause haben zwar eine Sram. Diese haben eine Shimano-Schaltung. Das wird doch bestimmt ähnlich sein.
4 Kilometer fahren wir, dann probiere ich runterzuschalten. Ich hab keinen Umwerfer, aber vorne rechts geht es nicht. Ich versuche vieles und gleichzeitig löst sich mein Sattel und ich sitze viel zu tief. Oh nein! Also umdrehen und zurück zum Shop. Da wird uns schnell geholfen. Ich lerne, dass mein Bike eine Sattel-Automatik hat, mit der ich den Sattel hoch und runter stellen kann. Eine kurze Einführung in die Gadgets wäre hilfreich gewesen.
Es ist 11.30 Uhr als wir zum zweiten Mal losfahren.
Die Räder funktionieren gut.
Als wir abends zurückkommen, sagt der nette Angestellte, dass alles cool sei. Wir müssten die Räder nur abstellen.
Ähm, und die 960€ Kaution? Die würden automatisch in den nächsten Stunden zurückgebucht. Da bräuchten wir uns keine Sorgen machen. Vielleicht sind wir ja kleinlich, aber wir hätten schon gern eine Bestätigungsmail, dass die Räder wieder ordnungsgemäß da sind und die Kaution zurück auf unsere Karte geht. Anscheinend ist dieses unüblich.
Damit machen wir den netten Angestellten leider Stress. Er muss telefonieren und etwas ausfüllen. Kostet ihn mindestens 10/15 Minuten Zeit. Klappt aber letztendlich.
Am Ende haben wir für 6 Stunden mit zwei Gravel Bikes (Road Bikes waren und viel zu teuer) und 2 Helmen 88€ bezahlt. BTW: Ein Schloss hätte extra gekostet.
Wir sind zwar Biker und mögen moderne Rennräder. Aber das nächste mal gehen wir wieder zu dem netten älteren Herren im oldfashioned Radladen.",2
Very poor service,"The store has an impressive website trying to actually book via internet proved to be impossible, showing zero availability (regardless of bike type or size)

When in Lissabon, we visited the store, hoping to get more info. We got no info, just that we had to „book and pay first“

We were told that they could not check availability or give us any info - we had to book and pay via their website before they could give us any info …

Bottom line - the store was packed with rental bikes, but the staff were not interested ( or capable) in telling us if any of these bikes could be available…

Despite the fact that the store was filled with bikes",1
Bad customer service,"Didn’t do very well, I was charged 350 euro for a broken chain selector which suddenly went bust. No empathy whatsoever on the issue. Bad experience. Sorry for the bad wrap but its true.",1
Disappointing,"Definitely not luxury. Not many seats, so definitely for a younger crowd. Seating was on front of sailboat. It was extremely hot which may have added to the need for some shade.......Drinks were fine and they were generous with them. Adequate snack, but not all that appealing....
Guides were nice. Overview of harbor with some interesting history.",2
Unexpected Charges Marred Experience,"We had a wonderful time on the boat tour, and our tour guide was exceptional. Their enthusiasm and knowledge made the experience truly enjoyable.

However, we were quite disappointed in Lisbon by Boat because upon arriving at the marina to learn that we would be charged the full adult price for our 6-month-old child. The website did not indicate any charges for infants, and despite mentioning the child in the booking comments, we received no prior notification of the additional 60 euro fee.

Given that infants cannot partake in the food or drinks included in the ticket price, we believe a revised policy would be beneficial. Perhaps offering a reduced rate for infants or clearly outlining infant charges on the website could prevent similar surprises for other families.

We were charged a fee at the marina, allegedly because our boat exceeded the maximum passenger limit. However, there seems to be significant confusion regarding this limit. While the people at the marina claimed a maximum of 16 people, the company website stated 14, and a sign on the boat indicated 12. Our group consisted of 6 passengers (including an infant), 9 additional passengers, and 2 crew members, already surpassing any of these limits. Also, I informed the company ahead of time that we were bringing an infant, so they should have made arrangements for our infant. Given these discrepancies and the fact that the boat was clearly overcrowded, we are puzzled as to why we were charged. This unexpected fee has left a negative impression of the company.

We would have happily adjusted our plans, made other childcare arrangements, or considered a private tour had we known about the infant fee in advance. This unexpected cost significantly impacted our overall budget for the experience. We hope this feedback can contribute to a more transparent and family-friendly policy.",2
WE DID NOT GET ON BOARD. OUR CONCERN REGARDING OVERCAPACITY WAS DISMISSED. IRRESPONSIBLE RISKING LIVES.,"The sail was advertised being a luxury yacht. However, it was an old sail boat. In addition the tour company Lisbon by Boat had overcapacity on board. IT WAS NOT SAFE!! My wife and I are experienced sailors and there was NO WAY that we were goin to take the huge risk.

We told the tour operator and he dismissed us by saying that that is the number of people that they normally carry on board plus the crew.

I AM REQUESTING A FULL REFUND!!!",1
NO sailing - only tour by motorboat,"We had chosen Lisbon by Boat because it was sailing tour - was more expensive by the way than motorboat tour.
Very unfortunate that they don't even bother to actually sail and just go around by motor.
There was enough wind because around us we saw several sailboats doing the sailing. So we felt cheated because we paid more for a sailing trip instead of a trip with a motorboat.",2
Much better religious sites to visit in Lisbon.,"There are far better religious sites to visit than this one. Surprisingly smaller than many other religious sites and frankly quite unremarkable.

The stain glass windows are the highlight of the visit.",2
"Massive Romanesque building, the visit to the Treasury can be saved","On our early afternoon in Lisbon, this is the Cathedral and was the only attraction we decided to access.
From the outside, it appears much smaller than it really is, perhaps because of the rather squat shape and the very ""square"" proportions of the facade, while the interior reveals, not without a little amazement, its actual dimensions.
The premises on the upper level house the so-called ""treasure"", a collection of clothes and various ecclesiastical objects, which we thought might be worth visiting, upon payment of the ticket (not exactly cheap), but in my opinion there was nothing interesting. It is also a pity that the large cloister behind was not open to visitors due to work in progress.
Overall, despite the undoubted architectural finesse of the building, it was half a disappointment.",2
PICKPOCKETS IN ALFAMA,The walk was beautiful but you have been warned about professional pickpockets which happened to me. On the last day so wallet in my backpack. At an unexpected moment after removing it from my chest to go up a flight of stairs they struck. Wait for police station 3 couples and after us w3 more came in.,2
Hellish din,Such an iconic place completely ruined by the ambient noise. What idea to install the ticket office inside the Church 😳,1
No,despite the lisbocard you still have to pay at least 4€. In addition there is a super nice church below which it is totally free!!,1
Unwelcoming inside,"Very beautiful cathedral from the outside. Inside everything is paid and even on the left when entering while there is a passage. Besides, a young woman is there to tell you in an unkind way, and constantly on her mobile phone. Unwelcoming",2
"Be careful, not honest at the ticket office. They say that the ticket gives access to everything, but forget to say that the cloister","Be careful, not honest at the ticket office. They say that the ticket gives access to everything, but forget to say that the cloister is closed. I had asked for a ticket for the cloister, so fundamentally dishonest.",1
Quelle deception !,La cathedrale a ete manifestement completement secularisee. Il n’y manque plus qu’un McDo ou BK. Tres deçu et les gens de l’accueil ne comprennent pas qu’il a pu s’agir (il y a fort longtemps) d’un lieu de priere … une vraie catastrophe ininterressante,1
Schöne Kathedrale,"Äußerlich schöne Kathedrale die wir auf dem Fussweg zur Burg gesehen haben.
Über das innere kann ich nichts sagen, da ich für eine Kirche keinen Eintritt bezahle.",2
“Free” scoldings to spoil your day,"Very unprofessional owner. We cancelled within 10 minutes of tour due to torrential rain we kept hoping would stop and received a long, email reply advising us how inconsiderate we were for making the guide “wait in the rain” for us. First, the guide was presumably giving a tour IN the rain, correct? Second, although it was apparently not soon enough for Mr. Guerreiro, we DID give notice. How many times have tours started late while waiting for someone to show? We thought we did the courteous thing but were scolded like children. When your business model relies on word of mouth, it’s best not to reprimand your customers.",1
Left after not moving for 15 minutes,"Spent 15 minutes listening to the last 5000 years of Portugal's history, spoken at machine gun speed, without moving a step from the walking tour start. We left the group and did a 5hr walking tour of our own. It was supposed to show us the locals view of Lisbon, not a never ending boring history lesson (I love history but that was not the scope of the tour).",1
Disappointing,"A few weeks ago we did a tour with Nicole. She's a very friendly young guide (although she's not a local--she moved to Lisbon from Brazil, if I remember correctly, for college). At the outset she spoke about Portuguese history for a looong time, barely taking time for a breath. She spoke too softly, too fast, and her accent was difficult to understand, so we got about 1/2 of what she was saying. (A young man asked her later on in the tour to please slow down when she spoke, so it wasn't just us.) Not positioning herself in front of everyone meant that she had to turn her head behind her and from side to side, causing us to lose even more of what she said.

I am interested in the history of a place and want that in a tour, but in other cities we have gotten that while visiting their historic neighborhoods and other beautiful or note-worthy sites. During this tour we did visit the Alfama area, which was a highlight, but otherwise walked through a lot of normal or commercial parts of Lisbon. Not what I was hoping for. In another highlight, though, the tour ended at the terrace of Igreja da Graca, which has excellent views.",2
Chill Out versus Guru Free Walks,"We read about this tour company in the Rick Steves Portugal travel book.
We did not enjoy this tour on April 30 given by Dodo, one of 3 names he gave us.
Why?
1. The first 30 minutes of this tour was verbal history. We stood in the often heavy rain while we watched other tour groups move to shelter. The group was large.
2. He doesn't speak to you, he speaks ""at"" you. He never takes a breath. Fast talker!
3. He does not wait for the entire group to assemble at the next stop; thus, if you are not in the front, you miss out on hearing about the next stop.
4. He never took a break, we never sat down, we climbed up and up.
5. At the end, he clearly expected the minimum 10 Euros + per person. Then, he preached to you to post on Instagram, etc rave reviews.

Guru Walks offer a slower, more enjoyable pace and cover the same or similar stops.
We are in our 70s and very active travelers",2
"DISCRIMINATORY AND UNPROFESSIONAL ""OWNER""","Worst, unprofessional, discriminatory company we have ever encountered. Wouldn't let us on tour because we had kids! Guy who claimed to be owner was confrontational and couldn't even give valid proof on their website as to why we weren't allowed to join tour, even though we arrived 12 minutes prior to start of tour. DEFINITELY DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! SANDEMANN WAS AN AMAZING TOUR- GO WITH THEM!!!!",1
Worst tour ever,Worst tour ever. We were turned away because we had children. The “owner” was mean rude and a horrible person. Stay away!!!!!,1
Not a fan of this tour,This was my least favorite tour I took in the 10 days in Portugal. I found the guide to be boring also arrogant. Not sure I believed all his explanations on why people tag the walls as signs of approval. Looks like vandalism to me. The walk was rather strenuous up several steep hills and numerous stairs which should be mentioned in the write up. On a hot day for 3 hours this could be too much for some people. We did stop for a rest room break. Also the tour ends a bit of distance from the starting point requiring one to find transportation back to their hotel or the starting point.,2
Horrible!,What a horrible experience! The staff at the port are not helpful at all! We have been waiting to get our luggage now for two hours and of course we will miss our flight to Madrid.,1
DO NOT take a taxi at the cruise port!,Had a similar taxi experience as previous reviewer. Did not don on us that taxis lining up at the cruise port were just waiting for suckers. Was charged 60 euros cash for a ride that would have cost less than 8 euros with a regular black and green metered taxi. Jut walk a bit out of the port area and hail a regular taxi.,1
Lisbon cruise ship port taxi ripoffs,"Taxis waiting for fares are often very dishonest, Grossly overcharging passengers and then stating that they have no change.
People leaving cruise ships should be especially cautious, as taxi driver know that you have plenty of cash and may be in a hurry to get to the airport, etc.
A couple we know got into a cab without asking what the fare was to their hotel and were charged 32 euros for a taxi ride that normally is 12 euros or a little less. They handed the driver 2 20 euro bills and he said that he had no change.
They had no recourse but to let him drive off with 28 more euros than he was entitled to.

Be careful and always ask the exact fare before getting in the taxi. Ask if he can make change for 10 or 20 euro bills, or make that you have change to avoid being ripped off.

These are good rules for travelers to follow everywhere, but the you should be especially careful at the Lisbon cruise port.

Lisbon does have uber, as well",1
Poor communication,"A disaster! The meeting point guidance was unclear so 10 guests missed the tour. We made it to the restaurant, the food was poor, the entertainment was mediocre. Do not book this trip!!",1
Awful Pub Crawl Tour with Destination Tour in Lisbon,"It is the worst pub crawl tour i have ever attended. I was in pub crawl tour on 20.09.2024 with this company. İ had many pub crowl tour in different cities but pub crowl with Destination tours in Lisbon was awful.

They dont reply the phones allthough it was written on the brochure to make a reservation on phone.
So i had to ask help for reservation from my hotel Reception.

They accept the payment in Advance that i have seen for the first time. Normally it is paid to guide at the the beginning of the tour.

It was expensive tour according to the service was provided.

First of all the meeting point was inside of a hostel. The Door was not open. İ couldnt get inside till someone comes who stays in the hostel. A certain square could ve chosen instead of a hostel.

I saw no one who was waiting for us.By the help of a guest i went to Reception which was on the second floor. I asked for the tour. The Receptionist had no idea. Told me to go upstairs.

When i was there , i didnt see the guide. After waiting 10 minutes the guide arrived. We were 20 people after a while. The guide told ud we would stay there for 30 minutes but we stayed there 50 minutes. I cant say it was a bar. İt was only top of a hostel.

İt was written on the brochure we would go to Pink street where i would like to see much. The guide also told we would see. But we didnt. When i asked he said it is a dangerous area and crowded. But 2 minutes away from the point we stay. I requested if he could show , he didnt accept. In one of the bars where wevwere Cool and the ambiance was good. Allthougt we didnt finish our drinkings the guide told us to go out in 15 minutes. Before he told us we would stay in 3very bar 30 minutes.
He was always dissepearing and come back again.
Because im alone and dont know how to go to my hotel i requested him to.help by finding a taxi. He said "" dont worry i will help you"" .
But when i asked him for returning to hotel he didnt want to help me.
I went to security guards of the club where we are to help ne. And i looked for taxi.
İn the program there were 3 places :
1. Bairro Alto
2. Pink street
3.Docks
We saw only Bairro Alto. The other twp places we didnt see.
The guide's name was MARTINI . For me he was not a guide. He explained nothing about the area. He didnt guide. He only walked through inside the bars with us. That was all. We were always looking for hım not to loose hım in this crowded place. He was like a guest , like öne of the people in the tour instead of a guide. He didnt care about people.

İn the other cities in the pub crowl tour the guide explained the important points about the area where we were walking through.
İn this tour there was nothing.
İt is pity for such a beautiful City like Lisbon.
İ will never choose this company gör any tour again.",1
A tour? Really?,"The description said it was a walking tour for 1 hour followed by dinner at a local restaurant with Fado Music.

Let’s start with the tour. We walked and stopped at two spots to take pictures as they were on top of the hill and in our last stop finally the tour guide opened his mouth to show us a graffiti wall mural representing the Fado tradition. That’s it! That was the walking tour.

After that we went to the restaurant, which lasted 2 1/2 hours where you had to be quiet and not talk to anyone while they were singing. Food was OK not the best.

Our tour guide left the restaurant in the middle of the meal, never to be seen again even though the description said you would return to the original spot were the tour started in the middle of the city.

This left everyone trying to look at GPS to try and find their way back.

Awful, awful, awful!",2
Tourist trap,"The tour guide was good and knowledgeable, music was beautiful but the experience overall felt very cheap. After a short tour you’ll end up at the Alfama Grill where the food is simply awful and the service is just as bad. Half of the people in my group did not even touch their plate. Sangrias took almost an hour to get to us. After the performances the singers will go table to table trying to sell their CDs for 10 euros a pop. The whole thing was just bizarre and laughable, a tourist trap. We did a similar flamenco tour in Sevilla, (albeit without food) that was much higher quality.",2
Tour was cancelled without notice to us.,The tour was cancelled without notice. I need to get a refund. Waited at meeting place for 45 minutes before somebody at the hostel told us it was cancelled. Not a good expetience,1
Should've read the other reviews,"In hindsight, we only have ourselves to blame. We booked the tour based on good avg reviews here, but shouldve read the reviews in detail. Similar to others we were shocked at how rude, condescending and arrogant the guide Rodrigo was.He insulted multiple guests on the tour and barely provided any information about lisbon (and much more about himself!). As others have pointed out, the food is also atrocious. Music was good - but the whole night was ruined by Rodrigo.

Do yourself a favor, do a different tour.",1
"Too much Rodrigo, too little Fado","The “tour” did not begin until quite a distance from the meeting point. This first bit of walking was unnecessary and did not connect to the promised topic. If you are not familiar with Lisbon, know that this will be a steep walk with many staircases and little to no accessibility for anyone with a disability. The info we were eventually given by Rodrigo was, in fact, interesting, but was overshadowed by Rodrigo himself. He was self-important and condescending. He also had endless negative things to say about Portugal, a country we very much enjoyed visiting. Perhaps he was trying to be funny? After an hour and forty minutes, we arrived at the cafe. We were seated 10 cm from the performers in a very cramped setting. Rodrigo then transitioned from tour guide to annoying waiter. The food was, unfortunately, atrocious. Finally, the promised singing began. After only two songs, the performers walked table to table trying to sell us their CD’s. Still hungry, we attempted to make our escape between sets, only to be chased down by Rodrigo wanting us to stay for desert. No, thank you. While walking around after the show, we encountered other members of the tour, who also lamented the awful food.
By all means, go to Lisbon to learn about and listen to Fado. But don’t do it here, and don’t do it with Rodrigo.",2
"Burla - Encomenda nunca confirmada, chamadas não atendidas e dinheiro retido","(PT) Efetuei uma compra e, no próprio dia, enviei o comprovativo de pagamento.

Volvido um mês e após várias tentativas infrutíferas de contacto telefónico, enviei e-mail a cancelar a encomenda. Não responderam, como era expectável.

Burla on site.,"I did not go physically but I tried to place an order on the site.
This store does not send any emails confirming the order. After getting me answered the phone once, the employee said that he would send me the order that day.
I waited a few days, no orders were delivered. I'm trying to get in touch with the store and I'm systematically disconnected. Refuse to answer and respond to emails. Oh, bad. For me this site is a jerk.",1
Not really worth it,"A souvenir from every country I travel is a bathing duck. I have also been to various dug stores to buy a special squeaky duck from the respective country. I was disappointed with the store in Lisbon. We didn’t happen to walk past it, but walked there with Google map. Difficult to get up hills and down hills to not get a duck at all. Not one country/city duck existed. Very annoying. Lisbon was still beautiful.",1
Disappointed,I’ve tried to visit the store three times. It was never open. There were no messages to the customers. I’m really disappointed.,1
Avoid!,"We took a private tour with Captain Manel and Sandra on a larger boat—4 hours for 690 euros. The boat was in great condition, everything worked well, and Captain Manel is probably the most stylish fishing guide I’ve ever met.

Unfortunately, the fishing experience was far from acceptable. Slow fishing is normal—it happens. But what made it disappointing was the lack of effort. The Captain spent most of the time talking to Sandra or on his phone, instead of trying to improve the experience by changing bait or location more actively.

He only changed location twice, and that was after we complained. In the end, he showed us how to bait a hook and then stepped away from the process completely. We had a few short sessions and that was it.

Overall, the value for money was almost negative.",2
Extremely hot buses,The bus was extremely hot. They advertised that all their buses have air conditioning but none of the drivers turn on the AC.,1
"Oh, bad!!!!","Oh, bad. Buses take a long time to pass and not always fit the people who are waiting. It takes 30 minutes for the other one to pass. Do not meet schedule, do not recommend and never picked up this type of transportation. Very bad.",1
Worst experience,"This is the WORST EVER tour that I have taken in my whole life. And I’m not that young and have taken a lot of tours. What made it so so so terrible was the driver. The rudest person ever. Change your job, or please, fire him! He drove recklessly, honk that horn to every car and human on the streets, and the cherry on the cake: before leaving the bus in one station, we were going to ask a question and he held his hand and said “I don’t have the time to answer questions or recommend anything.” I don’t know his name, but he was the driver of the 12:00 bus leaving from Marques de Pombal in Lisbon. My recommendation is simple: fire him.",1
Avoid grayline red bus tour,"Red bus ‘grayline’ tour was terrible! Commentary on the bus was so poor-pre recorded, often off sync with the stops, often telling you after the stop what you should have got off at & too much music rather than information. Also completely unreliable-we ended up walking from the castle as the bus didn’t turn up!",1
Would not recommend,"Told pickup would be in 25 min and it was an hour and half later. Bus could only take 5 waiting and no details of next bus arriving to pick up the many others waiting. Would not recommend using in Lisbon city. Another company had three buses arrive during that time,
And very hard to use there sight to find pick up areas and your location.
Bus driver very nice under the pressure that was out of his control.",1
You’d be better off walking!,"Great trip if all you want to do is go around in circles and not get off the bus. Most of the audio was faulty and the frequency between pickups was so bad that we were able to walk 4kms to the next stop and still beat the bus (which meant pick up was over an hour later).

Probably why all the other Red buses are full and these have plenty of seats.",2
Disappointment,"We bougnt a ticket online for 48 hour tour, but were no infos about sport event, so they have finished the tour that day at 13.30!!!!!

One tour the bus beoke down in the middle of the traffic, was waiting 30 min to re-start!!!

Finally we lost our tickets on the boat, than we tried to use the last round showing the voucher, with no success!!!!

We were declined from the bus!",2
Don't bother!,"This was the worst HOHO bus I've EVER been on!! There was very little commentary and what there was was over really annoying music, which was on constantly, even when there was talking. What commentary there was was repeated over and over again! It also took sooooo long. The traffic lights in Lisbon seem to be constantly changing to red so you feel like you're going nowhere fast! The blue route seemed to go on forever, and that was with missing out one of the main stops. Also if you're going from the port be aware that you are taken to stop one first which takes nearly an hour and that's before your route actually starts. You can get there in 10 minutes on the subway. All in all, a MAJOR disappointment!",1
Simply the worst,"By far the worst HOHO bus we have used anywhere in the world. We have found most great but this one (the red bus but others said the yellow bus was also poor) was terrible. The route was slow, seemed to go off track as we spent some time hurtling down a motorway, and almost no commentary. I heard the same music about 10 times.
We intended to do both routes but couldn't wait to get off and explore this wonderful city on foot ourselves. We wasted over two hours on this bus and saw little and learnt nothing.",1
Disappointed victim.,"If u want to spend 4 hrs stopped at traffic lights this is the trip for you. No time to hop off.
Avoid if you need to get back to cruise ship.",1
Disappointment and a real nightmare.,The blue line is a real kidnapping. Over 2 hours of anguish in the outskirts of Lisbon with vision of buildings under construction and state road as the ring roads. The far periphery without the possibility of being able to access a taxi service to immediately go back. A nightmare and a great waste of time,1
"Do not recommend this tour, sold under false information","Advised before tour it would take one and a half hours for tour A, where we change to tour B for returning to cruise ship. From port it took 50 minutes. Tour actually started at stop 1, there was no commentary, so at stop 3 a couple of us went to complain. Bus driver said we were on the wrong channel, started driving again, he said he'd check at next stop, refused to stop for us to make our way back up stairs. We arrived at stop 4 one hour and a half after start. He did not reset commentary so a group of passengers left the bus. Complained to rep at the stop, who told us to talk to the bus driver, who was not interested. No rep at port. I have Complained to company who claim there was commentary, an obvious lie.
No voucher or refund offered.",1
STAY AWAY!!! Go with Grey Line company.,Got on a bus and paid $108 Euro. Went 2 stops and got off at the zoo. Went to get back on the bus but waited over 1hr 30mins for the bus. Never showed up. Ended up getting a taxi back to our hotel. Total waist of money. Grey Line bus passed our bus stop 4 times. Stay away from this company. Told me they would send me a refund but still waiting. Horrible experience.,1
Disappointing!,"The worst visit with this company!
At several places on the bus the headphones did not work. Very succinct comments not to say non-existent! When there was a comment it was almost inaudible and especially out of step with the sites or monuments concerned.
Very disappointed compared to our previous experience ..... 6 years ago",2
This is a scam,"The worst hop on hop off bus experience. It is a scam. Zero information, which means you are just pating the money to drive you around. Through the whole round there may be 3-5 phrases in your earphones. Funny. As I undertand the yellow buses are better but the sightseeing red ones is just a scam.",1
No Greyline,"No Greyline. They cheat. We went for a longer trip service. After the bus has left and 15 mins out of city, they announce not all places will be visited. If this is not cheating what is?",1
worst hop on tour ever,"we try to take these when we are in a city somewhat or brand new to us. we did this in Lisbon, and only stayed on the whole way as many areas were closed on a Sunday so stops were not made. We think these are a great way to see the city but on this one tour, the driver was very rude and completely uninterested in anything to do with the passengers. He should be fired.",2
Frustration,"The first thing I have to say is that it was the worst experience in Portugal. We arrived in Lisbon after a week touring the country and enjoying it. We thought that because of how big Lisbon is, the bus would be good option, since we were only one day. Nothing further from the reality... it only served us to take us to Belem and to return, we had to wait for a great time, once in El Centro, it was disastrous!!!!!!
We didn't find the pickup points and didn't even see any buses
Great frustration for spending 64 euros on something that is not worth anything.",1
Underground bad,"What a mess. Even zero points would be well-intentioned.
We have often travelled with this company throughout Europe. Actually always quite ok, as you can get a quick overview of the city.
The buses are in very poor condition and half headphone jacks are broken. The audio is way too quiet.
Twice we waited an hour for a bus and nobody came.
Save the money and ride the metro or taxi...",1
Weak,"As an expensive bus ride ok, but don't expect much; Chaotic, different providers, tone bad, spoken often doesn't match location; permanently boring music, dull...",1
"Horrendous, Waste of money & time","Awful, infact horrendous. Don't waste your money. Although, I feel Citysightseeing Hop on Hop off won't care and don't care as they don't read or respond to any of these reviews on here whatsoever. Terrible audio. Party of four of us paid €120. Red, Green & Blue routes. No audio, crackling headset sound, couldn't hear anything. Music mainly and then the audio would work and say a few words when it worked. Terrible.",1
Grayline is not on its game in.Lisbon,"We have done multiple Grayline tours and usually find them informative and well-run. In this instance, we had no audio for nearly 2/3.of the trip. We drove through Lisbon not knowing what we were seeing. The brochure is quite skeletal and not informative. Our driver didn't make any effort to assist, we could have had a robo-driver. We considered hopping off to wait for another bus, but it was standing room only, so we thought we.might be stranded for hours. The narration didn't sync with the stops. There was.one.point where a large urban greenspace was touted and there was no tree in sight. Long periods of music with no narration. There.was no explanation as to why most.of the stops were noteworthy. Really below average and not satisfactory",2
Very bad,Very poor knowledge of Lisbon’s history. They don’t have much to say around the city. Lots of music. Wouldn’t repeat. Very hot,1
Terrible experience,The red bus tour from the port in lisbon was awful no audio information about the tour if that's how it can be described most of the time we were stuck in traffic not seeing any places of interest at all the tour cost us 30 euros each what a total tip off.,1
Poor city sightseeing in Lisbon.,"Very disappointing. There are 3 routes: red, blue and green. The red and green routes were far too similar. The blue route was a waste of time. Generally there was a great lack of audio concerning Lisbon and no announcements when we reached bus stops. The drivers race through the city forgetting they have passengers. Cannot be recommended.",2
Don't spend your money on this,"Terrible experience.
Little to none information given on the city of Lisbon.
Long waits in traffic.
So bad I can't believe this cost 30 euro each.",1
Horrible,"Not worth the money
Very poor service spent the whole time in traffic staff rude no clue what part of lisbon we were in
Shocking absolutely shocking",1
Poor experience,"Slow service with limited information
Would not recommend unless you want to waste your time and money. Competitors service much better and punctual.",1
Horrible Redline Bus Lisbon,"Don’t catch de redline in Lisboa, terrible services, I haven’t had the pleisure to take the Greyline, but it seems to be more puntual and very profesional.",1
Use another company!!!!,"As other’s have said, I wish I would have read the reviews first. Didn’t because we take these hop on hop off tours all the time when traveling and never had a problem. So to confirm what everyone else is saying, it was not good. Mostly music on audio. Broken audio ports. BUT that would have been okay. It just never came back for over an hour. We stood waiting in the hot sun, watching two other bus lines go by us constantly. As in they were running on time. I finally called City sightseeing and was told that there was construction in Lisbon. Funny since we had already done part of the tour IN the actual city before getting off AND the other bus lines were running frequently. When I asked how they expected people they had dropped off to get back the agent responded that they make no guarantees. Don’t use this company. You will waste time. The Grayline company was one that kept going by. Try that one",1
poor choice,The Greyline hop on hop off bus is terrible. We waited at the stop to transfer to Cascais rounte for over an hour and no bus showed up. Save your money,1
"Useless, don't buy","Same crappy experience as others - playing music all the time instead of narrative, very few busses running, drivers don't announce anything. Other reviewers complaining about audio jacks - believe me there's nothing to listen to even if you find a working jack.",1
Waiting times too long,"Sometimes you have to wait over an hour for the bus, even though the website says that it's every 30 minutes. You don't learn much about the city, but there's annoying music. Every other socket doesn't work properly. I would use a different provider in Lisbon than CitySightseeing.",2
Maulkorn about review,"Since I have recorded a second negative review about the Sighseeing Lisbon mail contact, it was not published by Tripadvisor",1
Stay away do not use this Service,"Only had a little time in Lisbon so thought we would use this to see the city quickly and listen to the information and learn a little. We bought our tickets on line and had them ready to get on the bus. $84 cdn! We stood in line for 30 mins while people were buying tickets as they got on the bus and the bus driver was struggling with this and was telling people they should buy the tickets at the office or online. We finally loaded then waited another 20-30 mins for them to load the bus. WE Finally started moving and we waited patiently for the information to start playing as we drove through Lisbon. After about 10 mins there was still no information, I got up and talked to the driver and he said he was sorry there was nothing he could do??. So we paid $84 waited close to an hour to leave the start location. Then we had no information as it was not working. then we got off the bus about 15 mins into the ride and wasted a good part of our Day.
We reached out to the Company and they reviewed this and were happy to refund us 10%. Really you have got to be kidding me!!",1
Bad experience due to reckless and rude people,"I recommend not purchasing these packages, they are useless and wasteful, furthermore, where they offer the boat tour on the Taro river, consider that it is nothing more than a little trip without an audio guide and without any explanation from anyone, the boat is open, it has no cabins and there is air everywhere, 4 of us got bronchitis. The staff who manage the company from the moment the tickets were delivered are rude and uncaring.",1
Just don’t do it!!!,"I think that this company has just 1 bus. You’ll wait for hours at any point. Just don’t take this company, you are faster by foot.",1
Don’t take the bus,"They don’t tell you when you buy your ticket at the boat dock that it will take over an hour and a half to get to the first stop on any of there lines (red,green or blue). The only ear piece that worked where we sat was 1 out of four connections. Our daughter could not find any working at the top deck. The one that did work never said much but played Portuguese music. Watch for you stops or you will miss them. I could go on but I think you get the picture.",1
Waste of time and money,"Terrible. Waste of money. Do not ever use them.
Audio didnt work only play Fado music. Driver doesn't make announcement of stops.
You had no idea where in the city you are .",1
HORRIBLE. Avoid this company!,"Horrible!!!! The ""Yellow Bus"" is not great but ANYTHING is better than the CitySightseeing Red Bus (""City"").

I booked this ""Hop-on/Hop-off"" Tour. Hah!! It is nothing like that. At 9.20AM I was at one of their stops. After over an hour and a half no ""City"" bus showed up. At least 4 Yellow Buses went by and several other ""LisbonSightseeing"" buses (that are also Red) went by. And I waited.

After waiting until 10.45 AM I gave up and purchased a Yellow Bus tour....at least they had come by several times. That tour was ok.

Subsequently, I contacted ""Customer Service"" at ""City"" and enclosed a summary of my terrible experience with them, included a photo of myself standing by the bus stop, a copy of my paid invoice, and a copy of the invoice that I paid to the Yellow Bus Company.

I expected ""City"" to apologize and refund my payment. Instead they told me that their service was operating normally that day and that the first pick-up at THAT bus stop was at 11 AM. Really? Not exactly Hop-on/Hop off, right? Anyway they told me that no refund would be forthcoming....too bad sucker!!!

I will be protesting this charge with my credit card company, and I am quite sure my credit card company will reverse the charge.

If ""City"" was a decent company they would have apologized and refund my payment and saved me, and them, the headache of dealing with a contested charge.

AVOID THIS COMPANY!!",1
Bad,"Bad experience. They have even poor routes because they don't explain anything. One has to guess where the stops are. The audio is almost just music, it's guessing everything. Very bad service at the main station to get on the buses. Appalling....",1
Disappointing - take the other company!,"Echo other reviewers and wish I’d read them before booking. Terrible almost non-existent audio (just music playing). Long wait times (watching 4 of the other company pass), no information.",1
No way!,Very little information about the city and you have to wait almost an hour between buses! Never had such a bad sightseeing bus!,1
Terrible is an understatement,"It's terrible, we were never able to go up to use the service, you wait and wait, they arrive at any time…. Except the one they're supposed to say it is. Don't buy it, you'll spend your time standing in line instead of reading the city. We never use it, the most efficient is an Uber or walking",1
Don’t bother,"Not good. There is barely any audio, it is mostly music, and the audio that they have is very sparse and never plays at the right time so it is impossible o know what they are talking about. When you buy your ticket online it is challenging to find out where to meet the bus as no information is shared with you at the time of purchase. Disappointing for sure.",1
Not Impressed,"Lisbon City Sightseeing Hop on Hop off was a disappointment primarily because of an outdated, in need of repair audio system, the lack of commentary and the wait times at various stops. Buying tickets to The Monastery and Belém Tower was not beneficial in the least. Wait times were at least 1 hour at each. A good way to get around the city but a look with nothing to listen to trip.",1
Lisbon sight seeing tour,"My wife and I were only in the city for a few days, so we thought we'd take a sighting tour. We paid for two trips, the red line and blue line, at one of the bus stands. We were told where to go to get the bus, and after waiting an hour and 40 mins we were informed that the bus wasn't coming, but our tickets would be valued for the next day. So we got up early and took public transport to where the sight seeing tour starts it's journey. We did not really have a long wait for the blue line tour, we put on the headphones provided and sat back waiting for the commentary to begin. I can't say exactly how long we were on this tour but it seems like a very very long time. The commentary only came on a few times, telling you about a few places we couldn't see or had past by, and the rest of the trip was filled with Portuguese folk music or Fado music as they call it being played into our headphones. The whole experience was so bad that I offered my wife £100 not to make me take the trip on the red line. She told me to save my money as she didn't want to go through it again.",1
City sightseeing bus tour in Lisbon,The city sightseeing bus was a major disappointment. We got on the red bus which was ok. They are supposed to stop at each stopping point at least every hour which is too long to wait. In Barcelona there were many buses and stopped every 15 minutes so you never had to wait long. The blue bus was the worst. The driver drove with two feet so it felt like stop and go which caused me motion sickness. The audio tour guide didn’t give much information during the trip. It was a waste of time. I won’t use this bus tour again and don’t recommend it.,1
Bad experience. Lost time,"Don't take it. You will spend more time waiting than visiting the city. It is assumed that at the stops that coincide the purple and red lines they run every 30 minutes... well no.
In several seats the headphones do not work.
I recommend the Light Seeing (Grey Line) competition with more modern buses and much more frequency between them.",1
Incredibly bad,"Booked due to bad weather despite the many negative reviews. The option with a red/purple/blue bus line was chosen. There is a draft everywhere on the buses. Drivers drive very recklessly, especially towards pedestrians. The rest of the staff is mostly unfriendly. The red and purple bus routes differ little and little information is provided. You can mostly hear annoying music. The highlight, however, is the blue line: it took us almost 2 hours and we mostly drove past social housing blocks. Absolutely horrible offer and a waste of time and money.",1
Take th other company,"Several other sightseeing busses has passed us, but citysightseeing buses no. Waiting time is one hour, instead of 30min. Ir wouls be nice to wait in a cafe, but no schedule for busstops is avalable so we just standardi and wait.",1
Do not book / Reserve in advance,"Do not book in advance. Terrible service. The queues are long and if you decide not to use the service you will have a hard time to get your money back.

Grab one of the friendly Tuk Tuks. Much better service for a comparable price.

I cannot stress this enough. DO NOT BOOK/ RESERVE in advance if the links is here.",1
Very disappointed with very long wait times,"We were very disappointed in our experience. The buses were so infrequent we never did catch the bus we wanted and had to switch to another company. Wait times were way too long for a young family and timing was not posted. Make sure you read the fine print before choosing your company and route, especially in the shoulder season.",1
Complete Rip-Off - Avoid !!,"Purchased ticket online. Staff at cruise port initially didn't know what to do so missed the first bus..

Got on the next at 1.15pm and sat there for over 30 minutes.

The red route bus then made it's way to the Terminal area - there was lots of music but hardly any commentary.

We got off the bus and stood at the Terminal waiting 40 minutes for the Blue route bus.

By this time a large crowd was waiting in total confusion on what was happening, but there were no staff anywhere - though there were lots of staff and lots of tour buses for rival gray line.

A bus arrived and we checked with a staff member who confirmed it was the Blue Route so we boarded.

At this point we noticed that City Sightseeing did have 3 staff at the Terminal - they were the disinterested 3 people standing away from customers and chatting between themselves.

The ""Blue line"" bus then left and made it's way back to the cruise terminal - it was the rong bus we'd been told to get on.

Even the commentary was lacking on their too, and when there was some it didn't relate to where we were.

We had spent from 1pm to 4pm and did not get what we had paid for.

We did not risk going back to the Terminal as our ticket expired at 6pm.

A complete waste of money AND our valuable day in the port of Lisbon.",1
Not informative enough - did not run on time - not enjoyable,"As an ex - employee of Belfast City sightseeing, I and my family were very disappointed with this service in Lisbon. We traveled on two occasions to Belem, Sunday and Monday 17 and 18 March 2024. Firstly the buses were not on time, they were old and dirty, the plug in points for the audio did not work ( very poor). The information from the audio was terrible, did not mention the stops and gave very little information of the City. Why do you not have a personal tour guide on the bus? It is hard to beat the human touch! Your competitor the Gray line seems to be a better service with more modern buses and much better facilities. My family and I were very disappointed and felt the whole service was not value for money. You need to do better and up your game.",2
Bad info,"Re HOP ON HOP OFF BUS you must avoid the company ""City Sightseeing Portugal"" in Lisbon. We had a 48-hour-ticket for red, purple, blue & green lines and it was a total disaster. Hardly any info as ear plugs system didn't work, rude driver, old buses and no info about dep.times en route. In 2 days we only managed the purple and green line as buses never showed up at stops.",1
Wasted money,"Terrible experience! Waste of money, the bus frequency is really poor so if you get off you risk not seeing another one pass for a good two hours. The audio didn't work and the last bus leaves at 5pm!!! We had to return by taxi",1
Avoid them at all costs,"My wife, friends, and I bought tickets online and went to the bus stop (stop 6 on the blue line). And then...the bus never came. We called, we used the online chat...both said the buses were running but couldn't tell us when a bus would come. We'd been waiting over an hour, so saying the bus runs every hour was a useless response. The phone number on their website is in England, and after a bunch of time talking in circles, the woman said she'd find out when the bus is coming then call me back. She never called. We eventually gave up after nearly 2hrs and left. We had pictures of ourselves at the bus stop sign. The company refused a refund, saying we didn't cancel 24hr in advance. Not my fault, since we didn't know you wouldn't show up! They said by email they would investigate and maybe give us a refund. Then, their investigation found that the bus came while we were waiting, a miracle! Somehow it came and we didn't see it! A bunch of lies. My credit card company luckily took my side, demanded proof the bus came during the period I was at the bus stop, and the company had nothing. Imagine if they'd just said ""sorry"" and refunded me the money. I wouldn't be here talking trash about them.",1
Avoid this company,Absolute shockingly poor service. We were unable to use our tickets as after waiting over an hour for a bus it arrived full. Driver informed us another would arrive in two hours. Hop on hop off (what a joke). The company refused to refund so technically stole our money and is doing lovely Lisbon a disservice to local tourism. Moira,1
Avoid!,"Awful service. We waited almost 1 hour for the bus, a small bus arrived that was completely full. We were told we had to wait another 2 hours for the next one. We didn’t want to take the chance in case it was full again and the service would be stopping around that time also.

Requested a refund as we spent €100 on tickets and didn’t get to use the service at all. Refunds declined.

Save your money and avoid!",1
"Terrible waste of money, worst in Europe","Utter rubbish,
If there was a chance to give negative stars I’d gladly do it.
Bus is falling apart, drivers can’t drive, can’t even stop on a red light. Audio doesn’t work in most of the seats. There is NO description of what we should see so 99% of the time you can’t understand what to even look at.
Worst experience out of all countries we took a sightseeing bus. Rubbish and a disgrace",1
AWFUL,"AWFUL. Do not waste your money. We paid 100 euros for our group of five last week, one bus came to the stop and was already full, and we were told it would be 2 hours til the next. Never got to use the bus service since the service stopped a few hours later. No refund since the tour company said it was “clearly stated in website that it was every 2 hours”. How is that hop on hop off? AVOID!",1
Dreadful. Use another tour company,"Dreadful. Use another company.
We waited for over an hour for a bus and gave up and walked in the end.
When I complained to the company I was told the wait between buses can be 2 hours so it’s not ‘hop on hop off’ and simply doesn’t work as a way to see the city, The buses themselves are tired and we struggled to find any headphone sockets that worked. Even when they did the commentary is so short that I don’t feel we got to learn about Lisbon at all.
Other buses like Lisbon Sightseeing and Yellow Bus are more frequent so try them instead. And/or get a daily metro ticket - covers the trams as well and the lift too…Lisbon is great but don’t use this company",1
Total rip off,Paid €54 for 2 tickets. The sound didn’t work in the ear plugs for the whole journey round and the maps were useless. Therefore you had no idea what was at each stop and whether it was worth getting off the bus. The bus was full so we couldn’t move seats and other people had the same problem. I emailed them on return to complain but haven’t heard back from them. Definitely NOT recommended.,1
Lisbon City Sightseeing Portugal,Absolutely shocking service. There's hardly any bus stops available and little sight of buses!!! Total waste of money and our precious time! We ended up walking most of the time. I would certainly not recommend this service for seeing the city and surrounding areas. We're used hop on and hop off buses in many cities and have found them excellent but Lisbon service is a disgrace.,1
"Appalling service, do not use","The first day we went on the bus,we were shuttled to a centre point to catch the bus we wanted. That was ok. The lady that sold us the tickets told us they were valid for two days. On the second they was nobody at the stand in the terminal and no one outside were we had previously caught the bus. We waited for over half an hour,no bus appeared and nobody from the operator. Finally we decided to have a walk instead.
This was the worst experience of this operator and we were left out of pocket as we did not get what we were promised. We used this operator in maderia and cadiz and the service was excellent. Lisbon you had better pull your socks up as I would not recommend anyone to use you.",1
Poor commentary,"I have used CitySightseeing Hop On Hop Off buses in a number of cities, and they have been excellent, and well informative. However, not so in Lisbon. The routes, times etc were all good, but the accompanying commentary was awful. It played painful music when they had nothing to say, and what they did say was poor and infrequent. We learned nothing about an extremely old city, when there was so much to tell!!",2
Absolute waste of time and money,"Absolute waste of time and money. No commentary. The bus only went past each stop every two hours, with no way of knowing what the time-table would be. We had to catch a normal bus to get back.",1
To flee,"I would prefer to put 0! After spending €60 for 2, we receive a QR Code to take the buses
Bus that we wait for more than 30 min at the stops

The first driver gives us a ticket once the QR code is scanned which we do not keep

We made a short trip for a stopover to visit.

What a surprise when I wanted to get back on the bus! The driver didn't let us get back on because we had to show the paper ticket! The online QR code does not work!!!!!

TO FLEE",1
City Sightseeing Lisbon - Red Line Route Tour - RUBBISH,"I have never written a negative review about any travel experience but this tour was beyond rubbish!!!

We were on a cruise and apparently on docking days the hop-on-hop off tour bus comes straight to the Lisbon cruise terminal - we thought great - how convenient. What it didn't tell us is that we would sit, in the cold, for nearly an hour before leaving the dockside. Some passengers sat there for 1 1/4 hours. When you only have a few hours in the city this is unacceptable.

Many of us couldn't hear any narration because the systems weren't working. I had to share 1 ear plug from my husbands headset, so that I could hear some narration. It was the worst guide to a city that I have ever encountered. Many of us on the tour hadn't got a clue where we were on the journey and it didn't tell you when you would be stopping and where you were on the route. I actually started my own commentary as we went along to take away the boredom. It actually made folks smile and was the most engaged many of them were the whole tour.

There are a number of tour buses in and around Lisbon and I'm sure some are better than this. Just to reiterate - the City Sightseeing Lisbon has red, green, purple and blue line routes. We did the red route from the cruise terminal.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY

(ps this was not a cruise-line organised trip)",1
Can't tell you how bad it was,"Terrible service.
I've done countless hoho tour buses all over the world and this one is the worst !

Picked up at cruise port but doesn't return there so be careful.

Commentary is Terrible and not in sync with what you are actually seeing.

THE WORST HOHO EVER ! AVOID",1
Stay away from this hop on hop off buses company,"Horrible experience!! Last time using this company, buses are old, staff not very friendly but the worst part is the lack of reliability. The frequency is totally off- there’s no consistency and no way to track the time that buses are passing by in every stop. My mom and I got stuck at the Belem tower stop for hours, the bus never showed up. We had to Uber back to the center of the city. Personal opinion, don’t waste your money in this company, there are other options to get to see this magnificent and amazing city, Lisbon 🩷",1
Dangerous driver,"So very disappointed. Very hard to find the stop to first get on. Headphones did not work (tried a few ports) so we had no idea where we were or what we were looking at. We joined ½ way round so stayed on to go back to the castle to get off. Drivers changed and the 2nd driver shouldn't be allowed behind a wheel. You could smell the clutch burning. Yes some of the roads are steep and very bumpy but the ride was horrendous, we'd already driven the route once before and no issues so definitely the driver who was also busy talking on the phone (video call) whilst driving.
Think before using this company.",1
Catastrophic,"I gave 1 because you can't give 0. Absolutely avoid, the buses are crap, the boxes to hear the tour don't work, so if you find space the box doesn't work, the staff is super unfriendly , borderline impolite. I've done this kind of tour in many cities, I've never seen it!",1
Pure scam,"Most headphone connections are poor. Old-fashioned buses with smooth tires. We changed to a different company afterward and have not regretted it. In conclusion, be very careful with your choice (there are 3 companies) but actually I didn't read the comments before...",1
Worst City Sightseeing Tour Ever,Absolute waste of money and time. Joined the red route at the cruise terminal and found very limited content and commentary. Spent most of the time driving with no advice of where we were or sites of interest.,1
Worst hop-on-hop-off bus ever,"Very old bus with a lot of noise, a fault in the audio guide could only be partially resolved after the driver restarted it several times. It was very drafty and cold in the bus. When changing from the ""blue"" to the ""red"" line, we had to wait almost an hour at 8°C (the red line is supposed to run every half hour). Another company has new buses with heating inside and a much higher frequency (3 buses with the same destination/route)",1
"It's a scam, don't fall for it","It's a mess, they're pickaxes, there's no sufficient bus and the audio is a continuous fado...don't under any circumstances take this line. 100 euros were wasted",1
City sighting on off bus lisbon,"This was the worse on off bus tour we have taken. Having done 3 previously I was looking forward to this tour. The first thirty minutes we had no commentary. The bus driver rebooted the system and the commentary crackled tgereafter but the music was clear. We tried different seats but no improvement. We were told we would visit the castle but did not. Apparently you had to change buses and pay a separate fare. City Sightseeing ignored my complaint, apparently it was my fault as all the information was on the Internet and I could of used the map. Difficult when we did not know where we were as the stop numbers were not displayed clearly. All in all a very poor tour.",1
Bus trip,Map is awful and hard to find bus stops. Stops not marked. Drivers do not stop at stops. Christmas music is played more than any information being given. For €30 I learnt nothing.,1
Not worth it,"This was our day of arrival activity to get a feel for the city. We purchased the tickets that covered all the routes and only ended up doing half of one. The audio on the bus didn't work well, and on the seats it did work for, there was very little information provided. There is constant music playing with the information spoken over the music. The information also repeats as the bus doubles back on the route. The audio controls did not work well, and it was hard to get it loud enough to hear. We also waited at a stop for 45 minutes before giving up and leaving. The bus was clean, and the attendants at stop 1 were very kind and helpful.",2
Lisbon hop on hop off bus,"4 routes - 3 of which cover the same route, at least partly.
Not a lot to see on the red or purple routes and they take far longer than necessary to do such a short distance.
It rained on the day we used it and we had water coming through the roof/windows and lights.
Most of the headphone jack points not working, and commentary very poor re information given.
Worst city sightseeing bus I have ever used",1
Don’t do the blue!!,"We did the purple and blue routes. Purple was great and went by the coast with great attractions. Blue was too long, very light on content and basically a trip to the old expo park and back.
As with these tours, lack of a real time tracker also meant that 30 mins between buses was a long time.",2
"Very disappointing experience, to be avoided!","Very disappointing experience, starting with the gentleman in charge of tickets who is very unpleasant! What followed was no better, we were treated to fado music the whole way, with barely a few explanations from time to time on the locations and monuments we passed.
A useless, expensive and disappointing tour, to be avoided.",1
This hop-on hop-off option should be avoided!,"You know these tours and the procedures from various cities, but I feel compelled to write something about the Lisbon version here, because unfortunately it falls far short of other tours. We had to constantly swap seats because two speaker systems didn't work on one bench. Sometimes the headphones didn't even fit into the jack and the headphones themselves were also broken, which of course was easy to replace. Two lines constantly drove along the same streets. And there was almost only music playing?! You drove for ages through beautiful areas and weren't told anything. In other cities, you are constantly explained what you are seeing. The green line is driven through the old town in small buses and you should have a strong stomach here. The driver sped up and down through narrow cobblestone streets and rammed the curb several times, so that we had to hold on tight all the time and it smelled of burnt rubber. It was more adventure than sightseeing and seemed anything but safe.",2
An appalling waste of money and saw nothing beautiful in Lisbon,"Four of us, all adults over 60, paid 27 euros each at the Port in Lisbon, having been approached by their salespeople as soon as we got off our cruise ship, The Britannia. We got on the bus and then sat there for almost an hour - it didn't leave until the bus was full, whilst other tour buses left earlier. We finally got going. The earphones we were given droned Portuguese folk music which was okay for five minutes, but it was constant apart from when we were given some pre-recorded information about various sights - the recording must've been out of sync with the location of the bus though, because none of it made any sense in regard to where we actually were and what we were seeing. After about 20 minutes we got off the bus at the cathedral. We were expressly told that another bus would come in about 20 minutes, or after that it would be an hour. We looked around quickly and were back at the bus stop in 15 minutes. We waited there for almost an hour, but no bus came. We started walking the route that the bus would take. No bus showed and in the heat we ended up walking all the way back to the port and the cruise ship, about a two hour walk. So, to sum up, four people paid 108 euros to sit on a stationery bus for an hour, take a 20 minute awful bus ride of the concrete jungle city streets (nothing pretty) and then get off at the 4th or 5th stop at the church. That was it! If I could get a refund, I would. DON'T GO WITH THE COMPANY CITY SIGHTSEEING LISBOA.",1
City Sightseeing Tours - waste of time and money,"City Sightseeing Hop On-Hop Off in Lisbon
One word to describe this hop on-hop off bus tour - RUBBISH!
Actually a few more words - pathetic, rip-off and hugely disappointing!
Started on the Blue Line - driver roared through the town - most uncomfortable - and the commentary was very uninformative - ""on your left, a statue"", ""on your right an old building""...
Changed to the Red Line. The driver kept braking sharply - also very uncomfortable. Absolutely no commentary on the headphones, just a bit of static.
All in all a very disappointing and uninformative introduction to the lovely city of Lisbon - save your money and buy a guide book instead!
P.S.>>> if you sit on the open top deck, look out for the low tree branches - no warnings - they could take your eye out.",1
BAD! RUN AWAY,"The worst of my life!
We have used the service all over the world... never seen such degradation: few buses, rude staff, incorrect timetables... book something else!",1
Absolutely to be avoided!,"We strongly advise against taking this Hop On Hop Off bus.
Especially the blue line lacks any interest, unless you intend to visit the aquarium. The journey really is very, very unattractive and you will waste your time! If you still opt for taking this bus, take the red line.
Furthermore, if it is raining the roof and windows were not waterproof, causing water leaks along the ceiling, windows, and seats. It was a truly unpleasant experience.
Consider opting for a tuk-tuk or purchasing a bus and tramway ticket. These options provide a more enjoyable transportation experience.",1
Sightseeing Portugal lied to us.,"THEY LIED TO US.
Two hours they said. We got on at 9:30 am and enjoyed driving around the city of Lisbon.
At around the two hour mark we turned away from the waterfront where our cruise ship was docked within sight and began climbing into the hills again.
It is now 12:55 and they parked in a bus lot. PARKED.
When we asked when they were gonna take us back to the ship they pointed to another bus. When I asked that driver how long to the ship he said one hour.
ANOTHER HOUR!
I'm done with Lisbon. We had a couple other things on our itinerary other than being held captive on a bus for what will be about 4 hours before we are taken back to where we started.
DO NOT TRUST SIGHTSEEING PORTUGAL IN LISBON.

PS. The driver also broke off a 10 foot long arm sized branch that fell on 4 passengers. Didn't stop. Didn't even ask if they were OK. SMH...",1
Poor experience,"Information poor, sent on blue line which was 2 hours of nothing, waited over an hour for another bus route, buses not regular and commentary did not work bought a 2 day pass but binned it after day one, had a better day walking",1
AWFUL!!!,Awful!!! Don't bother wasting your time and money!!! 45 mintirs wait for a bus to come along and their commentary doesn't work!,1
Poor service,"Map for cruise connection is incorrect. Have to get our at 5 rather than 6.
Service is unreliable. App only works on older phones. No information on bus movements available.",1
Don’t do it!!!,"Do not waste your money. Terrible. Blue line is so boring and a waste of time. Commentary is poor.
So disappointed. We also did a tuk tuk tour which was more expensive but sooo much better value.",1
awful,"We paid 27 euros each for 48 hour access to this 'hop on, hop off' bus and managed to get a grand total of one bus. They were no where to be seen ! I struggle with mobility issues and needed this to get around but we waited for hours in total at various stops. When the buses eventually turned up we were not allowed on them even though there was space. A total waste of money. Do not use this company. I have tried to complain but have been unable to find a way as the website doesnt have Lisbon as an option. We bought the tickets from inside of the cruise terminal so thought it was a legitimate business. Trust me, it is not.",1
Terrible - Portuguese tourist agency you should be ashamed of our first experience of Lisbon,"Absolutely terrible, busses every hour. time to get off look round and then have to wait one hour for the next bus. Would take two days to stop at each site if you wanted to get on and off. Guided tour earphones didn’t work.
Driver was miserable. Wish I had looked at reviews first!",1
Not that good,"I was a bit disappointed having bought the 2 day 4 line ticket for our party of 3. The Blue line is a waste of time as there is very little of interest on the route and the Purple and Red lines overlap. The Green route is through very narrow through winding streets that would be better walked and the Red coastal route is served by tram. In addition the commentary is sparse and mostly filled with music. If I had my time again I would buy a travel card for €6.50 per day which gives access to all public transport across Lisbon, including the rickety old trams",2
Don’t waste your time or money,"We could not have been more disappointed than with this “tour”. These are the red Lisbon Sightseeing hop on/off buses you see frequently. We purchased our tickets at our hotel and made our way to the “bus station”. We waited 25 minutes for the first bus for the Belem red line tour, which goes riverside. We had paid $26 Euros each.

Once onboard, we quickly learned there are no fans nor A/C on the bus, so try to navigate to a seat with a side window, if it’s warm. Next, the displays for you to choose your language of choice were so poorly lit, we had to get on our knees to read it. The English translation one was a joke. I felt I was listening to Diego from the Dora the Explorer cartoon. He gave VERY little information about the stops. As an example…”Museums are great places to learn new things”. Really?? Next, the stops were out of sync with the speaker so you’d arrive sevminutes later to the clock pointed out previously or try to guess which place had been spoken about . It was so bad. Also, there was music playing the entire time between what little information given. I stopped listening completely.

Last, it was SO bad that few people“hopped off” at all, since the stops and information was out of sync. We were concerned that with full buses, we wouldn’t get a seat on another bus.

I’d give it a zero, one is too generous.",1
Use another service.,"Poor buses. One driver was really aggressive to other used and really didn't care about passenger comfort.

Many of the audio outputs didn't work.

Infrequent services. Others were running 2 or 3 to this one.",1
Worst sightseeing,"Drinks are not allowed to be taken away, staff are unfriendly, waiting times are long, guests are mostly old and very unfriendly, it's just not enjoyable under any circumstances!
Otherwise it's actually quite OK.",1
Our experience has been horrible!,"The service is horrible! We bought a 72-hour ticket. The bus, which is supposed to run every 20 minutes, doesn't run. We stayed at the stop for 45 minutes waiting. We had time to catch the bus that left for Cascais, but we missed it by 2 minutes because the bus didn't arrive. The boy's response is that the bus always leaves on time, that what we were waiting for was on time. I wanted my money back, but the queue was long and my husband convinced me to take another bus and amazingly... it was supposed to leave at 11:20 and it left at 11:24... two weights, two measures.
The information we had from the driver of this same operator is that the bus would pass at 10:20 am at the stopping point on the other side of the street.
Something is wrong. But if I can give some advice to those of you who are reading, buy from other operators, I wanted to change and I was wrong. I never had a problem with the other, better-known operator!
Ahhh and the delay wasn't just one day and not just once.",1
Use Yellow bus instead!,Waited for over an hour and didn’t see any buses for the blue line (castle). Saw 1 mini bus (as opposed to full length bus) for the green line that was full of course! Take your money and book with yellow bud instead! I’ve used this company in many other cities but Grayline HOHO Lisbon sucks!,1
"Too expensive, little information, long waiting times","Not recommended. Waited far too long for the connecting bus. Incorrect or no signage at the stops. The audio guide rarely said anything, so you could mostly hear loud music.
Ok for a rough geographical overview. But nothing more. Better to invest the money in a tuk-tuk driver who knows the area. This trip brings you much closer to Lisbon.",2
Not recommended,Last day of holiday spoiled by going on the blue line which is pointless and ugly compared to the rest of beautiful Lisbon then being unable to find any of the poorly marked stops. No timetable available and not that frequent. Both our headphones broken in first hour,1
The Worst Ever,"I wish I had read the reviews. They are spot on. The headphones worked intermittently, the volume control didn’t work so you could barely hear anyway, and there was very little commentary only music.
Save your money and book with one of the other companies.",1
Beware of HOHO bus tours in Lisbon,"This is the worst city HOHO tour I’ve ever taken. We began at the cruise ship terminal, charged 27euros each and given a map. The commentary was nonexistent upstairs and intermittent downstairs. Nobody knew where we were as the bus stop numbers fir the red line didn’t match up with the map provided. Never were we told what actual stop we were on. There was NO air conditioning downstairs and it was 12.30 when we boarded. I told the seller that I wanted to go to the Hard Rockcafe and asked her the stop number before boarding. Was told it was either 14 or 15. It took 2 full hours to get there, looking at boring scenery other than our trip to Belem and that was when we finally had a stop after 90 mins to complain to the driver about not knowing where we were. Everyone onboard was very angry and from the cruise ship. It was a dreadful experience and very expensive fir next to nothing. We walked back to the ship from the Hard Rock Cafe,arriving back at 5.20pm. There was nobody at the information desk to complain to as it was now unmanned.
Be very careful buying HOHO tickets in Lisbon.",1
This is a SCAM not worth the 30Euros per person….maybe 5.,"SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Only music 99% of the time in the audio guide rather than having a narrative of the city historic landmarks. Not worth the 30 Euros per person.
When we asked the driver his answer was “the route is new and we need to record the new content….”",1
Absolutely Terrible,We decided to do the HOHO sightseeing tour as it was too hot to walk around. We read the reviews (poor) but decided to give it a go as we had very little time in Lisbon. Big Mistake. Waste of time and money. Hardly any commentary and the timing was out of synch. The numbering of the stops was different to the map provided. My advice would be to use Uber which is very cheap in Lisbon.,1
Avoid the boat unless you want boredom/safety risks,"I’ve used this company in multiple countries, I’ve done hop on, hop off in about 30 cities. This may be the worst.
We moved seats 3 times to find working headphone ports, what little commentary there was repeated itself and was useless.
After struggling to stay awake through the red and green routes we did the bit route. No commentary, no interaction and the boat was shifting so much when they ‘docked’ the was genuine concern as to how we would get off safely.
The boat shifted so much there must have been between an inch and a foot gap as it bobbed up and down.",1
Do NOT use this company-utter rubbish.,"Utter rubbish-do NOT do this tour.

Normally love these bus tours but never had such a rubbish explanation of a city,
The bus was falling apart, people had to move seats because the seats were so wobbly-the ear phone areas on some
Seats didn’t work. Bus driver drove too fast-how so I get my money back? 54 € utter waste.",1
By far the worst sightseeing ever,"Total scam.

They will charge you for lines that are not being served. Buses will run every two hours, they see you running to catch them and will close and leave. Worst investment ever, stay away from this tourist trap.",1
Disappointed to say the least,There are multiple sightseeing hop on hoo off buses and maybe we picked the wrong one. The head sets didn’t work on any of the buses we got on. There was nil commentary to know what stop we were at or when we could cross over to another route. The bus took us to the expo 98 site which was a nothing site and then we thought we timed it right to get the bus back and waited for another 40mins. The bus has highlights on the mal which it doesn’t stop at. The routes have changed and the maps not updated. The information guides just seem to tel you what you want to hear. I would look at using public transport or taxis before buying a ticket in this. The taxis are cheap and most of the drivers can speak English.,2
"Bad, just bad","I am generally a fan of the hop on hop off bus in places I don’t know. But this one is just bad. The headphones barely work and then conk out. When they do work, it’s impossible to see what channel you are on - and many of the actual consoles are broken. If you can actually get the recorded guide, you will find she says very little - and even less of interest. And the bus just whizzes by most stops before you even realize they were there. Not worth it! Just get a transit pass.",1
Kathastophe,"Hab nichts verstanden, da die Audio viel zu leise war. Und es permanent gekratzt hatte. Habs nicht ausgehalten und hab die Kopfhörer weggelassen. Wenn ich so um mich geschaut hab, scheine ich nicht die einzige gewesen zu sein mit dem Problem. Kaum einer hatte Kopfhörer auf.
Haltestellen waren nach Lust und Laune des Fahrers ausgesucht. Teilweise ausgelassen oder n andern Orten gehalten.",1
Terrible service,"Horrible. Drivers don’t announce stops or even stop at them some of the times. We were left several times on the side of the road when the bus literally pulled along side a stop, never came to a full stop or opened the doors. Just kept rolling along if you weren’t standing directly under the pickup sign. Passenger on the bus were yelling at the diver to stop for the elderly couple making their way from the shade 10’ away to the pickup point, to no avail, bus took off. Busses claim to pick you up every 30-40 minutes but frequently late. Audo on bus with headphones work less than half the time, and so much static you cannot understand the narrative. Don’t waste your money. Uber is your best option.",1
Hugely disappointing…avoid,"To get an initial feel and overview of a city, we’ve taken Hop on, Hop off tours in many cities including London, Paris (perhaps the best), Sam Francisco and Buenos Aries with great satisfaction. This was the worst because the audio was horrid and incomprehensible. Also, it was mostly Fado music with little background of the sights in comparison with others. Most difficult to find where we’re were as I could not download the route on the app; it continually reverted to Porto where I wasn’t instead of allowing access to Lisbon where I was. Sadly, I should have read the reviews more carefully and advised the hotel staff who recommended this of my disappointment.",1
Nao admira que tenham tantas más reviews,"Escolham condutores que realmente saibam conduzir. Nem sou cliente mas acabei de ter um motorista a parar na via em Algés para me explicar tudo o fiz errado, apesar de o mesmo ter: ignorado completamente uma cedência de passagem, seguindo de fazer a rotunda por fora, para a seguir parar ao meu lado (com passageiros a bordo) para me explicar que eu é que tou mal.

Há muito português por aí, não faz sentido terem motoristas que não sabem o que fazem",1
Terrible tour,"I got this tour years ago and was looking forward to using it to shoe family around the main sites during our cruise stop.
Actually thought someone had forgotten to turn on the commentary as we just had mournful favourite singing for 98%of the route. Really shocking to pay 25 euros for a bus with literally about 10 sentences of commentary in an 80 min route.",1
Bortkastede penger,"Totalt bortkastet. Bussene er gamle og nedslitte, og det er null hjelp. Velg bussene fra Lisbon sightseeing i stedet, dexer også røde, men er i rute og bussene er nye.",1
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEM!,"The worst city sightseeing bus I ever got. Almost no coments about the places, route change without any information, don't stop or wait in the bus stops, don't wait for customers go up/down the stairs, long wait in the stops, old buses. In short words, DONT BUY TICKETS FOR THIS COMPANY! GET ANY OTHER BUT THIS! THEY ARE DREADFUL!",1
Avoid this company,"This sightseeing bus is a total waste of money, we got on the bus at the Cruise terminal did a short tour & decided to get off & get on a later bus to continue, but we waited & waited & in the end just gave up, the streets of Lisbon are just so congested & to make matters worse there's another Red bus tour company operating ( Grey Line) so when you think your bus is coming it's the wrong company & they won't allow you on the bus!",1
A waste of time and mobet,We boarded a bus at the port at 10:50am and the bus moved off about 11:15. We meandered through streets but there was little or no commentary apart from the odd brief comment. We left the bus at 1:10 and we had not reached our boarding point. 2½ hours of my life I will never get back! Total waste of time and money,1
"NOT recommended. Just a ride, not a tour.","Information in the recordings were scarce, mostly Fado music. Lot of monuments, buildings and places where pass without any comments, but they include comments about shopping malls and repeated the same information many times. Buses are not very new.",1
Don't bother,"They never showed up! Nor did they try in anyway to contact us. When booking, it shows hotels to be picked up from but if yours isn't listed then you there is a box to put your hotel in. Still no show. If they cannot pick you up from your hotel, they need to let you know. Now I have the hassle to get a refund.",1
I was a very bad experience,"We never have been picked up at the Designated location. We Received the confirmation about pick up point and the time, No one showed up, Telephone did not answer. Half an hour laterwe received full refund on our trip, No apology or explanation provided!",1
The WORST!,"Terrible, never answered my messages! Never answered the phone, never picked us up even though it was “confirmed”. And had the audacity to send me a completed message, terrible, they wasted my time. Never book with them.",1
Shop Around,"The pros: communication prior to the tour was great. Pick-up time and place were confirmed and ticket times and prices were suggested and subsequently purchased from web links that were provided. Diego, our tour guide, was enthusiastic and had a great attitude.

The cons: pick-up was late and the vehicle was substandard for tourism. It was not clean, parts of the door seal were falling apart, and we could smell exhaust fumes in the cabin. I think this is his personal vehicle as there are no tourism markings on the vehicle. There was no water provided even though it was advertised. Our guide told us the palace tickets we were told to purchase by his colleague were not good for an efficient tour. Because of this, we weren’t able to see much of what the tour had to offer due to the ticket times and location… something you trust a tour company to consider.

I booked this through Chase experiences and couldn't be more disappointed. We've booked many tours through Chase experiences all over the world and this is by far the worst. It's like they started doing this tour right before he picked us up.

I want to be clear, this is not Diego’s company and as such, he said he had no choice in vehicle selection and he did not suggest tickets. However, there should be some quality control. Under no circumstances should anyone paying money be picked up in this vehicle nonetheless a tour company trying to make a first impression. We paid for a better vehicle experience considering we had to come out of pocket for everything else.

There were some fun parts… the two palaces and lunch were great, but unfortunately the beginning of the tour started out so negatively that it left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the day no matter how much Diego tried to salvage it. I'm so disappointed. Weigh my words carefully and choose wisely as there are many other choices.",1
I would not count on this company.,"Over the years I have had nothing but positives to say about the many tours I have booked through Viator…until today, The tour we booked started at 8h and the LisbonNative owner later confirmed that time.The night before the tour she moved the pickup time to an earlier. When i informed her that was not possible for us due to another commitment she was rigid and would not budge. There is no reason to do business with tour guides that will not stick to their contract and think so little of their client’s schedules.",2
Tour to forget,"Tour poor.luis can not speak Italian well, did not laugh not joke.
Every place we visited we had to correct because it gave us at most 10 minutes. Not recommended",1
"Nice Driver, Poor Time Arrangement","Overall the trip was below my average expectation. I give 2 star because the driver is nice, but the trip was poorly planned – when we went to Pena palace, the sun didn't even come out when we leave, making our photo dark and plain. The time we have at Roca Azenhas do Mar and Cabo da Roca is 15 min each, leaving really restricted time for photos. We had half an hour at Cascais, with nothing really interesting to do. When we get back, the sun is still high in the air.",2
A Trip Ruined by the Mad Self-centeredness of Guide,"I don't understand the positive reviews about this Sintra tour
with Guide A.Feldman... or our group met a double of his who imposed his off-topic ramblings. He never listened to our requests, he did what he wanted, he made us waste time intentionally, for the visit to the Pena palace, preventing us from lining up right away, to listen to his Infiniti sololoquies; he did not provide us with useful directions for the stop in Sintra and did not respect the scheduled times, stating that he generously gave us more time (but no one had asked for it), he always drove in a distracted and dangerous way, gesticulating, turning behind and taking his hands off the wheel to beat on the dashboard, screaming from the car and calling back the girls who passed; finally he offered us an endless sequence of clichés about Italians (probably the result of too many films) that could not be discussed... what can I say? our group of 8 people was patient hoping that so calmed down but it did not happen; we were happy to return safely given the way we drove... I strongly discourage this character who is really much beyond originality and extravagance ... I do not know how he can work with the public and even less understand the positive reviews I read and which I am sincerely amazed.",1
"Beautiful Sintra, Stressful experience","Sintra was beautiful and the Pena Palace was uniquely interesting. Other stops in the afternoon were nice. The pick-up was on time. The guide was knowledgeable. However, we felt that the day was quite rushed, not enough time for lunch and strolling around Sintra, and too little time for each stop. The tour guide’s driving habits were very hot-tempered with phone usage here and there while driving, which felt unsafe, along with lots of mean words about other drivers we needed to hear from him. The van size was small, too tight for 8 people. Overall, a good place to visit but not great experience unfortunately.",2
NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE,"GUIDE IN ITALIAN DOES NOT MEAN MULTILINGUAL GUIDE.
WE WANTED A GUIDE WHO DOES HIS JOB, NOT THE ENTERTAINER OF A HOLIDAY VILLAGE, WHO IS ALSO ARROGANT, LOUD TOO MUCH AND ANNOYING, EVEN THOUGH PERHAPS HE SEEMS TO BE NICE.
NOT EVEN AMERICANS LIKE SUCH ARROGANCE. LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM ON THE PART OF THE AGENCY. YOU PAY LESS AND YOU GET LESS.",1
High hopes - old car,"Lisbon was the last leg of our trip and we were so excited about this tour given the awesome reviews and destinations, not just Sintra, but around coastal viewpoints. We had high hopes. I knew something was up because when I booked my reservations we had prompt communication from the get go via What's App. We had booked tickets for Sintra separately for the 10AM slot as advised.

I expected confirmation of time and pick up point after the first day being in Lisbon. However, a day before our tour we still hadn't heard anything. I checked in with TripAdvisor or Viator (same same) to reach out to a rep. I even called them directly with no response. Finally, in the afternoon someone had reached out through What's App, the afternoon prior to our tour - to confirm everything.

We were expecting a van. As mentioned, a luxury ride with AC. We got none of that. It all made sense. The business vans were in the shop and the van we got was a renter, which I later learned when we were stranded. It was quite old and dinged on the side of the car. Our driver/tour guide seemed a little frazzled upon meeting. For one, he was doing multiple pick up point with a guest that didn't show and then I noticed the AC never turned on. Basically, it all made sense why they didn't reach out sooner to confirm pick up point. I think they took the time to figure out what plan B was. So we got a crappy van and our driver was headed out with 7 guests for better or for worst. Did I mention we had 2 small children with us. I felt bad for the folks in the back - it smelled of gas/fuse and hot as hell in the car.

The van eventually overheated. Luckily, we weren't stranded on the freeway. A yellow jacket landed on the interior window and freaked my kid out so he had to pull over for that reason and that's when we all knew, we weren't going to make it up there. We'd be lucky if this thing made it back into Lisbon. The thing that bothered us the most as customers was that they tried to push it. To keep the reservations, to have us ride this van, to see the trip through when our lives were literally put in danger. And Lisbon was going through a heat wave in the middle of June. It was over 100 degrees! Had he turned on the AC in the beginning of the ride that thing would have overheated right away.

They cancelled the booking, refunded us for the tour + tickets. It could have been avoided, the unpleasantness of it, by simply saying look I checked out this rental and it's not great.. we apologize we need to cancel. Like didn't someone at least QA this old van before you put people in for a long ride? Anyway, given the opportunity to go back, I would give this tour company a second chance. This time I'd definitely be making sure it's a nice and shiny black van with AC from this decade. Aside them pushing the agenda, I appreciate their quick service in refund. We still made the best of Lisbon.",2
"Sintra - on the day, a disappointment.","In Portugal, my wife and I spent 4 days exploring the highlights of Lisbon - an exhausting but fulfilling visit. Our trip was for 5 days, one day being reserved for Sintra, a visit we were really looking forward to.
Come the day, we boarded the train to Sintra - a truly unexceptional trip, and arrived at Sintra station, along with hundreds of other tourists. We took a taxi - a 'gull-winged vehicle ( a 'Delorean' springs to mind) and headed for Pena Place. When we arrived, the gates were closed and many hundreds of tourists milling around (more arriving by the minute). We were told that pena Place, and 4 other Palaces in Sintra, were closed for the day, because of a national planned strike by those who worked in the Palaces. At no point in time did anyone in Lisbon or Sintra make the tourists aware of the strike, and subsequent closure of the tourist attractions.
As such, I can only comment on Sintra. A truly unremarkable place, with little to offer visitors other than some highly-rated restaurants. To cap off an eventful day, through entirely my own fault (likely tinged with some level of frustration), I took the wrong train back to Lisbon, and ended up with a 40 euro taxi ride back to our hotel.",1
Poor Experience,"Al principio muy bien me contactaron para ponerse de acuerdo conmigo para el tour. Pero después todo fue perdiendo control:
El lugar en el que nos habían citado era diferente al que tenía el guía, así que llegamos tarde.
El guía muy descuidado al manejar, se metió en sentido contrario en una calle, cuando intentaba estacionarse golpeó el auto.
No pudo entrar con nosotros al palacio da
Pena porque le dieron un ticket con una hora diferente
Podía haber sugerido en Sintra hacer la visita a lugares interesantes como la quinta do regaleiro en vez de eso nos dijo dónde comer y caminar.
La cereza del pastel fue cuando se hizo en reversal le chocó al auto que venía atrás
Creo que pudo haber sido una mejor experiencia.",2
Prepare for Lisbon,"Couple tips:
1- Uber everywhere. It’s cheap, reliable and fast.
2- Praça do Comércio is a must. Go at night and enjoy the restaurants and great atmosphere. I recommend a place called Navega. Live music, beautiful people and affordable food.
3- if someone talks you into the TRAM 28, do not do it. It’s crowded, slow and pick pockets are all around.
4- There are a bunch of castles, monasteries, towers, etc. most of them require a ticket. Make sure to buy your ticket in advance. The lines are huge.
5- if you have time, go to Sintra and Cascais. Don’t hire a tour guide. It’s too expensive. You can UBER there or get a train. I recommend the Moorish castle in Sintra.
6- Have fun.",2
Ok tour with a good visit to Pena Palace and mediocre wine tasting,"This private tour took us to Pena Palace, which was amazing, to an old winery in Colares, where wine tasting was mediocre, to Cabo de la Roca, which was just a viewing point and to our opinion not worth it the visit. We also went to Cascais for lunch and our driver Gonzalo choose a very good restaurant. Cascais was nice. Gonzalo was a pleasant company and driver. We had booked this tour because of excellent reviews given to a guide called José. Unfortunately even after confirmation that José was going to be our guide, we were informed two hours before our tour on April 17th that he could not make due to some health issues. Communication with the tour provider was not as smooth as with other providers. They did not answer to messages via trip advisor and I had to contact them via WhatsApp. Even vía WhatsApp they answered with delay. Overall the tour was OK but taking into account the price and comparing to other private tours we are doing in Portugal it did not meet the expectations raised by previous reviews.",2
DO NOT BOOK HIM,"He took my pictures over a month ago. I was looking forward to reviewing them. It has been over a month. No photo, no response, viator is unable to get in touch with him. Honestly viator has been less than helpful.",1
Communication is Horrible/NO PHOTOS,"Ruben took our engagement photos, from what he showed us on his camera the pictures were beautiful. Ruben told us it would take 4 to 5 business days to receive the photos back. We have reached out multiple times to him and he has NOT responded back with an update on our photos. Even if the pictures were not ready yet, he could COMMUNICATE that with us. I feel like WE got SCAMMED and Robbed of a great moment.
I wanted to announce my engagement using those photos but we never received them. I feel like if you struggle with communication or you really don’t feel like doing this then STOP taking peoples money and WASTING THEIR TIME!

I WOULD NOT BOOK with HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!

PICK SOMEONE ELSE TO CAPTURE YOUR MOMENTS!",1
Terrible. Didn’t show up.,Didn’t show up. Wouldn’t answer texts or calls via Skype. Terrible waste of time and absolutely enraging.,1
The tour guide never show up and never answered his cell phone,"I made a reservation for today and the photographer ghosted me. I reached out via cell phone, found their Instagram, and emailed them, whats App. I did everything I could think of and I even waited there.

Trip Advisor needs to monitor this account because it's not a good look. You also don't know who you're dealing with, so this isn't good press for your business.

The customer service could use a HUGE upgrade. I requested my refund naturally so I am waiting to receive that.

It sucks when you're traveling and want to do something cool and then THIS happens. My reservation was at 7 am too and I woke up so early to get ready for this only to be met with crickets. It's 8 pm in Lisbon and I still haven't heard back from them.",1
HE DID NOT GIVE ME PHOTOS FOR 2 MONTHS,"He did not give me photos for 2months now and he just disappeared. I am worried that he is going to use my personal photos without my permission for any reasons. I was not comportable to shoot with him but he kept saying he is professional photographer, don't worry. but then when we were shooting photos, he fell down himself, he kept saying camera and memory card is broken but I was there it didn't break. he said he had to give his camera to canon service office then he said he is going to get back his camera soon then he got mad at me that happened with rude attitude. I wasted my time and money. he never replied ever since. I texted him happy christmas, happy new year. but he never gave me photos. He is using different name on the other website. he never gave me his info. this was totally scam. so disappointed. is he a photographer?",1
Portugal with Spainvision,"Travel NOT RECOMMENDED even for people with great Marian devotion who want to be in a hotel in Fatima every day. You have to have very good health and a lot of sacrifice spirit for the hundreds of km, the early mornings and the bad food.
But if you're looking for a cultural trip to what they announce ""the best of Portugal,"" I'll tell you it's a FRAUD. Since the hotel is in Fatima, you have to do hundreds of km every day to go to Coimbra, Porto, Lisbon, etc. cities that show you superficially from the bus, leave you a scarce free time that gives nothing and running back to the bus. In the two monasteries that led us with great history, no guide.
Road stops for driver rest in crowded places where we queued long lines to pee and didn’t have time to drink coffee.
I could say a lot more negative things.
Lack of total information such as that on the sixth day, only the night before tell us that the bus leaves for Madrid at 3 am. We arrived in Atocha 9 and a half hours later and then took the AVE each to its destination. Total one travel NIGHTMARE.",1
Transfer,"2
The driver was late so we had to call multiple times since it went to voice mail and finally ask help from a local. Then the van showed up with no sign and the driver just standing by vehicle. Finally my husband had to ask if he was here to pick up 4 people and then we were on our way late.",2
A total scam! Avoid !,"This card is a total SCAM!!! We are currently in Porto, we bought a Porto card (discount only) for 4 days, considering the places we wanted to visit. We arrived on Saturday and so far 2 of the museums we wanted to visit - and which were free with the Porto card - are currently closed! Anorher one (also free with the card) is also free every weekend. Yesterday we had lunch at Chez Lapin, which is supposed to offer a 10% discount. The man told us the discount coudn't work 1st because we didn't have a number on the card, 2nd because to get the discount we should have bought the card at their place... He was clearly inventing reasons. This is a total scandal!!! So far we have spent 18 euros each for almost nothing (-1€ for the cathedral and -3€ at the chamber of commerce)! The Porto card is a total fraud! I want my money back!!!",1
Expensive and useless,"Useless for those over 65, the offers are much better. No information on this subject on the site.. Money wasted; especially do not buy.",1
Not profitable,"To begin with, if you are over 65, there is no point in taking the Portocard.
“Senior” benefits are greater than those awarded by the Portocard.

The Porto card gives you free access to 6 attractions/monuments, including the cathedral which is not a paid monument. For the others, they were not on our to do list…
For other activities you will have 10 to 20%.
The porto card also allows you to benefit from discounts in food shops.
The only time I thought about taking out my porto card at a restaurant, the waitress took it from me to go do the bill, so I was happy to finally be able to recoup this investment! Then she came back and told me that the discount did not apply at lunchtime...maybe she said the opposite in the evening...

I also took the public transport option. You should know that the metro lines do not serve the historic center, so do not rely too much on it to organize your stay. You will need to rely on buses. There is no map with the routes of the different lines, you will have to use a Google map type application (not functional in Porto for Map ).
The advantage is that it is unlimited, so you can allow yourself to get lost or make stops in your journeys and thus discover places that you would not have planned.

In short, I didn't do the math but I probably didn't make my porto card profitable over a 4-day stay.",2
NOT FOR DISABLED PEOPLE WHO NEED FULL DOOR OPENING ACCESS TO ALIGHT FROM THEIR VEHICLE,"Intended to go to Polperro once more to see if the parking for disabled people was any better than last September when we found that disabled bays were exactly the same size as a normal car parking spot.Same as last year impractical to use one even if a space was available as it was impossible for me to get out. Coupled with the parking charges at £6 for 3 hours even if the owner of the land had Nationally recognised size parking bays which they have not ,(could class it as discriminatory) It would take me more than 3 hours to take in the views by foot and get back to the car. Personally it is not a disabled customer friendly car park and I would not recommend any disabled visitor to Polperro for this reason as pretty as it may be.",2
Igreja lindissima,"Igreja linda, porém o valor do ticket de entrada para olhar a igreja não compensa se comprado ao tamanho da igreja.",2
"Do not be fooled by the false niceness, Lisbon Soul Tours are unprofessional to the core","I booked Lisbon Soul Tours for a corporate event. At first she seemed helpful and professional however this is far from the case. First she quoted her price without IVA and then Lisbon Soul Tours thought it was appropiate to contact me on my personal number on a Sunday because she lacked the time management skills to manage her time and she thought it was appropiate to contact a customer out of office hours on a SUNDAY. She was doing her accounting and needed information from me. The lack of respect for my personal time was shocking and frankly I found it beyond rude that she thought contacting a customer on Sunday appropiate. Her response was "" its the only day I have to take care of it"". Her lack of time management skills is not my responsibily nor any other customers. Contacting out of office hours to discuss a non urgent work matter is beyond rude and outlines her complete lack of respect for her customers time. I was actually at a wedding trying to enjoy my day. I sent the basic information she requested, but she then continued to message me, expecting me to jump because she wanted me to jump. My messages were short because being reached out to on a Sunday is unprofessional and she is ruining my day. She then continued to expect me to answer her messages and I messaged her saying it was inappriopiate and rude to be contacting me on a SUNDAY and there is nothing tat cannot wait until Monday. SO SHE CANCELLED MY BOOKING. No apology because she was in the wrong, no undertstanding that I was at a wedding with my family and see was unsetting my day, no understanding that contacting a customer on a SUNDAY is out of order! NO IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER, she clearly thinks she is the most important person in the room. She is beyond unprofessional, do not fall for the fake niceness it is a front!",1
Reserve for experienced players,"An awfully hard golf course, to reserve for experienced players!!!! Very bad signage... lots of blind holes. To do absolutely by cart, because on foot it holds golf-hiking biathlon... very long links with high elevation, we thought we died 🤣
However, the greens, tees and fairways are correct.
What is certain is that we will not return to it.
Restaurant staff very friendly!!!!",2
Don’t waste your time and money on this “golf course”,This is the worst golf course in Portugal - poor layout and in absolutely appalling condition- the Belas course just next door has been completely renovated and is a much better course in infinitely better condition.,1
Management that sends messages to customers to delete comments made on different platforms,"Preparing for a wedding is not easy, whether big or small. For us, who had a relatively small wedding, less than 35 people, it was quite difficult to find a venue that accepted less than 50 guests.
After several disappointments, we found the Lisbon Club Restaurante, which offered us the possibility of holding a wedding with no minimum number of guests, with a perfect dinner space for our number of people and also an outdoor space where we held the civil ceremony.
Our wedding day was perfect, with ups and downs, but perfect due to the presence of everyone who was closest to us and who helped make the day more special.
Let's leave a small summary of our experience at Lisbon Club Restaurante.
For those looking for a place that does not require a minimum number of guests and in a location that offers privacy and an outdoor space surrounded by nature and at the same time looking for a place with good food and an affordable price, this could be the right choice .
We start by highlighting the positive aspects of choosing this space. The food was great, the menu we chose included starters, a fish dish, a meat dish and buffet desserts. All guests praised the food and also the fact that the option of another type of meat was provided for some of our guests who did not like the chosen dish. The table service was exceptional and, in our opinion, helped us relax from some of the lows that we will mention below. We also highlight Vanessa's exceptional service, without her the night would not have been the same. Not only for your empathy with people, but also for your animation and sincerity, thank you, Vanessa, who helped make our evening much more fun and made your presence known, several of our guests highlighted your good disposition and professionalism . Thanks.
We now move on to the negative aspects that are important to highlight, not only for those looking to hold a wedding in this space, but also so that management can take note and improve the service it provides for wedding events.
The Lisbon Club Restaurant is mainly used by members of the Golf club in which the restaurant is located. On the first visit we were informed that, since we wanted to hold the ceremony outside, it could only be held from 6:30 pm onwards, as until 6:00 pm all the indoor and outdoor space was for the use of regular customers.
Initially this small limitation did not cause us any constraint, as we managed to organize the civil ceremony to be held at 6:30 pm and the rest of the party was organized taking that time into account. However, as time went by, and in the various interactions we had with the people responsible for the restaurant, we noticed that the biggest focus was always on regular customers and not on the event we were planning.
The limited timetables ended up becoming the biggest problem in holding the wedding in this space and, in our opinion, what the management should change if they want to capture a larger audience of couples looking for spaces for smaller weddings.
Having the ceremony time imposed on us at 6:30 pm wouldn't have been a problem, if it weren't for the fact that, as time passed, they made us feel as if we were extra in space and wanted to “dispatch” the matter quickly.
To give some context and as we mentioned before, our wedding had less than 35 people. Furthermore, we decided not to spend money on the extra services that the restaurant also offers, such as dining room decoration and exterior decoration, nor on DJ entertainment. Taking this into account, we ourselves tried to create some simple decorations for the dining room and the ceremony space.
It was during the week before the wedding that we noticed the biggest lack of interest and concern on the part of the restaurant.
In the various conversations we had with the management, we had organized and agreed everything we wanted to do for the decoration that we delivered to be placed in the dining room and ceremony space, as well as time to set up the sound system that we would use at the event. .
This is where the “time” factor, or lack thereof, becomes a problem.
We had been given permission to leave the columns prepared and assembled in the dining room the day before the wedding. However, when we arrived the day before the wedding to deal with this situation, the employees seemed to have no information about this matter that we had already discussed with the management, and we ended up making a vain trip to the space, as after all the speakers were not they could be left assembled in the space as they would “interfere” with the club members’ lunch.
When we asked what time on the wedding day we could have things ready, we were told only from 6pm (note that the ceremony was scheduled for 6:30pm). Before that we couldn't, as golf club members have all the indoor and outdoor space. Also highlighting that we were informed that all these people were informed that from 6pm the spaces were being used for a private event, however during the ceremony and photo session on the golf course, there were still customers outside our event circulating.
The limited time to organize the event, without hiring extra services from the restaurant, became worse when, on the wedding day, the groom arrives at 6:10 pm at the ceremony space to set up the columns outside, and what he finds is a space for half-mounted ceremony.
The petals had been placed on the floor to create the hallway, as we had requested, but in the middle was a tennis table that is usually there for regular customers. There were no chairs for the guests, there was a rubbish bin next to the ceremony table and next to the bar area, there was another rubbish bin and a “Hello” ice cream sign. The table we had requested to place the columns was also missing, as well as the only decorative piece for the ceremony table.
We paid €190 to be able to hold the civil ceremony outside. A value that had not been mentioned on the first visit to the space, however we accepted it, as the value supposedly included the preparation and assembly of the space's decoration. Highlighting that our decoration was minimal, just a small aisle of petals and a decorative piece for the ceremony table.
For those who pay €190 to rent the space, we expected it to be clean and tidy, as we had been promised they would do from 4pm on the day of the wedding. What happened was that the cleaning and organization of the space was only done after the groom's arrival and with guests present, within 20 minutes, when it was discovered that things had not been done as we had previously agreed and organized with the management.
This reminder is so that you can improve your service if you really want to have more success and more wedding events. We understand that you already have your regular customer base, but, if you commit to holding these events, the least you should pay attention to is your customers, whether they want to do more elaborate or simpler things. Everyone has the right to your dedication and concern.
Contrary to what we have seen mentioned in previous comments on this platform about the ceremony space, perhaps if we had hired the extra decoration service, we would not have had all these limitations and stressful moments.
Our wedding day was perfect, we had fun and it will forever be unforgettable, however we couldn't help but share our experience in this space so that future couples know and also so that management takes note and seeks to improve the service for this type of events.

Update on 19/10/23 - The text written above was initially published on the Casamentos.pt platform, and right then we received a message from Mrs. Ana (management) shamelessly asking us to modify the score and the comment we made about the service they provided us, something unbelievable and completely unacceptable. 2 days ago, our comment was deleted from this platform, apparently at the request of the restaurant. If the revolt over the lack of professionalism was already great before, it has become worse. Don't trust this company for your wedding.",1
Inaccurate and false,I had to cancel a pickup and custom tour due to American Airlines’ performance. I learned of the flight cancellation and notified my driver well in advance. I also notified the Welcome customer service team and sent all documents verifying issues outside my control. I asked for a refund. The rep reviewed the ask and declined saying they sent to the driver anyway and paid him and that I missed my flight. Both inaccurate and false. They have all evidence to the contrary. I don’t cancel due to whim or a changed mind. I don’t even get to Lisbon due to airline problems. Don’t punish the customer who acted in good faith. I wouldn’t use this company.,1
Never use Welcome Pickups,"We scheduled a transfer with Welcome Pickups from our Lisbon hotel to the airport. I received an email that our driver was there at our hotel waiting for us. He wasn’t. Then I received a text from the driver asking us to meet him “in front of the sardine store on main square.” We had NO IDEA where that was. The square near the hotel was Rossio Square, which is the largest square in Lisbon - many, many football fields could fit into it. We asked directions to the “sardine store” but by the time we got there, which was less then 20 minutes from our original pickup time, we got an email saying the transfer was canceled and no refund was possible because the driver could not find us! We had to grab a cab and race to the airport for our flight! A very tense and frustrating experience!",1
Dont take the EXPENSIVE transfer. Go with uber or bolt,"So expensive transfer and when u cancel after 24hours u dont have any refund. When the person cancel it is NOT explicity or even show up any msg warning. I paid with my internacional card that has been added fees. Terrible company. I tried to contact to have my money back, but without any success",1
Out $64 and feeling used,"My friends and I booked Welcome Pickups to take us from the Lisbon airport to our AirBnB. As we were first time overseas travellers we had no previous information on how long it would take to get through customs. I booked the pick up for what I thought would be sufficient time to get through customs and pick up our luggage. I also provided my flight number so the driver would know if there were delays with my arrival. Going through customs ended up taking almost 2 hours because of the incredibly long lineup. By that time our drive had left and we were out the $64 paid in advance. When I inquired about a refund, I was denied. While I understand that the company cannot wait indefinitely, there was nothing on the website when I booked the drive giving us any indication of how long we should expect to wait to get through customs. If they had done this, as a first time traveller I would have booked the pick up for a later time. This was very disappointing as I feel that the company does not care about their customers enough to give them all the information needed to successfully book a pick up. I will not use their service again and would recommend others instead use Uber as we ended up doing, for a lower price.",1
"2 trips, 2 complete failures","I booked this service for a pickup at the Lisbon airport, as well as a trip from our AirBnB to the airport. In both cases, the drivers canceled. Luckily Uber was available.

Full details: prior to my arrival in Lisbon, I had booked a transfer for 5 people with 5 bags. The day before the driver texted me and said that he did not think that his car (which the service reserved for me) would work. He offered to upgrade my car at a 50% increase in cost (or 3x what an Uber cost). I declined and asked them to cancel and refund my money. I did get a message that my cancelation did not merit a refund since it was within 24 hours, which I found humorous since their service caused the problem.

Similarly, on my return to the airport the driver thought the car was too small. I asked to cancel and refund, which they did. Then the drive said he misunderstood the number of bags and said he could take us. I tried to book again and after waiting 5 hours for a response they canceled. Luckily Uber
allowed me to prebook a car.

I will not use this service again.",1
NO SHOW and VERY unsatisfying reaction,"Prepaid transfer that never happened, they claimed the driver was there till 20:52 - we could proof (with screenshots) that we tried to call the driver (who was NOT there) from 20:50 onwards - after we already looked for him 10 minutes - so clearly a lie........there was NO DRIVER and NO RESPONSE to our calls - we were left alone at the airport AFTER THE trip was paid already - now we need a lawyer to get our money back - leave alone the trouble and inconvenience..... BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE - STAY AWAY from (un)welcome tours in Porto at least....",1
A Scam. Don't be fooled.,"Terrible experience with Welcome Pickups Lisbon. They are not legit. A total scam. They took my money without giving me the ride I requested. I paid over 200 dollars in advance, and even though they never gave me the ride, they refused to return it. Don't make the mistake I did. Don't trust them with your money.",1
No Driver showed,"NEVER, NEVER, NEVER USE THIS COMPANY! We booked a transfer from the Lisbon airport to our hotel. No driver came to pick us up and when we called we were given the run around. They suggested that we just not go ahead with the booking that we already paid for. I demanded a refund and will hope and pray that I ever see it. NEVER NEVER NEVER!",1
Unprofessional,"Organized a couple of days way in advance, and she cancelled on us. Yes, there were changes in our itinerary and number of days engaged, but to tell us another client got priority over us??? Very unprofessional and her dropping us has left us in a lurch during busy season.",1
Terrible itinerary,"While the places we visited were all amazing we were very disappointed overall. The highlight of this day trip, and the reason we booked it, was to see Sintra. We left downtown Lisbon at 8:15 am and got to Sintra at 5:30 pm after spending most of the day riding in a van to and from the other destinations. By the time we got there we were all exhausted. I can not recommend this itinerary.",2
Not very good experience,Very amateur approach of guiding. Unfortunately we didn’t listen anything of what the guide explained. We were without headphones and the guide took us to the city and the train station which were too crowded for him to be heard. He blamed our group for making noise but they lactually lack professionalism. When we comment and complained that it wasn’t feasible for us to follow and listen he again blamed us. As soon as we realised that we wouldn’t be able to listen to him we gave up and just wandered around the city. Don’t hire this company unless you demand headphones!!!,1
Horrible Driving Experience / Severe Anxiety All Day / Driver Nodding Off,"The entire day, we were terrified since driver was swerving, nodding off, and driving recklessly. We almost got off the tour until we realized we were over 2 hours from Lisbon. Expecting a full refund due to the anxiety and feeling scared.
This driver should not have a license!",1
"Fatima, Nazare and Pena Palace tour that I would Not recommend!","I am very disappointed in our tour. I did the research and thought that this would be an ideal tour. It was not! The group was small , 8 customers, 2 were Brazilian and the rest English speaking. We were put in a van that had 3 adults sitting in the back bench. It was very hot and cramped. I asked if the air could be cooler and was told no. The different areas of the tour were a distance apart from each other, which I knew. But in so many tours that I have taken, there is a consistent interaction and provision of info about the region, culture, etc. There were none of that during the ride to the location. I’m talking 90 minutes of nothing. It was only when we were either at the location or driving into the area that we got a little info. The guide had to translate into Portuguese then into English and drive. His English was not the best and you could tell that he was more comfortable engaging with the Brazilian couple. Once we got to Nazaré and Fatima, we were left to wander on our own. The Pena palace the guide did accompany us and gave some details. This was not an ideal tour. I definitely would Not recommend this tour.",2
Rare,"We arrived late to Sintra, from there straight to eat in Nazare where we lost an hour and a half alone in the lunch spot, from there 10 min to see the main Attraction, we did not know the center, we arrived super late to Fatima, we were given less than 50 min to tour without any explanation and no time to buy presents, everything was very weird. I would not repeat and regret taking the tour.",1
Wild and scary ride.,"Tour guide was very nice but his driving was erratic on the gas and brake pedal. He drifted in and out of lanes, was speeding and easily distracted. It was scary and all 7 passengers that were not in the same party were concerned. He tried to be very informative but was hard to understand. We were all happy to be out of the van at the end of the day.",1
Não indico! Péssimo serviço. Desrespeitoso.,"conheci a living tours em dois passeios que fiz saindo do Porto. Em Lisboa, decidi marcar um passeio para Sintra com a mesma empresa porque tinha tido boa experiência. Marquei na véspera, portanto entrei em contato via chat e whatsapp para garantir que havia vagas e estava tudo certo. Fechei o pacote, paguei na hora via cartão de crédito. Chego na manhã seguinte ao local marcado com 10 minutos de antecedência e não havia ninguém caracterizado com a marca da living tours, nenhuma indicação. Havia guias da buendia, meu pai abordou um que buscou nosso nome numa lista, não encontrou e disse de maneira grosseira que não era com eles. Alguns minutos depois, abordamos outro guia da buendia que disse (de maneira simpática) que deveríamos esperar o guia da living tours. O grupo grande sai e ficamos meu pai, minha mãe e eu na praça. Ninguém da living tours. Tento contato via whatsapp mas era sábado às 8h30 e só respondem a partir de 9h. De imediato, jogam o erro em mim: sugerem que havia sido informafo por email que o passeio era da buendia e que a responsabilidade era minha. Observação: no email não fica explicado explicitamente que o passeio seria realizado por outra empresa; apenas passam o contato da buendia. Se eu chego ao local e o guia da outra empresa diz que não é com eles, o que deveria fazer? Uma hora no whatsapp... Resolvo ir até o escritório e a agente bem simpática. Aí descobrimos que a buendia cometeu um erro e não incluiu nossos nomes na lista. Destalhe: em nenhum momento a living tours assumiu qualquer erro; jogou a culpa para mim e jogou a culpa para a empresa terceirizada, mas nunca foi dela mesma ou de seus funcionários. A agente tentou encontrar maneiras de compensar, mas olha o absurdo: depois de falar com a supervisora, nos ofereceu um passeio privado para ver um castelo de Sintra (nós tínhamos fechado um passeio para ver dois) e devolveria a diferença; mas não fez nenhum desconto teríamos que pagar o valor integral do passeio. Não houve nenhuma cortesia, nenhum pedido de desculpa prático. Eu acabaria tendo que contratar um serviço particular, privado (que é mais caro!!!) e ainda ver apenas metade do que eu desejava ver. Basicamente, eu estava sendo punido por um erro que não era meu. Foram duas horas de enorme chateação e nenhuma mea culpa da living tours. A proatividade foi para substituir o passeio mas não deram nenhum jeito de garantir o passeio que eu tinha contratado. No fim das contas, para não perder o dia com meus pais já idosos, aceitamos um terceiro passeio a Sintra para ver um palácio histórico (mas não era o da Pena nem a Quinta da Regaleira como eu queria). E tive que me contentar. Essa experiência foi terrível, com a culpa sendo jogada de um lado para o outro, inclusive para o cliente, e ninguém corrigiu mesmo a situação para garantir os passeios que nós desejávamos. Ou seja: no fim das contas foo só por dinheiro, não para garantir uma boa experiência para nós. Registre-se: a living tours não opera em Lisboa, mas terceiriza os serviços. Assim sendo, não garante a boa qualidade. Na hora do problema, todos têm responsabilidade menos a empresa.
A bem da justiça: a colega que nos atendeu no guichê de turismo em Lisboa (em nome da living tours) foi prestativa e acredito que tenha feito o melhor que pôde. A guia Catarina e o motorista (de óculos) que nos levaram a Sintra e Cascais também foram competentes. Mas isso não apagou em nada a enorme chateação de mais cedo. Foi meu último dia em Portugal e a lembrança que trouxe foo de desrespeito e frustração.",1
Dogs not allowed,No dogs allowed. No reason whatsoever since it's a book shop... Just told me my dog couldn't enter. Does not fit with the whole LxFactory concept,1
Cancelled hours before,"The man messaged me a few days before introducing himself and I replied saying how excited we were. He then asked us if we could book through him as tripadvisor takes too much commission. I would have but we had already purchased our tickets. He then didn’t respond for two days, and then the evening before (less than 12 hours before our booking) he cancelled it through the booking website and did not message to say he was going to do that. The money takes 3-5 days to return into the account so we couldn’t book with anyone else. It was disappointing as our kids were looking forward to a tuk tuk ride and I felt let down as he cancelled it without consulting me. I do not recommend this company as I don’t want anyone else to be disappointed by their unreliability.",1
Beautiful but terrible ending,5 women took this tour from Lisbon. Driver was 20 minutes late picking us up and then had to stop at the store to pick up the water that was “included”. It was advertised as a “luxury” car and it was anything but luxury. Very uncomfortable and could hear nothing in the back seat. Our driver Vincent was very polite and tried his best to get the car very close to our destinations. Sadly we had a terrible car accident on the way home. Vincent called another car to take us the rest of the way back to Lisbon. We tried to get the tour company to pay for our medical supplies (bandages ice packs etc) and the lost night in Lisbon but no success. Thankfully we were not seriously hurt but bruised and shaken up. This company did not care. I would not recommend them because of their lack of concern and lack of compensation.,1
Tuktuk Lisbon,"Be very careful with these. Know the cost up front. If you need a ride from one place to another, stay away from the tuktuk. Other options are cheaper like the hop on hop off and a lot more flexible for site seeing. It’s not worth the money!",1
Waste of time,"Booked a tour. Travelled an hour to get to the meeting place, got there, just for them to cancel the tour 30 minutes before. Unprofessional.",1
Ride to hell.,"Try getting a modern Tuk Tuk with decent suspension. Five to ten minutes into my tour I was jolted in my seat by the vehicle running over a very deep pothole in the road which lifted me out of my seat, I hit my head on the shoddy canopy (which was already ripped and frequently tended to by the guide) and hurt my back triggering a sciatica attack and my Parkinson’s. Hoping this to be a one off incident, I continued with my journey. Little did I realise the incident will be repeated in lesser form throughout the trip. I could not concentrate on the guide’s dialogue because of the intermittent attacks of pain on my left, I could not take decent photos due to the right hand side was shaking because of Parkinson’s.
I had warned the tour operator that I had Parkinson’s and they assured me they had assigned a vehicle with easy access for the trip. Access was not easy. I did not see an appreciable difference between this Tuk Tuk and the other, younger, better maintained vehicles. Thankfully, I returned to my comfortable hotel to rest my back for the rest of the day after forfeiting the last hour of my trip due to pain.
The vehicle I was in was a disgrace. It was not fit for purpose. The “suspension” was useless, if the vehicle had any, and the bodywork is showing very many signs of wear.
It needs scrapping, and the parts recycled.
To get to the meeting point and to return to the hotel I took an Uber. Why is it that a well maintained car can drive over the potholes without being a problem to the passengers, whereas the Tuk Tuk cost me ten times the cost of one Uber ride? Are you charging extra for the discomfort?
I have given the trip one star, as “no stars” is not an option.",1
Ottimo prodotto prezzo truffa,"Bellissimo negozio dove vemdono scatolette di Tonno, Sardine, sgombri ecc ecc.

Extremely Disappointed – Look4Portugal Failed to Deliver on Every Level,"My friends and I booked Exoticca’s Portugal & Spain escorted tour as a special birthday trip, expecting a guided cultural experience as advertised. What we received was a disorganized, unsupported experience — largely due to the failures of Exoticca’s local partner, Look4Portugal (L4P).

From the outset, no tour guide was ever assigned to our group. This was sold as an escorted tour, yet we were left solely with a driver — who was kind, professional, and did his best, but not trained or informed to act as a tour guide. There was no commentary, no structured itinerary, and no on-the-ground support. We were simply dropped off at sites with no context or explanation.

After we raised concerns, Look4Portugal misled Exoticca by claiming a guide had been provided — referring to our driver. This was a clear misrepresentation. A driver is not a substitute for a licensed guide. We later learned that L4P had intentionally chosen not to assign a guide due to our group being small — a decision that was never disclosed to us and completely undermined the product we paid for. Even worse, they fired the driver, who was not at fault and did his best under the circumstances. This felt incredibly unfair and deflective of real accountability.

We also tried to contact Look4Portugal multiple times using the WhatsApp and phone number provided in our welcome documents — no one ever responded. We had zero local support, no daily communication, and no way to confirm what was happening with the itinerary or excursions.

One of the biggest disappointments was being denied entry to the Alhambra in Granada — a major tour highlight — because tickets were never secured in advance. Instead, we were walked around the exterior gardens and missed the full experience completely.

Each day began with stress and confusion, as we had no idea what the schedule was or what to expect. Optional excursions were never offered, and we missed out on experiences we would have gladly booked had they been presented.

In summary:

Look4Portugal failed to deliver the guided experience promised.

They misled Exoticca during the follow-up investigation.

They offered no local communication or support.

And they fired the only person who showed up — our driver — who was not at fault.

If you're considering a tour with Exoticca, and Look4Portugal is listed as the local operator, please reconsider. This provider takes no accountability, misrepresents facts, and left us with a trip that did not match what we paid for or were promised.",1
Nuno the Negative,"Our Portugal trip was from 3/26/2024 to 4/3/2024 through Exoticca travel company headquartered in Spain. Exoticca has a tie up with a local travel agency in Portugal called Look4Portugal through whom we were assigned a tour guide called Nuno. Nuno is okay with young & able bodied tourists. But he has a long way to go to understand how to be sensitive & caring to people of color & specially to senior tourists in his group. We did not not have the best experience with him. He always sat at the front of the bus with his favorite people of the group who were white people. He would rarely come to the back of the bus where we were seated. Also, due to heavy rain during our Portugal visit we got separated from our group members on the very first day. We could not find the group since Nuno never gave anyone a meeting point & a fixed time to meet at that meeting point. He certainly did not share any number to call him in times of need or emergency. Not able to locate guide Nuno, our group folks, the tourist bus, & not able to reach a Look4Portugal staff on the phone, we took a taxi paying 25 Euros (which was certainly not refunded) to get back to the hotel in the middle of heavy rain to be safe in an unknown place as first time visitors. Called Look4Portugal again from our hotel's front desk for the second time again. This time we got to talk to Eric who sounded that it was all our fault. He suggested that we take a taxi again to meet the group at a different location, all in the middle of heavy rain in a new country as a first time female visitors (my senior mother & me). Only when I said that I will officially complain to Exoticca since he does not care about courtesy & goodwill, he came to the hotel to pick us up to take us back to the rest of the group. There was another tourist bus also who had Exoticca passengers. I checked with some of the tourists in that group as we were all staying in the same hotel. They said that their tour guide, Andre was very efficient & rescheduled the itinerary unlike Nuno to avoid the heavy rains to be flexible & accommodative. The white people tipped Nuno because they left some of their belongings in the hotel & Nuno took all of us back to get those items. I am 200% sure that he would not do this for his non-white group members like us. Without rain & Nuno, this can be a good trip.",1
The worst travel company ever!,"This is an awful company to travel with. My husband had a heart attack on our flight to Portugal and was taken directly to Santa Maria Hospital in Lisbon. I called the 24/7 help line and they did NOTHING to assist us. We were alone, with a medical emergency, did not speak the language and the company did absolutely NOTHING to assist us. When I explained the situation to our tour guide the next day, she was unhelpful and could have cared less. After he was released I asked Exoticca for assistance getting us flights home, they wanted to charge us each $5000 for one way flights. Stay very far away. It maybe inexpensive to travel with them, but you get less than you paid for.",1
Look4Portugal is your enemy,Look4Portugal has been the worst host/guest service we have encountered in 25 years of international travel. Exoticca travel uses them in Portugal as an outsource provider. Multiple times on our anniversary trip they failed us. Very simple tasks such as changing our ride pickup time to the airport and giving us the phone number of our guide. Honestly it seems they are trained to provide obstacles and excuses rather than finding simple solutions. We got so frustrated that we just paid the $10 Uber to the airport than deal with these enemies.,1
Bad experience is an understatement. Don't go to this place.,"Horrible! My friend suffered prejudice at the hands of the two security guards. One of them disoriented. For me, none of my friends who have been to the lounge ever go back there. There are several complaints about security. Someone will have to take some action. There are videos of the security guard pushing my friend.",1
"Oh, bad.","Oh, bad. Both environment, food and above all reception staff. Always overcrowded and all attending badly",1
On the low end but does have a shower for extra €,"Not the worst lounge, but definitely on the lower end. Lots of seating with random charging outlets for European plugs, USB, and USB-C. Plenty of beverages. Sparse food. And the thing that costs additional money is the shower. Its an additional 16.5 euro charge for using the shower. The shower is pretty limited. No ventilation. No towel to stand on after the shower. Just one bath towel and a shower that has only hot or cold water. No warm water. One additional thing to keep in mind, if you are traveling internationally, is you still have to go through passport control after the lounge and that can take 30 to 45 minutes. That is crowded and hot and makes using the shower pointless.",2
Worst Lounge of all time !,"Congratulations ANA Lounge at T1 Lisbon airport for winning my award of ""Worst Airport Lounge of all Time "". I mean you have to go someway to beat some lounges in Asia and Africa but you really are the worst. From the warm white wines to the only food at 5pm being breakfast items, to the stale rolls, to the lack of USB ports, to the dirty tables left while cleaning staff stand and chat loudly, and who can forget the 'couldn't give a damn"" reception staff. What a complete and utter garbage operation ! You let down your country !",1
Avoid at all costs,"I travel a lot and pay for Admiral's club access, which they claim to be a partner. The woman at the entrance (Silva Portway) is perhaps the rudest lounge entrance worker I've ever encountered. She denied me access, even though I clearly have a flight with American Airlines. She was mad that the ticket said they plane was operated by Aer Lingus (I mean, come on...)

I was completely professional, and she threatened to call the police on me. I don't know what she'd tell them?

Just don't go here.",1
"crowded, but charged access can, priority pass not!","I felt disrespected, I tried to access with my priority pass, and I was informed that at that time due to the super crowd it would not be possible to enter, but if I could, I could also enter by paying.
Hence comes the question, if it was crowded, how would paying that scenario change?
I found it disrespectful and immoral.
This happened two 27.05.25 around the 14hrs.",2
Terrible airport lounge,British Airways club class invite you to the delights of this airport lounge. There are no words to describe how awful it is.,1
Breakfast at 5pm,"Totally unreal lounge experience…
Arrived at 5pm to be met with breakfast foods still out for consumption as well as a small selection of rolls…… that was it….. no hot food, no salads, nothing.

The tables are filthy, the toilets are so dark it’s unbelievable…

If you get free access, eat in the food court and then use the lounge for somewhere relatively quiet.

If you’re paying, don’t…. Waste of money",1
Worst VIP room I've been to in Europe,"Poor VIP room. Few foods and drinks, placed anyway and takes time to be repaired. White wines and roses served at room temperature without being frozen. Delay in cleaning in dirty places.
The space is very large, but poorly prepared on the question of drinks and food",1
Rude front desk staff - shocked,"Terrible experience, we had access to the lounge and were worried by the tone and attitude of the ladies at the front desk. Most notably the south Asian lady who called my partner and I a donkey in Portuguese and foolishly thought we don’t speak the language. This is a sackable offence and management should act.",1
Extremely bad,"What a shame...
Atmosphere was horrific, no music, agent / employees were all antipathetic...
Crowded, nothing hot to eat....A place to avoid absolutely...",1
Not great,Food was scarce and nothing special. Overall pretty small and happened to be very busy. Seating was fine but there were few spaces with privacy as they’re all displayed in a row. A couple families with babies and toddlers who were unfortunately fuzzy and made it noisy. Coffee was from a machine so it was pretty medium.,2
Catastrophic and often complete. Even if it is sometimes emptier than other times.,"Toilet: At first glance not bad but toilet paper is rarely seen. Ridiculous.
Tacos or other dishes that serve hot are served cold.
Access is sometimes at the head of the client.
3 or 4 people arrive with an access card. We let them in.
Besides, it should stop offering 2 accesses for a card.
And this lounge was finished to be renovated in 2024,
That being said, it is the entire airport that is a disaster with leaders who clearly never use passenger access.
Few jobs where Portuguese staff seem highly motivated even if there are good exceptions.
Vinci doesn't know how to run this airport.
Bus drivers who pick up passengers at the cut-off wait for the 3 buses to be full before leaving for the terminal. Result, expectations, expectations, expectations! It’s grossly lame.
One of the worst airports in the world. So lounges are necessarily the reflection of the whole.",1
A one star review is a stretch,"Don’t even bother! And for those of you thinking perhaps life is grand in a private lounge, think again. This is no better than staying in the main terminal. No seats available, overcrowding, no thought to design and food quality subpar. An overcrowded hot mess. Shame on you ANA!",1
Serious capacity issues - avoid,"Has major capacity issues, packed and turning people away (including people who had purchased access). Do not purchase access if you have an afternoon flight, they still refuse access between to 2 and 4 pm. When you get in it’s very mediocre.",1
Access denied,"VIP room that accepts lounge, priority and dragon cards... But every time in the last two Trips the access was impossible due to the crowding of the room
. Give preference to the passengers of the executive.. conclusion if you have a card in these programs the airport of Lisbon you get without a VIP room most of the times.. I have used the room really it is suitable but in the last two Trips I could not enter",2
Please avoid it...,"I left Lisbon 37 years ago but often visit my family.
I saw these lounge declining in quality over the years but recently heard of the refurbishment so I was quite excited to revisit it to find out that is gone from bad to worst to say the least.
The welcome is just not there.
The quality of the food has to be the worst I have seen in years from tinned fruit salad to incredibly cheap pasteis de nata, also the drinks are so basic that not even the cheapest hotel would feature them on their mini bar.
Don't try to use the WC as I tried four times over a period of two hours and they never been cleaned.
It has to be the worst airport lounge in the world and trust me I visited over thirty, even some in Africa would be better...
Just a small message to the operator being it...""Don't be so greedy, because you can't take it with you""
What a terrible place!!!",1
O pior Lounge da Europa.,"Em termos de espaço e mobiliário está ok. Para já na parte importante bebidas e comida. Péssima !! Há cereais do mais barato e ruim, lanches frios e mal elaborados, pastelaria que dá arrepios e afronta a iguaria Lusitana ,pastel de natas, que oferecem. Os cafés de máquina devem ser de grãos de arrastão, muito ruins. Enfim.uma fss piores salas da Europa que acaba por combinar com o aeroporto, o pior da Europa.",1
Dirty and incapable of providing a cup of coffee,"This lounge is staffed by people who don’t even try. They walk around like zombies collecting the dirties.

The coffee is via two machines which are poorly labelled. Only one machine has a milk option. When I tried it water came out because it was out of powder. After it was refilled I got a whole cup of milk. I then had to start pouring the milk into another cup of coffee. There are no stirrers so I had to use a knife! Dreadful experience.

The lounge is dirty and the toilets stink.",1
Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever. First you are told that you’re too early because your card allows only for a certain amount of time. I can understand this. Later you come again and they just deny your access (Priority Pass), because they can. They don’t need any reason. We have visited this lounge earlier (pre Covid) without any problems. It seems that nothing stays the same. Very rude and poor customer service. Probably will take my money somewhere else the next time.",1
Rudely rejected… 2x within 4 weeks,"I was turned away twice within 4 weeks despite having a valid access card.

The Ana Lounge ""LISBON"" is unfortunately not a representative example of hospitable Portugal. It's just sad how miserably bad the quality of the staff at the entrance has become.

I was turned away twice already despite having paid for access. After I asked and pointed out that there were a lot of tables and seats free, I was rudely asked to leave and complain to my access provider.

Just pathetic and sad",1
"Dull, depressing & truly awful.","The most depressing lounge in the worlds worst airport, truly dreadful place. Queues outside for 20 minutes to then try and find seats for 2 people in a dark depressing soulless room. Food and drink choices are comedy gold bad. AVOID",1

avoid as much as possible,"although a large space, we have few food options, always crowded and impolite service. dirty bathrooms. To become a differentiated space, where you pay for it, there is a lot to modify. In summary: there is no reason to praise",1
Busy and very dark!,"This actually met expectations as we’d read the reviews before visiting! We concur with other reviewers that this is a far from a relaxing experience. At 11.00 on a Tuesday, the lounge was crowded necessitating a 10-15minute wait to get in. Once in, it was a game to spot the free seats!
There is one bench for cold food (sandwiches) and a bar area for spirits and pastries de nata which had to be requested from the barman! There are 2 stations for drinks but no local beer! My other half thinks a hot meal can be ordered from the barman but I saw no one do this.
A large part of the lounge is very dark resembling a night club.
On the positive side some of the sandwiches were tasty (serrano ham and cheeseveggie, pesto option). There are toilets and showers ( latter not used). Staff are prompt at removing used crockery/ cutlery. Plenty of alcogel stations too for the infection aware.
Its not our worse experience ( Gatwick South and Seville) but lots to improve on.",2
"Avoid. Too crowded, not relaxing. Average food.","Avoid this lounge and stay in the main concourse where there is more comfortable seating, better food, fewer crowds. The staff working hard to keep it clean but it’s way to small for the number of people pushing to get in.",1
Absolutely awful!,Waited 25 minutes to get into lounge as shared with 28 other airlines. Once inside it was dirty and extremely tatty. Food was substandard with just a small selection of filled bread rolls and a small bowl of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm. Constant queuing for a drink whether that be a tea/coffee or alcohol beverage. Soft drinks and beer in the fridge was warm. This is not what I expect when flying Business class. This has to be the worst lounge I have ever used.,1
NO good,"We booked this VIP transfer through booking.com. The driver arrived 36 minuttes after arrival.

We arrived at 10:52 and got a text, that the driver was waiting for us, holding a sign with our name. 11:01 we started looking for the driver. He was not there!!!

11:11 the driver texted us, asking us to go to a place outside. We go there, but still no driver. We then phoned the driver asking where to find him. He arrived at 11:28.

After a few days we had to go to the airport again. We asked LR Portugal Tours to be picked up at 8:20. The driver came 10 minutes early, NO SMILING, and a bad attitude - and he was angry, that we couldn't drive right away.

We were ready at 8:20 and started driving 5 minuttes later 8;25. The driver Refused to talk to us during the whole trip. After days with the friendly portuguese people, this was a bad experience.

There are many taxis in Lisbon. NO waiting. All drivers are friendly - and a trip to - or from - the airport costs approximately 12 euros. Price for a trip with LR Portugal Tours is 30 euros.",1
"Were hopeful, but went through a miscommunication from them, not through unfortunately.","I gave it 2 stars, because it didn't happen. We were waiting for the spot, but nobody came. One friendly man from the hotel, where you had to wait, helped us with calling, to the tour operator. The Guide was unable to do the tour and had indicated this to the organization.

Bad ballad!,"Bad experience on that ballad. Security has been extremely poorly educated from the start. Me and my friends were on the list with guaranteed admission until 1:30, and when we arrived, we confirmed with our own safety if the time was still this time — he said it was. The queue was completely stalled, with over 100 people waiting without any organization.

When, finally, they began to release the entrance, it was a real push-push, totally out of control. My friend ended up falling ugly on the ground because of the mess. And, to make it worse, when we arrived at the entrance, they simply said the time was until 00:30 – something completely different from what they had informed before.

In addition to the absurd disorganization, we were treated with grossness and disrespect. A disappointing experience from beginning to end. Total lack of respect for the public.",1

Tourists avoid,Visited last night... 3 English tourist women. First queued in the wrong queue and then got told to move to another. System was confusing. They charged us €30 entry each to get in which we did think was a lot and now thinking back they overcharged us as we were English. The club was full of very young people I suspect some were underage. Some looked like children. The drink tokens they gave us were for 3 drinks each and they were awful. Tasted like water. When we went to leave the bouncers were asking why and one blocked us briefly which I thought was odd. Would NOT recommend if you're a tourist visiting. From reading other reviews after visiting I'm just glad we didn't have a worse experience.,1
Waiter takes advantage of me,"Don’t go to this disco, I do NOT recommend it at all, I had a horrible experience, a bald waiter with a tattoo on his arm was disgusting and touched my ass, yelled and the waiter laughed in my face...

1 of my friend was Portuguese,and 2 of us was not.First they told us we can not go in because of guest lists,but we had guest lists,than security told us we can not go
In because we were wearing shorts lol,but there was a lot of portuguese people wearing shorts(and there is not dress code)of course they were liars,it was not the problem,the problem is that we are not from portugal.I recommend everyone not to go there!!!!Trust me guys they are very bad people(security)they wanted us to pay them much more to go inside!RACISTS!",1
"HORRENDOUS, LIKE TO SHOT THE RACIST SECURITY GUY IN THE FACE. SHOULD BE CLOSED","CLUB WITH POOR INFORMATION.

Racismo e Discriminação,"Esta discoteca para além da fama tem o proveito de serem racistas.
Fui sair com um grupo de amigos e quando nos estamos a deslocar para a fila foi comunicado, a um de nós que conhecia um coordenador, que haviam pessoas que do nosso grupo. Quando foi questionado o porquê foi-nos apontado primeiramente que o problema das pessoas em questão era a bolsa, ao qual tinhamos solução pois traziamos carro. De seguida, discursam o seguinte: ""Hoje é sabado e temos de ser seletivos com as pessoas que entram. Vêm para aqui de bolsa, com aquele cabelo, oculos de sol e pronto são pretos"" isto numa conversa super informal. Após o resto do grupo ter entrado, sem eles, foram mais que muitas pessoas com óculos, de bolsas, de fato de treino (a salientar que não era o caso dos meus amigos).
É muito triste a ""seleção"" que esta discoteca faz, pois pessoas bêbedas e que estão predispostos a arranjar confusão por meras coisas têm prioridade pela cor de pele e ou indumentária.",1
Terrible experience,"Don’t go into to this nightclub the bouncers will not let you in and discriminate, if there is a group of 3 boys, especially if you are black. They will coerce into buying a table for 300 or 500 euros if you want to go in the nightclub.",1
TERROR TRAUMATIZANTE DE NOITE,"Fui com um grupo de amigos na Lust in Rio. Um horror de lembrança desse lugar. Estávamos numa mesa reservada com direito a consumação. Pediram nossas comandas para anotar os pedidos e a partir daí não devolveram. Na hora de irmos embora, disseram que estava tudo OK só que os BRUTOS E RECALCADOS SEGURANÇAS NA SAÍDA, se juntaram e começaram a implicar e agredir do nada . porque não tínhamos a comanda, sendo que nos disseram que estava tudo ok. BRASILEIROS não são nada bem vindos nesse local . Se querem ter respeito e ser respeitado NÃO VÁ A ESSE LOCAL . Bando de covardes ... juro, uns 10 seguranças batendo em 2 ! GOSTARIA muito que o gerente deste dito maldito lugar, revisse as camêras de segurança, para ver o quanto estão se prejudicando... pois no que depender de mim, esse local está DESCARTADO DE VEZ como indicação. Fica a dica!! NÃO VÁ IMAGINDO SE DIVERTIR E SAIR APANHANDO DE COVARDES",1
Terrible,Worst club I have ever been to. They let minors (im talking 14 year olds) in. Terrible. Disgusting environment.,1
A espera de uma resposta,"Bom dia,
Espero que como um espaço que deseja crescimento ( ainda mais ) que essa crítica seja levada a sério e compartilhada (no mínimo) com a equipe de seguranças.
Vou sempre ao Lust, e sempre defendo quando dizem algo sobre o espaço, entretanto ontem tive a falar com um dos seguranças na entrada na qual foi bem simpático e por eu dizer que quase sempre não enfrentava filas me ofereceu a entrada de 12€ e trocou pela de 15€ ( o que não fez grande diferença, mas pronto) ENTRETANTO logo no fim da festa por volta das 5/6 hrs esbarrei com ele, agradeci e disse que havia gostado da festa, ele muito ousado pegou minha mão e esfregou nas suas partes íntimas, eu me assustei e disse “ei, está louco?” Eu estava com uma amiga e ela não percebeu, chamei para irmos embora porque fiquei muito desconfortável, e contei a ela o ocorrido, ela foi logo chamar atenção dele, o que óbvio que não foi NADA porque ele riu na cara dela! Afinal o que é uma mulher chingar um homem e ainda mais segurança não é?
Tenho amigos influentes nas redes sociais e não me importaria nada de manchar (novamente) o nome da discoteca, como aconteceu com o caso das seringas! O que espero é mesmo uma tomada de atitude por parte do Lust.
Como mulher me senti ridícula, como se não pudesse fazer nada, espero um resposta, o que ele fez é muito grave e não vai ser perdoado",1
Worst experience ever!,"Worst place ever! The security are very racist and they don’t respect you! NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE! Moreover, when I try to left they charged me more than they should…",1

Uma bosta toda organização do evento,"Equipa de segurança e equipe de recepção uma bosta , não sabem te informar nada e só quer ficar escolhendo quem entra e quem não entra na balada. Pois cheguei ontem na balada as 23:30 horas para ir comemorar um aniversário de um amigo com mais amigos e assim estávamos na fila, quando o segurança pega e finge que iria liberar nois e acaba nos desviando da fila e fala que a fila não era la e que era outra fila, fui na outra fila mandaram retornar novamente para onde o segurança tinha acabado de falar que não era aquela fila e sendo que eu estava com nome na guest list e todos que estavam na fila também estava com o mesmo qr code que o meu para entrar… aí eu pergunto para o segurança onde que eu entro e ele fala que é festa privada e isso e aquilo sendo que tem guest list e meu nome estava na lista e eles não deixaram entrar, isso é uma falta de consideração, pois eu não estou pedindo nada de graça e sim estou pagando para entrar, nunca mais volto nesse lixo de balada",1
Gin em copo de vidro...só ao sabado á noite,"fomos numa 5º feira e após o jantar no Envy ( mau), passámos á sala para beber um copo e ouvir música. Ao dirigir-me ao bar, pedi um gin tónico e em copo de vidro. Foi-me tentado explicar que apenas os cocktails eram servidos em copos de vidro e que á quinta feira as bebidas como o gin nao podiam ser servidas em copo de vidro. dirigi-me ao bar do ENVY a 20 metros e foi-me servido tal como pedi. Retornei ao bar e a "" responsável"", de nome Mafalda tentou explicar-me o inexplicável. Para teenagers será uma noite inesquecível, mas para "" cotas"" desaconselho.",2
THEY ARE RACIST. SÃO RACISTAS SIM.,"If you're looking for a place to enjoy the night, don't go to Lust in Rio. THEY ARE RACIST. SÃO RACISTAS SIM.
Ontem 20/02 o tema da festa era Carnaval aproveitando a véspera de feriado. Fui eu e uma amiga com o nome na gest para garantir e íamos pagar (não sabíamos quanto porque já era 1h) e na fila encontramos dois amigos (blacks) e decidimos então entrar os 4. Quando nos aproximamos mais da porta um segurança nos separou dos demais da fila e o outro nos disse que tínhamos que pagar 5000€ se quiséssemos entrar. Éramos o único grupo com negros. Não nos davam um justificação por nos terem tirado da fila, já se via uma certa agressividade nas falas do segurança, e os meninos (que não falavam português) super confusos com a situação e se sentiram mal porque acharam que não entramos por culpa deles. Eu fiquei em choque e fiz o seguinte comentário “nós sabemos exatamente o motivo por não nos deixarem entrar” e o segurança responde “não é isso que estás a pensar”. Todos entravam menos nos e ele sabia o que eu estava a pensar. Fomos embora aproveitar a noite noutro lugar que fomos bem recebidos e isto é para vos alertar. Eu nunca mais la volto RACISTAS",1
Seguranças tratam mal as pessoas,"Horrível. Mais de uma vez tive péssima experiência com seguranças. São estranhos, agressivos, discriminatórios. Toda a gente se queixa do mesmo no lust. Tratam as pessoas mal!",1
Bad,"I didn't enjoy any music whatsoever, wayters very close to you treat you in the first person and they touch you, the staff with a bad mood and bad will not providing clear information about the facilities, the cost of the drinks are too high for the season, I don't recommend.",1
RACISM +++++,"DO NOT BOTHER. Giving this club 1 star is generous. Most disgusting behaviour from this club. Went for a night out for my friends hen do, waited in the queue for 1hr and then were asked to wait to the side. After realising other people were being let in we asked what was wrong and they said there was no way we would be let in. Said we needed a reservation but were letting large groups of other (lighter skin toned) groups in without a reservation. Also said because we were Muslims (which we aren’t) we had no chance. Ruined my friends hen, never been so disgusted in our lives. Absolute vile, ignorant and genuinely pathetic behaviour - almost feel sorry for these incredibly small minded people still clearly living in the 15th century.",1
Péssimo,Deveriam melhorar os vossos seguranças. Proibir a entrada de quem está bem vestido simplesmente pq não foi com a cara do meu amigo por ser de cor. É simplesmente ridículo. Segurança que nem educação tem. Sem falar que até guest tínhamos e foi antes da 1h. Pedi o livro de reclamações com educação e fingiram que não estava ali. Não recomendo de todo.,1
Disappointed,"We came to have a nice evening with friends, but the security staff at the entrance was the most unfriendliest one if ever met. There was nobody except us (5 people) in front of the club door, not drunk and not high. The security wanted to charge us 20€ for the girls and 30€ for the boys, although the club was closing within an hour (at least they told us so). They gave us no answer to the questions we asked and in general they were so extremely unfriendly, we were so disappointed about that behaviour because we came with a complete positive expectation to Lisboa. I don't know why, but maybe because we did not speak any Portuguese. I don't want to blame them for rassism but for incompetence, aggressiveness and no manners at all.",1
Racist experience,RACIST!!! If you are a black do not go here. They are very rude and turn away black people. I am an American who traveled to Portugal for the first time and felt so unwelcome at Lust Rio.,1
Worst club in Lisbon,Don’t waste your time going. Bouncer was physically violent and drinks were 25 dollars. Thats if they let you in. I saw them reject many people just because they were a group of guys. Bouncer has an ego issue,1
Horrid,Horrible place . Went with me and one person . Apparently you need a “membership to get in” place is a joke with power tripped bouncers for no reason at all. We look good so there is no reason for no entry . Makes no sense,1
Bad treatments. Hotel without stalls. Don't trust,"Worst hotel I've stayed in so far.
We were placed in a room that clearly had problems with ventilation. We informed them, they said they couldn't do anything for us. 300 euros a day thrown in the trash.
The trunkier tried to coordinate the air conditioning, without success.
WE HAD TO SLEEP WITH 27 DEGREES OF HEAT, PAYING 300 EUROS A DAY BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR US. MY MOTHER HAS PROBLEMS WITH HEAT (FOGACHOS). You had a bad time all night. I explained and nobody cared
We gave more than 4 hours to resolve but Nothing.

4 stars?? NUNCA

SHYNESS I DO NOT RECOMMEND,"NOT RECOMMENDABLE
No wonder to see so many negative reviews here. Lux of shit ☺️
I only went there once, (20 years ago) and I didn't even get a fan.
I went yesterday 12-04-2025 just because of the birthday of a friend, who had entered minutes earlier in a group of 6 men to pay 15€, were not consumables.
They paid for everything they drank extra.
The other 6 we did not enter because we had to have a name in the GUEST. 🤣🤣🤣
To sum up the Porter is elite and ridiculous as well as the situation itself (I don't mean the entire security team/porters)
But if throughout the queue and during the about 20 minutes that took our walk, until they informed us that we could not enter... the super polite security who asked if anyone had tickets, maybe could inform that you only enter with name in the GUEST. Preventing us from wasting our time.
I imagine they don't need the consumption that I and other people would do. But I also waited for entry. Joined the useful to the pleasant 👍🏼
But there were those who wanted to enter and ended up seeing their night lost / spoiled by this kind of attitudes.
It's people that give ma fame to the locals.
NOT RECOMMENDABLE",1
.,One of the worst clubs in Lisbon. A QI below 30 equals an entry. If you go = to safety you will ...................,1
"A shame, xenophobia.","Never been blocked in my whole life.
But in Lux yes, right at the entrance around one in the morning.
Their excuse as they had nothing to pick up was to say that it was only for guests, and for me everything was ok.
Even clients who often go there tell me that it's a lie there was nothing and that was normal in Lux.
When taking a taxi to the hotel the taxi driver also told me the same that was normal with outside people.

A real shame.
If you are not from Lisbon I do not recommend passing there because you will only really take a walk.",1
Poorly trained security,"Few employees care poor security loves to humiliate or block foreigners, less traffickers or ordinary people",1

lux fragil lisbon,"terrible awful place. never go, they denied us because of an apparent guest list and failed to ask any others that were queued behind us if they were on said guest list. wouldn’t recommend !",1
Negative Review for Lux Fragil,"I arrived at Lux Fragil at 11:30 PM, dressed appropriately, and was still turned away. The club seemed empty, yet the bouncer claimed there was a guest list and a private party. However, I saw four Portuguese people in alternative clothing being let in right before me. What a waste of time! Very disappointing to be treated this way. I definitely do not recommend this place.",1
The most negative night experience,"Never in my entire life had I been denied entry to a place because of my nationality, I understand that that is racism, the literal phrase was, ""Spanish do not enter"", a brown girl at the entrance, q nor did she look us in the face, with horrifying ways and lacking any education, as there can be such a place and absolutely no one takes action in the matter in a city like Lisbon.",1
Luz is the worst club in Lisbon,1 out of 5 experience. Getting in was some creepy lady picking whether or not she thought you looked cool enough to get in. Once you got in there was a terrible DJ and no one was dancing. It was extremely uncomfortable and there are many better places to go in Lisbon.,1
Terrible - don't go here,"Actually the worst place ever. Don't waste your time - service was rude and horrible, drinks watered down, and boring & empty inside since they reject so many people. Go anywhere else this place sucks.",1

To avoid,Invented a guest list so as not to let us in. Very disappointing when the club is far from full. Avoid this club,1
Don't waste time,"Rude and rude, they leave you out for no reason.

I hope it closes soon.",1
Decline,"For years it was election night, good memories, which are long gone.... The entrance looks like the selection for eternal life, from the top of its pedestal they give, or not, the blessing, the metal portico is directed by Cruella Vile, who gives completely disrespectful orders, as if we were rude children, then we are rushed, as if on an assembly line, to pay for two guys ""so are they going to pay or not..."", when I dared to comment on the The lack of education in these three events calls for a completely biased security guard to intimidate us....It's a huge FAVOR that Lux Frágil does in welcoming us... I don't know where you lost your education and your ""talant de bien faire"". ..I remember times when both existed.",1
Racist bouncers,"As many comments say, my friends and I were (after 50 minutes of waiting) confronted with disrespectful and openly racist bouncers, giving us a rate of 300€ per person because we were ""foreign"" (I am Portuguese) even though other groups were able to return by paying 10€...

Disgusting,"Disgusting site. All the staff are rude, the children in the cloakroom make fun of customers. Horrible",1
Poor racist service,Terrible and racist place. Do not go. So many other places in Lisbon to enjoy a fun night out. Rude door staff with no customer service training or skills. I have been to many top clubs around the world and have never experienced such bad service. It should be closed or taken over by a proper management. Ridiculous environment when compared to other places in Lisbon.,1

Members Only,"Event at ra.co. When you get there, they pretend it's a members club. I don't recommend this place. No willingness to compromise, no discussion and no understanding at the door.",1
"We were blocked from entering the club by security guards who threatened, insulted and tried to attack us.","The security guards didn't let us in and even wanted to beat us; First they said we could go in, that we had to wait in line, when it was our turn they said we wouldn't go in there;
There was a female security guard who said that we didn't have the right qualifications to enter, that we were lazy;
There was a security guard there with gray hair who only knew how to threaten and talk aggressively for us to leave...
They had to call more security guards to attack us, it was a shame, we were 5 peaceful and polite boys without any malice and these security guards behaved in a way that would shame anyone.
We will file criminal charges against these individuals.",1
Bad service!,"Terrible!!!

In dozens of years of nights and a lifetime spent going to #movida# alfacinha (I was born and live in Lx), I confess that I still managed to be surprised by the arrogance and arrogance of the service at this house, Lux!!!

After asking, through a phone call made in the afternoon, if there would be any event that night, because I intended to take my daughter and niece to see the Lux club, when we arrived at Lux's door, we were blocked, with the opposite indication, that there would be an event. .

I explained that I had been told, but the insensitive receptionist didn't even want to know...

At the very least, I would have tried to understand what happened or provide another solution, but no, I would say that the arrogance and stupidity is extreme.

As for me, this house shouldn't even be open, I'll never go back there again...!! 😞😠🤬😡

RACIST DO NOT GO,We arrived at Lux and was told because we weren’t on the guest list we was not allowed entry. Then we read the reviews and seen that this was a common thing for English. We then found some Portuguese people in the queue who also weren’t on the “guest list” yet they was allowed in. If you are english you ain’t getting in this place.

I seriously don't recommend it, they are poor people in spirit, clueless!

"It is a collection of stands and restaurants: original, but far too expensive.

Boring and nothing new,"The truth is that I don't know why this site is so successful. This is a series of clothing or food stores, with prices that are not cheap. In addition, it is quite far from the rest of Lisbon's attractions. It is not worth wasting so much travel time to visit it.",1
AVERAGE….. ;-(,If you have an hour to waste or just to have a drink...the rest isn't really great...we're being sold a bit of the dream in the guides,2
Bof bof !,Pas d’interet. Pas grand chise à voir. Pas d’artisans comme il est dit dans les descritptifs. Quelques boutiques de souvenirs. Aucun interet.,2
Divertente,"Posto carino e innovativo con differenti proposte di cibo, drink e cibo. Da vedere soprattutto con l atmosfera serale.",2
Tourist trap,"Tourist trap to the fullest! The idea of it sounded great, but once we got there you can see it screams this is for tourists. Some may love it, but not for us.",1
Worth seeing once,"That’s definitely a tourist trap. Worth seeing once? Maybe. Worth spending money here? Not so sure. It’s interesting to see the graffiti art and enjoy the design itself, but the quality of the food is questionable in the majority of the places.",2
Caça-turista,"Super caça turista. Restaurantes claramente para turistas com preços salgados. Livraria Ler Devagar é muito bonita, você vai ver várias fotos por aí - o que as fotos não mostram é a camada de pó que cobre os livros.",2
Yawnnnnnnnnn!!,In and out of the few shops in 20-30 minutes. Dont waste you time. Might be nice in 5-6 years. Better attractions elsewhere. ( This is NOT not an attraction).,1
Pas nécessaire,"Il y a mieux à faire à Lisbonne , une rue avec des restaurants et des bars dans d’anciens entrepôts avec quelques boutiques. De mon point de vue cela ne vaut pas le détour.",2
Franchement à éviter,"Étant motivées pour découvrir cet endroit de Lisbone et plus précisément le quartier d Alcantara, quelle fut notre déception en arrivant sur les lieux 😳😳
Beaucoup de bars, fast foot ou autres...🤪🤪 et lorsqu'on a trouvé des boutiques, que de la vente de bijoux , de faïence et 2/3 boutiques de vêtements 🙄🙄
Vraiment bizarre... dans les étages supérieurs, des bureaux, salles de danse...on n'a rien compris .🙃🙃
Bref... si on avait su 😤😤
Aucun intérêt pour notre part",2
Mercado alternativo de pega (o de pago).,"El lugar espectacular, la idea, el concepto... Pero al final está enfocado a un público de poder adquisitivo medio-alto. Muy caro para lo que es, mercado moderno a precio ""moderno"", camuflado de alternativo.",2
Grosse déception,Pourquoi faire venir le touriste dans une zone peu commerciale quelques boutiques sans intérêt on a l’impression qu on veut faire revivre un quartier ! On a de quoi faire à Lisbonne ! Sans faire des kms …,2
Mistreatment,"The people in this store are very incompetent, they don't know how to treat customers properly, and they don't understand anything about laws, because I bought a kaabo scooter and it broke the steering bar 2 days ago without even an accident, which is a consumer's right. I went to exchange it for another one and was told that I couldn't exchange it, I would have to send it to Spain because it was considered my misuse, and when I started saying that I didn't use it badly and then the aggression started, don't go to this store, it has to close",1
"""flea market"" = fake","Nothing to do with a flea market, just handicrafts, ceramics and clothing. Nice restaurant. Nice reuse of an old factory site.",1
Tourist shopping - this is why I visited Portugal?,"A number of small tables or “pop up” (although they are hardly temporary) stores. Some interesting stuff and many places to get some food.

I suppose if you like that sort of thing, then you’ll like this. But there’s an entire historic city and mom/pop restaurants that need seeing.",2
The 'Trendy' Stale Urine-Scented LX Market,"I visited LXMarket last Sunday, and my experience left much to be desired. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by the faint smell of stale urine, which I assumed was a lingering reminder of the previous evening's binge drinking by LXFactory patrons. The market appeared to be filled with overpriced items that catered to a specific hipster aesthetic. It seemed as though people were pretending to be poor while overindulging in trendy consumerism.

Most of the market stalls offered nearly identical merchandise, characterized by items associated with attention-seeking individuals who want to signal their pretentious personalities by appearing ""modern,"" ""unpretentious,"" and ""cool."" It appeared as though many of these products were designed to fit a particular photocopied lookalike style.

The entire experience struck me as superficial and contrived. It felt like the market was more about creating a facade or image than offering anything of real value. I couldn't help but notice the irony of people pretending to be poor while purchasing overpriced items. It seemed as though they were trying to adopt a certain aesthetic without truly understanding or embracing the values that should accompany it.

I also couldn't fathom how anyone could justify buying poor-quality, overpriced food in an environment with the persistent background aroma of stale urine.

Overall, my visit to LXMarket was disappointing. It appeared to be a place where people go to put on a show rather than experience anything genuine or authentic. It's a location where individuals can purchase the illusion of being cool, modern, and unpretentious, but ultimately fall short of achieving those ideals.

Additionally, it's worth noting that LXMarket is a reflection of a larger trend towards gentrification and the displacement of working-class communities. The LXFactory area, where the market is located, was once a thriving industrial hub but has transformed into a trendy neighborhood with high rents and expensive boutiques in recent years. This transformation has resulted in the displacement of many working-class residents who used to live and work in the area.

LXMarket, in many ways, symbolizes the negative aspects of what Lisbon has become. It's a place where people can consume the illusion of authenticity while the real authenticity of the neighborhood is being erased.",1
Avoidable,"More or less a trap: nothing that you can't find around Lisbon, you can easily do without it.",2
In my opinion it’s a scam,"Unfortunately, this museum visit was a major letdown and definitely not worth the price of admission. The exhibitions consisted mostly of uninspired photographs by unknown or amateur photographers, contemporary paintings lacking depth, and low-quality art installations that looked like student projects from a local fine arts academy.

The only redeeming feature is the building itself — a stunning piece of architecture that blends beautifully with the coastal landscape and complements the nearby bridge in a truly striking way. But you can admire that from the outside for free, which I would highly recommend over paying to go inside.

Save your money and enjoy the view from the outside.",1
Negligible,"In my opinion it is not really worth it, there is nothing of architecture, except the structure itself, very nice to see outside, but it is not worth paying the ticket to see a fairly insignificant contemporary art exhibition and reproductions of a boiler and a hydroelectric plant",1
No,"Pretty lame museum. Hole of uc.

Plenty of room for two or three pictures that anyone can take.

All the opposite of the Macau Museum which is: very dense and interesting.

So museum to avoid. And if you look at the admission price: to flee",1
Crazy rejection,"Maybe I prefer classical art like Caravaggio, Monet, Van Gogh, but also modern art, if we talk about Warhol, De Chirico, etc.
Here were his exhibitions one on plays of light and shadow projections... the other huge canvases hung with a jumble of colors...
Lost time 😩",1
Not really worth the money for what it is,"The modern building was beautiful but once inside the exhibits were not really worth writing home about however the older, former water plant building next door was much better. I would have spent more time in there but the friend I was with was not enjoying it as much as I was",2
Bad art,"It's mostly technology. This exhibition is quite exciting and well done. Art is a little short. The modern museum or gallery is small and unfortunately shows the works of a completely unknown American ""artist"" who apparently thinks she can replace quality with quantity. Really rarely seen such bad art.",2
"Unfortunately, a visit is not worth it","Interesting architecture. But unfortunately, the visit is not worth it. Very disappointingly small variety of exhibitions. Looking from the outside and going to the observation deck is completely enough.",1
Don't waste your time here,"This muesum has two buildings; a modern building and an old brick building. As of this date, the modern one has just two exhibits. Some art kids painted on canvas. A second that is a little more interesting that used light and screens in a dark room.

The second building has some art. And, there's a large walking tour of steam powered electric power generation. Many of the motors are cut open for viewing the inner parts of these turbines.
But, the tour is not well marked, no arrows on the floor, there's no guide to explain things. Easy to get lost among the huge boilers and coal pits, as we did. It's not worth the 11 euro per person.",2
Not acceptable,"The museum's website said it was open on December 25, and it even made me buy tickets. I went there and it was closed. Such a thing is unacceptable",1
Disappointed,"I long wanted to visit Maat, regretted. The most interesting is on the outside.
By purchasing the ticket you can also visit the old electricity museum, which has better content than the Maat.",2
Evidence that exterior counts!,"The highlight is clearly the exterior, both the new as well as the old building. Save the money of the entrance fee and enjoy the exterior!",2
boring. do not go inside. cool building,super boring. nothing to see. wasted 10€ for fake woke bull. exhibits were made by a child who discovered internet for the first time. my grandma wouldve made a better exhibition on african culture and she is from the balkans.,1
11 Euros poorer and a half hour older. Another flashy building with nothing in it.,"Seriously- The first building is just a power plant. Pipes and boilers and stuff. They did a heck of a job painting and polishing it, but it's just a power plant. I spent two minutes looking at stuff, and 18 minutes looking for the exit.

The gallery building featured a drum circle covered with a macrame tent, and a second room with framed random Polaroids. In and out in five minutes.

It's not just the money I was conned out of though- it's the precious hours of my holiday time getting there and back

11 Euro and my afternoon for this? Don't be a sucker like me.",1
Very disappointing. But nice view from the outside. Only visit the Electricity part!,"We visited both museums, that is, the electricity building that was quite interesting and beautiful from the inside and outside, and the modern art museum, that was really worthless and deceiving.
The building of the MAAT is quite amazing, specially when you're standing on the top of it, with a beautiful view. But, the exhibition there was, except the percussion part, really unadapted for young children (the pictures), and there was even a very disrespectful comment about Marine le Pen in one of the pictures shown (regardless of the fact that I like her or not).
The colors exhibition was of no interest at all. Art is a question of taste, for sure, but this cannot even be considered art. We were very disappointed and deceived by the art propositions in such a beautiful and respected city as Lisboa.
I do not recommend the restaurant at the MAAT itself either. Extremely expensive and the Caesar salad was very dull and simple. For 16€ we expected more than just green leaves and a bit of chicken. And 3,5€ for a tiny bottle of water is also robbery.",1
Beautiful building. Poor in art.,"A very nice building on the outside and inside, but a trifle of exhibitions. They call it architecture and the one at the entrance couldn't tell me why. The one with interesting engineering, but difficult for lay people to understand. And art doesn't even look ji is expected.",2
MAAT is not recommended,"What could be disappointing about art, architecture, and technology? I don't know how they did it, but this was probably the worst museum I've ever visited. The building itself is beautiful! But there was nothing inside either of the two buildings to make it worth the trip. I know that the architecture of Portugal is stunning but none of that was featured in the museum. The technology might be a nerd's delight but seeing all those steam engines and power generators were boring to me. I do not recommend this museum.",1
Not worth a visit,"Expected more architecture, but only the museum is the architecture piece. Art was displayed in the basement but exhibition was only the underwater reefs photography. Technology was found in the Tepco power station but only focused on Energy. Overall felt it was not worth 12 euros per person entry ticket",2
Huge disappointment.,"Museum of Arts changing collection, there is just the basement with some underwater photos and color gradients that are not very understandable. At the electricity museum in the old electrical factory, the first floor with the turbines and alternators was closed to visitors because...privatized for a party with boom boom music. An absolute shame!
Matt reimbursed us for the €34 ticket due to this scandal. This is unfortunately not an exception in Europe.",2
A FREE TICKET,"I've been wanting to visit MAat for some time now, more specifically the Joana Vasconcelos exhibition...I was a little disappointed. Although there was an interview with her... there was no paper support, just a leaflet in English, nor audio support. Not even a QR code to use with your cell phone to be able to enjoy a visit more informative
It was a FREE TICKET, with little to retain and in my opinion not very comprehensive.",2
Fraud,"On the day of the visit, the weather was bad and half of the exhibition was closed. There was no refund of the value of the tickets or advance information, nor the possibility of using the tickets for another day",1
Horrible and disastrous bordering on ridiculous,"A place where you really can't judge a book by its cover, since it has a beautiful facade with a stunning view of the river from the roof for free and while inside it's proof that art is no longer made like it used to be with pieces of anything for people who think they are artists! In addition to unnecessary apologies made as ""freedom of expression"", which is actually an incentive for the practices represented by so-called ""works""",1
Horrible,Worst exhibition ever seen by the “artist” Joana Vasconcelos. Absolutely horrible. They should pay us to watch this…,1
MAAT - A communications disaster.,We were really looking forward to seeing this on our recent visit to Lisbon. The architecture of the buildings was beautiful but the main galleries were closed - just a few bits and pieces to see in the Power station. What made this so annoying was that we visited on Sunday and were told that the main gallery was closed that day for a event but we could visit the Power Station. We returned later in the week to be told the main galleries were closed for refurbishment. None of this is communicated anywhere. Website makes no reference to this. Tourist offices have not been informed. It does take a bit of effort to get there so it was very frustrating. Even when you get there there is no signposting so finding the entrance itself is an effort. Five stars for the architecture but zero for the management and the communications.,1
The place is CLOSED!!!,"The place is CLOSED!!!
There was nothing about it on the website. We bought tickets on their website without any information that it was closed. Traveled far to get there. Then it was closed. When we asked how we could get the money back for the tickets, they said we could use the tickets at another museum that looks like a technical museum. We were not interested in another museum. Money out the window",1
Disappointing visit to Maat,The structure is very particular and offers a beautiful view of the Tagus river but inside the museum only offers an exhibition on plastic recycling and the other building houses the machinery of a former power plant which is not interesting to me,1
Modest art? No thank you!,"Exceptional view, superb architecture. Very pleasant café, with friendly staff and very welcome beer in front of the Tejo at sunset. One detail: the contents are very lacking (which for a contemporary art museum is no small problem!!). The installations of ""modest art"" are truly unworthy of such a noble place, despite the admirable efforts of the curators...Why not put a little more effort into finding works that are worth the price that visitors pay for the ticket?",2
Geen aanrader,"Wij vonden dit museum echt een flop. Van buiten prachtig en bovenop een mooi uitzicht. Flink stuk gelopen om er te komen, maar van binnen stelt het vrij weinig voor. Strenge beveiliging. Tassen moeten in een kluis. Hele aparte kunst, niet onze smaak. Op internet leek het heel wat voor te stellen, maar ik zou er lekker langs lopen en van het uitzicht bij de kust genieten.",2
Don't waste your money,"We were bored to tears. The art was unimaginative and there was an exhibition on plastic which was extremely dull. The second building had a tour of some large steam boilers, which was about as interesting as it sounds.",1
Une super coquille vide,Une coquille vide ... le musée paraît superbe de l extérieur mais l expo ... jouets et explication ecologique du plastique (c est connu depuis 15 ans) ... vide ... par contre très le point de vue est superbe ... se poser au café du musée avec le pont du 25 avril en panorama c est grandiose ...,2
"Mehr Schein als sein, man muss es sich SCHÖN trinken.","Absolute Enttäuschung. Wir waren schon in sehr vielen Museen in Nord- und Mitteleuropa, aber haben noch nie so wenig gesehen/erlebt. Schade, die Gebäude von außen haben viel versprochen aber wenig gehalten.

Das rote alte Gebäude wird wohl Elektroingenieure ansprechen oder alle die im Kraftwerksbereich unterwegs sind und gerne Schaltpläne lesen.

Das „Kunstmuseum“ bietet nur 2 Räume, in einem steht/hängt wenig drinnen und im anderen eigentlich nichts. Vielleicht sollte man davor ausreichend Sangria oder Portwein zu sich nehmen und sich die Ausstellung „schön“ trinken.

Investiert das Geld lieber in der Markthalle, die bietet auch Architektur und guten Geschmack.",1
The most awful museum ever!,"The worst museum experience ever! Totally incoherent and poorly organized. It was next to impossible to find the entrance. I crossed the footbridge, saw no sign whatsoever pointing to the ticket counter. I wandered haphazardly and found the entrance to one building. They staff were incapable of pointing me to the entrance to the former power station building. When I finally found the other entrance, I hadn’t noticed the ticket office off to one side, easy to overlook. I presented my ticket at the labeled “entrance” and was told I had to go upstairs to have my ticket scanned for entry. Basically I spent 20 minutes trying to find how to get inside, and only 20 minutes inside, since there was virtually nothing to see but a few random “contemporary” art installations that held no interest whatsoever. Complete waste of time and money.",1
The absolute worst bar none,This museum was a dumpster fire. Literally awful. The building itself is a beauty to behold. Stunning. I was expecting something about architecture or at least beauty inside. Instead what I got was disgusting interactive exhibits on war protests and utter nonsense. Totally a waste. The worst museum I have ever been to.,1
Spild af tid,Værste museum jeg nogensinde har besøgt. Fuldstændig ligegyldig udstilling og stort set intet at se.,1
Gebakken lucht,"Dichte zalen, geen liften (afgesloten), heel kleine tentoonstellingen. Prachtig design gebouw, aan de binnenkant teleurstellend.",2
"Nada de arte, vergonzoso.","Edificio vistoso pero incómodo, lleno de escaleras , mal señalizado, dividido, para pasar de uno a otro hay que salir (a veces bajo lluvia) y no está clara la entrada al siguiente. ¿Arte? Cero. Otro eslabón más del fraude que significa el 95% del auto proclamado ""arte contemporáneo"". Decía Horacio que ""una obra de arte es un poema sin palabras"". Pues aquí hay sólo palabrerío que intenta desesperadamente justificar la ausencia total de talento y técnica en quienes pretenden ser artistas y curadores simplemente militando en alguna causa o teniendo amigos que les facilitan indebidamente exponer. ¡Qué pérdida de tiempo y dinero! No pongo duración recomendada porque no recomiendo la visita.",1
Vraiment déçus de l'intérieur des bâtiments !,"La note concerne l'intérieur des deux bâtiments en rapport avec le tarif d'entrée.
Nous nous sommes fait piéger par le nom ""Musée d'architecture et de technologie"" ! Le musée est divisé en deux parties : le bâtiment futuriste (expositions d'oeuvres modernes pour le côté ""Art"" (pas beaucoup à voir, pas de lien entre les expos) et l'ancienne usine électrique voisine (donc, vous visitez...une ancienne usine, repeinte certes, mais qui ne nous a pas vraiment intéressée).
Tout ça pour la modique somme de 9e/pers (notre Lisboa Card de 72h avait expiré).
Comme l'a dit Chloedo28, le meilleur du musée est à l'extérieur. Du toit du MAAT à la forme arrondie et sympa (dans l'espace public), vous pourrez admirer le pont du 24 juillet au coucher de soleil.",1
Waste of money,"Unless you are into modern and bizarre art, don’t waste your money. The best of MAAT is seen from the outside for free. Interesting looking building and nice view from the roof…both free.",1
Very disappointing,"Praised by tour guides, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lisbon is particularly disappointing: poor collections, almost no works by the great contemporary masters, huge spaces almost empty. No point. For €15, you are also entitled to the adjoining ""architecture center"" (not to be confused with the MAAT), simply lamentable.",1
"If you like this sort of art, great.","For me personally, I didn't like it. Most of the exhibits were too abstract for me. A canvas where most of it is just black paint with bits of something on the edge doesn't classify as art in my mind.
The architecture part was a single section with exhibits that seemed to have little to do with buildings or design. One exhibit was a tv screen with men making odd noises.
I hoped for much more varied works, so I'm somewhat disappointed.
There was a very helpful lady who directed me to the loo, but most staff seemed too cool for school.",1
Negative value for money,"Value for money-negative price
The museum currently has a closed section. Some noteworthy work related to pop art, but otherwise not worth it. Cost €15 adults too much for what it offers, 7.50 students",1
Parking mess,"Parking lot only accepts cash--not terribly ""contemporary"". No ATMs nearby. Wasted an hour just trying to get out of the lot!",1
Disgusting and disturbing!,"This so called art exhibition included a photograph of a man masturbating, a picture of a naked woman with a fresh scar from having a surgery for ectopic pregnancy, a picture of a naked pregnant woman lying on what looked like a prison floor, two men hanging by their tongues. It was a more a display of dehumanisation than of ‘art’. Not one piece evoked any uplifting emotion. Do not take children to this exhibition!",1
Don’t bother - weird place and unfriendly staff,"Don’t bother. Staff rude, very dismissive, sold us tickets, did not ask if we wanted to pay in pounds or euros- charged us in pounds (more expensive) You should airway pay in local currency. We asked for an Audio guide. They said they did not have one. Turned out it was broken so we could not understand much about the exhibits. We looked for the Jackson Pollocks, which appeared on the leaflet, when we asked where his works were she told us, at the end, that his stuff had gone to another museum- this was one of the few things we wanted to see. There were 2 Picasso paintings, a few Andy Warhols, but apart from that it was weird. ….if you like looking at torn cushion covers which people think is ‘Art’ then go ahead. Cafe also expensive, but comfortable and bright. Waste of time and money in our opinion.",1
Disappointing,"Extremely disappointing.
Except the top floor which presents some interesting works.
Two-thirds of the museum is empty.
It remains art so my review is subjective but I advise against ++",1
The masquerade,"A beautiful museum, interesting artists.
The place is well maintained, the staff is friendly.

At the end of the tour, we decided to drink at the museum café. The milkshake looked good, nothing was less true!
So began the descent into hell...
After an exorbitant Award and long waiting minutes, a certain Pedro decided to ambush us. This drink was nothing but a pancake dough disguised as milkshake.

Yes! You will not believe us, but the milkshake had to be cut with flour and egg white. (Photo attached). Poor Pedro had indeed made the wrong career and had probably interned a few weeks earlier at the local Pasteleria. We then left these milkshakes behind, alone, attracting no one but Pedro who must have made good pancakes. It is with sadness and disgust that we strongly advise you to avoid this place.

The terrace was empty, so there was a reason...",1
Awful,Everybody very rude! Waste of money!!!Don t waste your time there are other museums much more important!!!!just ignore it,1
More like B or C category and unfriendly,Everything B to C - unfriendly staff - the museum obviously prefers that groups go through without explanations. You are not allowed to explain things to your friends. Unbelievable.,1
Your choice,What is modern? The definition is worth asking to you by you before you step inside. We found no answers to that question inside here.,2
Not open during stated hours,Business states open Sunday 10-6. Spent $20 on Uber to show up at 4 pm and it’s closed with no sign. Needs to keep online presence updated with correct hours,1
"As a bad employee, in the middle of a good team, you can lose everything.","I've been to this place for the entire month of October 2024, almost every day. It is the same as saying that I left there about 300 euros (or more).
I will not again put my feet there, due to the incredible lack of education, of notion, of ways, of knowing to be of a single employee.
I get up from my seat and go to the payment box. Once there, the individual in question asks me: ""What was it for?"" This, after I go there daily, as I already mentioned, and I always have a routine behavior. When I say I was in the box, naturally, to pay, I hear on the other side: ""I'm not guessing, I'm not a witch!"" From then on, the level was always going down. Inacreditável. Do all bar employees have divinatory powers except for him? It can only be that, since this situation had never happened to me in all other times, with all the other colleagues of this little character. Nothing to say about the rest of the team working there. Too bad to have this rotten apple there.",1

Raining so hard that other drivers had their flashers on and were driving slower. Daniel was driving too fast for our comfort level and was texting!

Poor Experience with Marlin Lisbon,"Unfortunately we had a poor experience with Marlin. The young staff (crew) were pleasant and great, but management and administration was very poor. Staff were disorganized and we were ultimately ushered on to the wrong, older, smaller and poorly maintained boat - and at no reduction. When we returned from the two-hour tour, the office staff were gone (9pm). The boat was old, dirty, and poorly maintained. The lavatory was gross. The few, gentle follow-up messages sharing of our dissatisfaction were met with no response. The company seems bent on taking advantage of tourists to Lisbon.
This is the first time I’ve ever written a negative review, but I’ll wish to save others similar disappointment. Find an alternative, good experience and enjoy!",2
Disappointment with Lisbon Serviced Apartmenrs,"A big disappointment with Lisbon Serviced Apartmenrs for the mercenary way of treating guests.
I had the car broken down in the parking lot of the place which is extremely tight. I paid in advance for 4 days (80 Euros), but only left 2. Still on site, I requested the refund for the other 2 days, since I did not leave the car there anymore. They did not answer my request and said that this request was only made by email. When I sent the email, they invented the story that the email had to be sent on the date of my refund request. Just shit excuses.

Homofobia Alert,"Local HOMOFÓBICO/ HOMOFOBIA ALERT.

While I was attending a musical concert after having dinner at the aforementioned market, I was approached by a barmaid if I wanted any more drinks, I said no thanks.
In my naivety I thought the bar was going to close and that I was passing by the tables asking that question. But no, there were many more people without drinks who were in the place without drinks on the table. Then an elderly man addresses me in a loud voice and tells me that if I don't consume I have to go out and that I have to behave, this ""bad behavior has to do with the fact that I have my arm resting on someone's shoulder."" another man and we exchanged a few kisses with respect. The guy who is the father of the owner of the place called the security guard and disappeared from the scene. I called the police and filed a complaint with the authorities. Sexual discrimination is a crime in Portugal. Do not visit this place due to homophobia of the owners.

Estando eu a assistir a um concerto musical depois de ter jantado no referido mercado, sou abordado por uma empregada do bar se eu queria mais alguma bebida, disse que não obrigado.
Na minha ingenuidade pensei que o bar ia fechar e que estava a passar pelas mesas a fazer essa pergunta. Mas não, havia muitas mais pessoas sem bebidas que estavam no local sem bebidas na mesa. Depois um senhor de idade dirige-se a mim de voz alta a dizer-me que se não consumo tenho de sair e que me tenho de comportar, isto do ""mau comportamento tem a ver com o facto de estar de braço apoiado no ombro de outro homem e trocamos alguns beijos com o respectivo decoro. O fulano que é pai do dono do local chamou o segurança e desapareceu de cena. Chamei a polícia e apresentei queixa às autoridades. Descriminação sexual é crime em Portugal.

Exaggerated prices. I do not recommend.,"Prices are too high, in some cases, twice as high as on other surfaces. To avoid if you don't want to be fooled.",1
Disappointing,"We are giving this tour 1 star—and only because of two positives:

1. The optional boat ride through the caves was stunning and a highlight.
2. Our driver, Inês, was punctual, kind, and handled a difficult situation with professionalism and care.

The tour experience was extremely disappointing and completely misrepresented. According to the description, we were supposed to visit: Algar Seco, Boneca Cave, Benagil Cave, Praia da Marinha, Praia Dona Ana, the historic town of Lagos.

Instead, all we did was the boat tour, which we could have booked ourselves, and then followed the boat captain’s lunch recommendation. That was it. No other stops, no guided itinerary, and no visits to any of the promised beaches or landmarks.

This was also the driver’s first time doing the tour, and she had not been given any instructions. As we left Lisbon, she had to call the office to ask where to go and what the day’s plan was. She was simply told, “It’s a private tour—just do whatever the guests want.” We were never informed that we’d need to plan the day ourselves.

This was not a curated experience—it was a self-guided day with a driver, and not at all what was advertised. Had we known this, we could have saved money by hiring a private driver and booking the boat directly.

The operator should issue a partial refund for false advertising.",1
Awful service.,You have to buy a card to get into a locked area. Then you have to use the card to get out. My card let me in allright at the Restauradores station but didn't wanna let me out!? Some employee was sitting in a booth but just gestured me angrily away when I approached him for help. In the end I had to do like in NYC in the 80s and jump over the gate. Thought the guy would come screaming after me but no. Just watched me with a bored look. Passersby were also like zombies. What a weird city this is.,1
Disappointing,"Among the worst I have ever tried, little understandable purchase rechargeable card, the employees do not give explanations, indeed they make up stories about residual credit.",2
Nefarious staff,"We have spent a few days in Lisbon as a family, and an extraordinary city with excellent people. The worst the subway staff. Poor manner and unhelpful. Especially last Thursday, August 22nd at 10.30am, 11am in the Parque station next to the Central Park Hotel in Lisbon, Mr q was in the booth next to the ticket machines, q is supposed to be there to help, we tried to ask for information and help with the tickets, but I totally ignored us, not even decent to answer q could not help or something. I pass us absolutely, watching only for himself with a bad book education. It should be somewhere else and not in front of the public. FATAL LISBON METRO WORKER",1
No sales consultants at some stations,Be careful take several tickets when you are a family and not a single card.transportation clean enough. Very easy to navigate,2
Fraut ticketing system,"The payment system on the metro is a an absolute joke. We paid 4 times for trips and the cards wouldn't work correctly. I was with my daughter once of these times and made the mistake of going through the barrier just in front of her. Her credit wouldn't work. So she was sick the other side. She went to the ticket office to sort it out. There was a queue but peopke keep queue jumping. When she got to the front nobody spoke English. She didn't know how to use the ticket machine to try topping up again. She tried to use two of my debit cards which work everywhere else in Lisbon & worked fine to charge me the money they took for trips we didn't make 4 times. I suspect either the cardboard tickets they give you are rubbish and keep failing or its a get rich quick scheme. Either way, it's extremely annoying.",1
Very long times in between trains,"12 minutes or more waiting for the train.
This waiting time is sometimes even longer.
This is happening now on a regular basis, not randomly.",1
Very long times in between trains,"Very slow … at rush hour 10 minutes or more waiting for the train.

Pior experiência da minha vida,"A nível europeu é provavelmente o pior sistema de metro que existe. Fiquem o mais longe possível deste serviço, principalmente linha verde em que circulam metros de 3 carruagens para centenas de pessoas… resultado? Lutas diárias entre pessoas das mais variadas faixas etárias para entrar no metro. Acabam por entrar obviamente os “mais espertos” sendo que os mais debilitados tem obrigatoriamente de esperar pelas proximas.",1
Scammers and thieves,"The worst public transport!
At the first visit, we bought two tickets in the machine at the airport (until we were waiting 15mins in the queue) and the machine gave us only one. So we had to buy another one. After second purchase, the machine gave us also second ticket from the first payment. So we ended with three tickets.
At the second visit, we bought tickets online. The metrolisboa.pt website redirected us to the portalviva.pt website. We choose two 3-days daily tickets and proceed the payment. No confirmation after the payment only the cart with out tickets was shown. The tickets should have come to an email. It is already 5th day, and nothing came. We were calling to the contact support, but the voice was recorded and it was only in Portuguese. We texted an email to contacto@navegante.pt, but few mins later we received an email from their email server that email box is full. It is really sad that public transport of such a big city supports scammers!
They robbed us for our money (in 4 days we spent for public transport in that horrible city almost 80 EUR).
Even when we bought daily tickets at the machines, after some while we realised the tickets are not valid everywhere! There are more public transport providers with different types of tickets and we had no idea which connection we can use and which not! We came to the station, waited 15 minutes for bus, and when in finally came, we found out at the bus driver, that our ticket is not valid. So we had to find another station and another way to our destination.
Except all of these, the metro goes very rarely. We came to the Alameda station on the way to the airport around 7AM during work week and waited almost ten minutes! Once we even couldn't get inside due to mass of people inside!",1
Falta de higiene nas carruagens,"Segunda feira uma criança vomitou numa das carruagens, para grande admiração minha e por coincidência, 2 dias depois entro na mesma carruagem e continua por limpar.

Linha azul. Pergunto-me qual será a regularidade com que limpam as carruagens.",1
"TERRIBLE, STAY AWAY","As a local and user of the metro in the last two decades, I must say the metro is terrible and is currently unusable due to construction works. STAY AWAY!!",1
Disagi,La linea funziona discretamente e collega gran parte della città. Peccato che l'accesso non sia del tutto agevole. Poche sono le fermate con ascensori e scale mobili. Chi ha un passeggino o un carrozzina prova grandissimo disagio ad accedervi. Peccato,2
Guasti perenni di ascensori e scale mobili,Scale mobili e ascensori guasti sono una tortura per anziani o inabili costretti a fare le scale ma anche per bimbi in carrozzina,1
Metro is a inexpensive way to travel as well as the Urban trains.,"Transportation in Portugal was a bit of a problem since we are older and need water closet more often than when we were younger. The metro bathrooms were out of order at every station we stopped. We used the flixbus to go to Evora, the bus station nor the bus had working restrooms. We used the Rossio train station to go to Sintra, which was an organized transport system with a clean water closet.",1
Pre buy is a SCAM,"Metro system itself is efficient and clean.But tickets purchasing and service is a scam. I simply paid and LOST more than EUR 35.
They have a pre purchasing system at THEIR website, that redirects to another portal, afterwards understood that other company, what for me makes no difference at all as they wanted to explain me.
I pre purchased tickets for my arrival, to pick at airport up.
When I went ( and need to queue anyhow, so no benefit), machine showed expired tickets. Staff person was by chance already with me and saw it. Around 30 min and 6 metro staff members discussing and making phone calls and no solution. Just that I needed to reach Metro AND the other company to request reimbursement. So paid again for tickets. Reached in written both companies. From Metro got an automatic email reply telling they would reach me back ( almost a week now and nothing) From the other company NOTHING.
So money lost in a scam.
DON’T use the pre buy. Queue ( and long) at the airport and buy on the machines.
Not honest service and NO replies",1
NO LIFTS WORKING ON THE METRO - DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE DISABLED,Although potentially a good Metro system there were virtually NO lifts working on most of the system when we visited. Only a few stations have escalators and these only serve some of the levels. According to the staff in our hotel the lack of working accessability has been going on for a long time - a useless Metro system even if you are only partially disabled,1
"Please, do not go","I've known Metro and a half for around 40 years (maybe more). It was a nice and intimate bar, a nice place to be with someone you know or friends. I hadn't been there for many years. I went there a few days ago and what a huge disappointment, the Metro and a half has been transformed into a strange thing, between the tavern and who knows what, bar is definitely not the case. Lots of light, huge tables for dining, nothing but absolutely nothing reminds you of the beautiful bar it used to be. A horror",1
Can't find what's shown in the photo,"The metro station I found in that direction, was not as shown in the picture, so picturesque, it was a normal station.",1
"Weak, weak, weak","The space where the minigolf is installed is no more than an old commercial building where the pistes were installed. When we went the day was raining and the space was completely crowded. Therefore, although it is necessary to make a reservation there is no restriction of access. It is difficult in these conditions to play with children restlessly when there are 5 people in front of you on any track and when it is in your turn there are 5 already waiting.
The cherry on the top of the cake was right at the beginning when at the reception we asked for information and the lady didn't even know to speak Portuguese and asked us to speak in English which we obviously refused. We had to wait to call a Brazilian lady who apparently was the only one who spoke Portuguese in that space. Simplesmente lamentável.",2
Bad.,"Completely desolating, nothing to do with the exposed on the site. Bad service to scratch the intimidating to ""almost"" demand the consumption on site. Site with many positive reviews because they offer shots in exchange for the same.",1
Not good.,"found this experience to be underwhelming and not worth the price. Many of the levels felt repetitive and basic, with little variation or creativity. While the Light Room was visually interesting, the overall design of the levels lacked excitement—nothing moved or provided any real challenge.

One of the biggest disappointments was that after completing a round, the ball was taken away, so there was no chance to replay or even attempt a rematch with my partner. It felt like the experience ended too quickly, leaving no opportunity for a bit of fun competition.

Compared to other mini-golf courses I’ve visited, where the stations were unique, challenging, and allowed for multiple rounds, this one fell short. For the price, I expected much more, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend it. Too expensive for what it is.",2
Nothing recommended,"Very expensive for what is offered, confusing, stuffy. I don't recommend it, although there aren't many mini golf options in the city, I don't recommend it at all.",2
Claustrophobic and expensive!,Excessive price. Claustrophobic. Ridiculous. For tourists to see... Nothing extraordinary. 2 adults and 2 children aged 4 and 8 to take a few shots in that environment and drop 50 euros is a lot of work.,2

Too many people to enjoy a piece if the view,"Unfortunately, a large section of the viewing area was obscured by construction at the time I was there, so it's a temporary issue - I hope.
The fully occupied tables and chairs were set up close to the edge, so that standing right by the edge for a moment's view was uncomfortably close.",2
Very average,"Made our way to this viewpoint as we were in the area. The view was ok but I don’t find red roof tiles particularly interesting to look at. A nice view of the castle but that’s sort of it. There’s a few spots to sit and rest however the tour guides and jewellery sellers will approach you. Google maps showed some ‘street art’ located down an alleyway and there was some decent stuff. But mostly it was rubbish graffiti, dog poo on the path and the smell of pee.",2
A crowded viewpoint with not much to see except people watching,"This is a dud if you have been to any of the other miradouros in Lisbon unless you like to see tiled roof tops. But it seems to be a good place to hang out as the grassy slope behind the viewing platform was filled to the brim with people just lying there seemingly enjoying people watching. If you have other more interesting places to explore, this is one place you can safely skip.",2
Mediocre view,"Cute ""balcony"" surrounded by plants and azulejos, but the view is very little. The roofs of the houses and buildings are too close and the Lisbon slit you see DA this area is nothing special",2
Just get out of here....,"This may be one of the most beautiful vantage points in Lisbon, but if this small square is totally crowded.

Very expensive for poor quality,"During a trip to Lisbon in July 2023, I buy each of my daughters a small pearl bracelet for 9-10€ each. After barely 1 week the bracelets break.

Bad Game Masters,"We went to the more complicated room, the game Masters did not help almost anything when we asked for help which led to us not being able to finish the room. The room was very busy but the game masters ended up spoiling. We ended up being frustrated...

We made Prision Robery and there are no clues in the room, there is no connection between them when they exist... we had to ask the Game Master for help and he immediately told us what to do. The Game master was not giving clues and help and natural form throughout the game.... I was waiting for us to ask... much in the room had no logic in the way it was done. I think it was the first escape room where I felt like I was so stupid that it was that room. I won't repeat in this company.",1

Ugly,"After previously purchasing a ticket so that we could enter the disco, they banned the entrance of 3 of our friends who were with us, and allowed all the girls to enter.

A nightmare experience and a total scam,"A Nightmarish Experience: The Infernal Abyss of Club Mome

Stepping into the ghastly confines of Club Mome feels akin to voluntarily plummeting into the abyss of inferno itself. This venue, draped in the facade of jubilation and mirth, morphs into a harrowing phantasmagoria upon entry. From the threshold, one is ensnared within an ambiance saturated with desolation, decay, and despondency.

Let us commence with the ambiance, or the glaring absence thereof. The interiors constitute a grotesque amalgam of garish neon hues, gaudy embellishments, and an auditory assault of discordant melodies, overwhelming the senses akin to an unyielding deluge. The atmosphere is thick with the pungency of inexpensive libations, perspiration, and fragmented aspirations, as though the very walls exude anguish.

The patrons, a motley assemblage of forsaken spirits and societal outcasts, seem plucked from the deepest recesses of human obscurity – their gazes akin to predatory specters lurking in the shadows, bereft of compassion, their motives dubious at best. Indeed, a gallery of degeneracy and debauchery unfurls before one's eyes.

Yet, the most egregious transgression of Club Mome lies in its egregious service, or rather, the dearth thereof. The attendants, if one dares to grace them with such a title, embody a demeanor of surly apathy, incompetence, and an utter disregard for the plight of their clientele. Procuring a libation resembles navigating a labyrinth of ineptitude and indifference, with bartenders more engrossed in frivolous dalliances than tending to the needs of their paying patrons. And as for locating a hygienic lavatory amidst the squalor and filth, one might as well attempt to discern order from chaos.

The libations themselves are a testament to the nadir of human misery. Diluted concoctions served in tarnished vessels, each sip a poignant reminder of the soul-crushing despair that pervades every facet of Club Mome. It is as though hopelessness itself has been distilled into liquid form, proffered to unwitting victims.

And let us refrain from delving into the realm of entertainment, or rather, its lamentable absence. The purported ""performers"" stumble upon the stage akin to somnambulistic apparitions, their movements sluggish, countenances vacant. They appear ensnared within an eternal purgatory of mediocrity, destined to perpetuate banal routines ad infinitum.

In summation, Club Mome stands as a blight upon the very essence of existence. It represents a festering lesion upon the visage of humanity, a testament to all that is amiss within the world. To venture within its cursed confines is to embark upon a journey of remorse, a descent into madness devoid of reprieve. One is well advised to shun it at all costs, lest they too succumb to its inexorable grasp.",1
Bad,"Most idiotic club I have ever been to, over expensive and have bathroom police that barge in when you’re literally on the godamn toilet .

The worst experience in DISCOTES in Lisbon,"The worst nightclub in LISBON. I can't find words to describe the security guards' lack of education. Brutality and bestiality. Talk about respect for the ""other"".
The music is very bad.",1
terrible!,"Bad experience.
I went in alone, shortly after some friends to meet them inside. I entered through a side entrance, due to an agreement with the college. I showed my college card and they didn't give me any card, as it was my first time there and I didn't know anything, I thought that the card that other people had was only used to buy drinks. When I left I saw everyone swiping their card and I went to a security guard to ask what the card was for and he said I didn't have one. They wanted to force me to pay €50 because they said I had lost a card that I never received, they searched my bag and wallet, while I told them they wouldn't find anything because I hadn't received it, I spoke to the management and the security guard who supposedly he was giving cards at the door where I entered, when he saw me he said he had never seen me but when the manager asked him he assured that he had given me a card. LIE!! Another security guard who apparently controls the exits to smoke said that I go in and out several times with a card, I never went out to smoke or even be outside. Once again LIE!!
In short, unfriendly security guards who don't know how to admit mistakes. Unapproachable, rude and incompetent staff.",1
Place to avoid,"At this nightclub they stole my daughter's wallet with CC, bank card, pass, money and other personal cards, as well as the drinks card that is given at the entrance.

Place is too crowed bcoz of hallowing you can beardly move people are pushing each other more over suffocated, and they give us 15 euro card per person even if you used it or not you have to pay for it.

However, the cashier made a mistake and didn't give me the card back. I paid 20 euros, I had the receipt and the proof of debit on my account but the bouncers didn't want me to leave, 20 min waiting inside for them to look at the surveillance cameras so they could tell me there was no problem, the bouncer was violent to get me to leave the club, he was unpleasant. In short, it's a nice club, but the bouncers do a poor job and are disorganized, given that payment is made on the way out, and they don't handle it professionally.",1
Terrible,"Security so rude, tried to detain us for not paying an entry fee that THEY HADNT SPECIFIED don’t go: lower floor was private",1
A porta é minha entra quem eu quiser!,"Péssima impressão. Porteiros mal educados e grosseiros, acham que podem empurrar as pessoas. Queriam nos cobrar 50€ a entrada depois de ficar quase 2h na fila. Ridículos! Para a próxima voltamos com a comunicação social 🤬",1

Not particularly attractive,"The monument is located in the Jardim do Principe Real (so known because this park is part of the neighborhood of the same name) but the real name would be Jardim França Borges; the latter was a journalist strongly committed to the republican cause. The work, created in 1925 by Maximiano Alves, consists of a small stone base with three levels of different thicknesses on which three roughly squared boulders have been stacked, decreasing in size from bottom to top; on the last one rests a further boulder, also roughly roughened which acts as a support for a bronze medallion with the effigy of França Borges; a bronze female figure rests on the pile of boulders, looking towards the effigy of França Borges: she represents the Portuguese Republic in an attitude of gratitude towards the journalist, for what he has done through the press in favor of the Republic. The garden is not large so it is easy to find the monument: in any case it is in a small flowerbed in the center of an open space in the north-eastern corner, in front of the famous Buçaco cedar.",2
Monument of bad taste,"Usually when an artwork is controversial, it does not create a climate of harmony or pleasure for the audience. It is the work in particular, it is of extreme bad taste , uninteresting that does not beautify or awaken in the viewer any empathy (it is the object of scorn satire)",1
It must be interpreted,"Monument that pays homage to all those who have been persecuted for their sexual orientation, created in 2017 by Rui Pereira and located approximately halfway along the eastern side of the Jardim do Principe Real, near the França Borges monument (this site was probably chosen for the installation as the Principe Real neighborhood is now home to a lively LGBT community). Particular work, like almost all modern sculptures, in concrete and iron, made up of two ""doors"" arranged orthogonally: one is empty (there are only the jambs and the concrete architrave) while the other, inside the frame made of concrete, it contains an iron plate on which a male-looking silhouette has been cut out on one side and female on the other. Obviously the monument has its own symbolism, which perhaps not everyone (as happened to us) will be able to grasp; usually this is also a characteristic that modern works often have in common. I only learned the correct ""reading"" (which is not immediately understandable and/or in any case cannot be shared) until later, once I returned home and carried out specific research; At the time it just left me perplexed.",2
Very disappointed,"Tuktuk ride arranged by hotel (cost 220 euros) was unsatisfactory. I am very surprised to see so many highly rated reviews.

The driver Mario was very pleasant and knowledgeable; a lovely man. However, the tuktuk was very difficult to get in and out of (we're quite nimble but this would be a real problem for some people); the ride was unbelievably bumpy resulting in me feeling quite nauseous; but the biggest problem was that we could see hardly anything because of the way the vehicle roof is structured. In order to see anything at all, we had to sit bent double and even then our view was blocked by the low roof.

For a sightseeing tour this is quite unacceptable and not a great way to spend 4 hours!",2
Guide was late/poor communication/never able to go on trip/no refund.,"Our host did not meet us at our location at the start time of 9am, we waited for 20 minutes. I reached out to confirm that we we’re still on, after I didn’t hear back we left. I finally heard from the company that the driver was running late. We were already back at our apartment by then and we asked for a refund. They refused to give us one so we’ve had to contact our credit card company directly to dispute this. We are extremely disappointed. We had two other tours that went really well, the guide was there on time and gave us the experience we expected. Not only were we inconvenienced but the poor customer service is baffling.",1
A must see experience. Experience with the company needs improvement.,"I left a previous review. We were happy with the tour guide. He was friendly, funny and knowledgeable. I mentioned that the visit to the palace and other stops was great as well. I gave a three star rating because we weren’t happy with the amount of time provided at one of the stops due to some confusion around how to enter the Regaila stop after we payed for it. My family and I were very punctual at each stop and did not hold the group up. We actually waited for the other party at two stops. After posting our opinion about the experience I received a direct text message from our tour guide saying I was unfair and didn’t tell the truth. My trip advisor comment received a comment saying I never returned on time which is a complete fabrication. The way they responded to a review they asked me to post twice prompted me to lower my score as I consider this behavior to be part of my experience working with them.",2

Disrespect,"He made me buy a ticket to the Penal Palace and canceled it without even telling me. Tremendous nonsense.

Bad company! I do not recommend!,I was going to take a tour to Sintra and Cascais scheduled for 8am with a meeting point at Praça Marques de Pombal. I got there at 7:50 and the bus had just left without me. Very disrespectful towards the customer! I do not recommend! Email communication is also terrible and lacks a lot of professionalism. LOOK FOR ANOTHER COMPANY IN LISBON!,1
"This was not a tour, it was an expensive ride to 3 cities","I recommend skipping this tour and doing Sintra on your own. There is no actual tour. You pay over 70 dollars for the ride and to hear a sentence about each place visited which I could have received more from an Uber driver.
Overall it was acceptsble. but poor communication from operator. Instructions about purchase of tickets was not clear. The last stop Cascais felt like a bit of a scam to get us to spend money at the restaurants and shops. There is no need to be there for 3 hours. If you are booking this tour, be sure to not only ask questions but get all answers in writing, not all guides follow the correct itenerary. Lastly, ask for a guide with more than a year experience because ours did not know much history of the places we visited.",2
Lousy service to the tourist,"Lousy treatment of us as tourists!!! They were eager to close (before the hour we had been told by the lord of the till)

Lots of queue even if you have a reserved time. Disappointment,"We got the tickets for 12:30 but anyway you wait in line for more than an hour in the sun, or in the rain... whatever.

Not worth a visit/ Not worth IT,"What a scam!! 18€ to visit the cloister and the refectory (which is empty). The building is huge so we think we will see a lot DE things, but the part to visit is very small. It's beautiful, but it's not worth the trip. The church is free but everything under scaffolding, so nothing to see. What a rip-off! 18€ to visit the cloister and the (empty) refectory. The building is huge, so you think you will see lots of it, but in reality you visit a tiny area. IT is beautiful, but is not worth the wait nor the price. The visit of the church itself is free but everything is under scaffolding so there is nothing to see.",1
Total Waste of my Money,"I bought my tickets before I left the uk to visit on holiday. I was sent a “ voucher ticket “ that after spending over an hour queuing in the searing Belém heat, my wife and I were

What a complete and utter waste of my hard earned wages that was.
I have also bought tickets for a Tagus river boat ride tomorrow 31/07/25. After today I am not even confident that we will be allowed on that either.
I know one thing though. I won’t be buying through Trip Advisor again.",1
Impressive building but over-priced,"This is a wonderful building but it is a complete rip-off for the 18 euro ticket price. Literally the tour is the opportunity to walk around the lower and upper levels of the cloister once and exit. There also needs to be much more in terms if information as you progress round.
Best advice is to skip this and go to the church next door for free. Also, much better value is the maritime museum.",2
Long line despite tickets,"All monuments in the world now ES manage to work with timeslots, only here you can queue for 1-2 hours in the blazing sun despite a ticket...
Definitely not contemporary anymore and for 18€ per person you can expect more",1
Disorganised - needs real timed tickets,"We never got into this - it was 38 degrees C heat and the queue looked about 1 hour long, the 2 days we got near to it. Went to the tropical gardens next door, lovely and cheap!",2
Lamentable,"We arrived with our tickets purchased online for the morning slot.
We arrived outside the monastery at 9:10 and there were already two queues.
One for people with tickets the other for people who are part of a group organised by a tour operator.
As soon as the doors opened the groups came back en masse and we continued to wait outside in the heat.
I was able to count about 8 groups of more or less 15 people passing like this, so I dared to ask a lady of the Monastery Service how it was that these people passed by.
I got a rough explanation that the groups had to be them inside and that they had a schedule to follow. She said that to me in an extremely harsh tone and said I didn't have to ask her questions, then she came back talking loudly and saying it had started badly... I guess she was referring to me.
I find this completely unfair to normal customers not going through a tour operator and Service and lamentable. Finally we waited for more than an hour watching the others pass us by.
I don't recognize my country... that it shames",1
Waiting outside in the sun for hours,We are waiting outside with ticket made... for several hours and only the booked enter... kilometer line bad organization,1
Disappointed - Closed due to Labour Strike,"We disappointed that we were not able to visit on June 11 and 12 due to labour strike. Luckily, the tour company that we booked with notified us before hand and fully returned our tickets.",1
Waste of time,"A waste of time totally not worth the wait
Compared to other similar constructions it’s not that impressive and no long queues either",1
Bad experience.,"Too long waiting in line. 2:30 is a long time.
To flee....
Because the rooms are empty and not everything is visitable.
The chapel is under construction
A huge scaffolding blocks the view of the altar too bad.
Anyway, now's not the time.",1
very bad experience - paid full price however only small part was accessible,"very bad experience: we paid 18 Euros per person and only a very tiny part of the Monastery is currently open. Nobody informed us when we bought the tickets at the ticket booth.

muito mao, pagamos 18 Euros per pessoa e so e aberto uma pequena parte do mosteiro; e nenhum nos diz nada a biglieteria.",1
-Suck!,"NO! Like everyone , more than an hour waiting despite tickets booked, no audio guide while he was paid.... disappointing visit and not had the heart to queue again to see the church, in short we buy a postcard and we get out!",1
Disappointing,Waited over an hour in the blistering heat with prepaid tickets. Got in and honestly not much to see. Nice building and architecture but not worth the $25 euros/ticket ‘with self guided audio tour’ which didn’t work anyways. Save your money and enjoy views from the outside.,1
No refunds!,"Horrible long line despite buying tickets online for the next day.

Decided to get a refund. In the official ticket stand they let you scan a QR code that gets you a form to ask a refund.

But don’t get fooled, as per museum policy they don’t refund tickets!!

Honestly, a tourist trap as they are clearly aware of capacity issues and get extra money from tourists that don’t want to spend minimum 2 hours in the sun waiting.

Eventually we went to Sintra and don’t regret it one bit, absolutely must visit when in Lissabon",1
Overrated,"Mosteiro dos Jeronimos

Lisbon

Overrated

1013094270

1* only for the Lisbon Card. Why? We bought it specifically to get into the Jeronimo monastery. When we got there around 10 am, the line was at least 2 hours long. We had to go back 4 times to check the line and eventually got in line at 4.40 pm. We bought the Lisbon Card because the website said SPECIFICALLY that you wouldn't have to queue and would be fast-tracked. What a lie that is. You will stand in line with everyone else. They must have had a lot of complaints yesterday (14 June) as they have changed the wording on the site.

Grossly overrated as well.

The church is free and virtually no queue so you could go in there instead.

Watch out for unofficial sites selling the Lisbon Card as well. It's virtually impossible to tell which it is.

Also, check whether things are open and whether there are strikes planned.",2
Long wait and expensive entrance,Very expensive the whole for what you see. You can see it the same on the Internet. You wait an hour for entry to stay choff,1
Overrated,"Arrived around 12 and a large queue, decided to go for a coffee and come back. Queue half the size but didn't take too long to get in.

Completely overpriced, 5 euros would have been fair.

From the outside you only get to tour around half the building when you are in (ground and first floor). A couple of sparse rooms to visit. Not a lot of information provided when you are inside.

If you come from a new world country where the oldest buildings are perhaps only a hundred years old then you might be impressed otherwise once inside you are faced with a quad so seeing the same view from 4 different sides of the building, go downstairs, see the same, then exit. Take a look at the pictures on line and take a view whether seeing it in real life is worth the 18 euros.",2
"When you see long stressful lines, look for other ways to experience that 'must-do' thing","I'm sure you've read about the looooong line for ticket holders to enter this landmark, and when you get there, your brain has a hard time processing why you even picked an entrance time and prebooked. There was NO way I was spending hours in a hot line of folks with the sun beaming down on me, so I skipped it and entered the church next door instead b/c that line was way shorter and not even sure you needed a ticket to do this! It's where Vasco Da Gama is laid to rest, and the scene is rather moving. With Belem Tower being closed for renovation (sorry folks scaffolding all around the bottom) I guess the monastery is overrun? Next stop, steps away from the church is the famous bakery making the pastel de nata treat and you'll know you're there b/c there are swarms of people waiting in, that's right, another line. But on the side of the building there's a to-go line with like 2 people waiting where you can get the very same thing. All I did was get 2 pastries and a Coke Zero to-go and with my receipt, I flashed it to the hostess who allowed me to enter for the restroom (huge & nice) and I snapped a photo of the inside and left. Ate my treats on a shady park bench across the street. One more tip for your trip out to Belem, to get on the train or to get across the train lines to the other side, you're looking for either an underground walkway basically like entering the NYC subway or a skywalk near an office building...tons of people looked very confused about this. I heard you could go to the top of the statue with all the explorers on it but it looked too scary for me. Have fun!",2
18 euros a shame ...,"What a disappointment... 1 hour waiting in full sun, 18 euros per person for a visit (even if magnificent) so short!!! No visit to the gardens... A shame...",2
No line-cutting! Endless waiting!!!,"There's no way back! Tickets purchased online do not give access to a skip-the-line queue simply because it does not exist! There is only one line and you have to wait an hour to two hours in full sun. Scam. We can't wait with young children. The sale of excessive tickets continues, it’s sad!",1
Not worth it 👎🏼,"The waiting time (1h30 in full sun) harassed by vendors in the saddle, is not worth the little visit.
The cloister is certainly beautiful but not worth this wait especially with tickets taken in advance! And in addition we have to wait another time to visit the church.
Between the price, the waiting etc this monastery is very pretty from the outside!
Run away!",2
Don't bother. Long queue. Little to see.,"After a 30 minute tram ride and an hour and a half in the queue, the short visit to the cloisters just didn't cut it. Yes they are nice cloisters and have a long history, but apart from two empty rooms, that's all you see. Watching people leave they all looked distinctly underwhelmed. The number of visitors inside is limited at any one time, hence the long wait to get in. However on the day we visited they could have let everyone in the queue inside at once and it would have been less crowded than most historical sites. I suspect if it was free immediate entry, no one would bother. There are many better places in Lisbon to spend your time.",1
To flee,"2 hours of queuing in full sun with tickets purchased in advance!!!! The site is far from worth it!!! And you have to start again to visit the church.
To flee!!!",1
Disappointed,"45’ waiting, just for the square. Price should include the church also. Not much explanation. Nice to see but felt like a waste of time. There are better places to go to",2
Don't bother,"Just a gigantic waste of time, not worth the entry fee at all. You can queue up and enter the church for free - do that, it's worth it.

But don't queue in the hot sun nor pay the extortionate entry fee's to wander around two small floors of this Monastry.

We were there for such little time we genuinely thought we'd taken a wrong turn when we ended up at the exit.",1
Terrible…wait is unbearable for a 10 minute walk-through,"Terrible… don’t let the other reviews for you. We had tickets for 10:30 and was told to be there 30 minutes prior, which we did. 2 to 3 hours, ya if you consider waiting over two hours outside and the beating sun when no place to sit. Just to go inside and do pillars and nice architecture for a 10 minute walk. There are much nicer places to see in Lisbon.",1
Not worth it,"Like many other I was horrified by the queue. , the main problem being the large tour groups who got in at the expense of the individual travellers. Whilst the carvings are beautiful there really is not much to see and you then have to queue again for the church. No where to sit and no shade from the sun in the queue. I would not recommend it.",2
Excessive waiting time,"We didn’t see the monument because when we arrived at 10:30, half an hour after they opened the waiting time in the queue it was about 3 hours. Even though we had the tickets bought we had to wait. I think they should indicate that on their website, in most monuments buying tickets in advance makes the wait reasonable and everything is organized. They should also indicate that the minimum you have to wait is two hours, do not indicate on a sign that time when you pass through the door.",1
"Long lines, only two time slots, no benches, no water and no washrooms nearby. If you have a disability forget it","Travelling with my family I was so disappointed. We arrived in the afternoon. The lines were so long. You had to line up for tickets and then join a outrageously long line. It was so disorganized. We came from Ontario, Canada. My daughter has a rare disability and bladder condition. I couldn't have her standing in line forever with no toilet in site. There were no benches for order people to sit while waiting. It was beaming hot. We just walked away. I was so disappointed as it was the one site that I wanted to see while in Lisbon. My husband and I are both 65 and can't stand for hours. Why not book specific time slots? We were able to do this when we visited Sintra. Having only 2 time slots is not sufficient. Subjecting the elderly and individuals to long waits, without washroom facilities, benches or water close by does not take the tourist's experience into consideration.",1
Not worth the time or money,"Our tickets were for 10:00 but we didn’t get admitted until after 11. The stone carving is beautiful but that is all there is to see, really. You can buy an audio tour but that isn’t included in the admission fee",2
Bad trip,"On arrival at the opening, even with an online ticket, there is an hour and a half wait for entry. Inside, another half an hour to use the ladies' toilet. The ticket is 18 euros, the level of service is very poor.",1
Very disappointing,"Very, very disappointing. 1 hour and a half in a row in the rain with no priority for online tickets. Once you enter the bathrooms far away, few and tiny. Of a huge building you see a small part. But the most absurd thing is that after seeing the cloister they let you out in the rain to queue up again to enter the church. Terrible organization. In Barcelona to the sagrada familia with the online ticket you enter at the appointed time and have the guide via free app. So much artistic beauty wasted",1
If you like endless queues!,"I put this note in very disappointed of the endless waiting time to access the monastery (almost 3 hours on the day of our visit).
Included in the Lisboa Card",1
Scam Attraction; Visit to Waste Time,"[TOURISTS PAY ATTENTION] This is a tourist trap; While the Monestaty is pretty, it’s not worth the ticket prices.
1. The line to get into the monastery is extremely disorganized. Even though we had tickets prior to arriving it took 2.5 hours to get into a monetary, which was NOT during busy season.
2. There is literally NOTHING within the monetary. No exhibits, no seating, no signs or guidance. Beware if you’re traveling with kids and elderly.
3. This is a scam, as noted above. There is a separate enterance for the “church”. The church is free of charge (which they don’t advertise) yet if you have tickets to the monetary, you have to wait in a separate like to get into the church. Common sense would simply be to let the people who purchased tickets into the church as well after waiting hours to get into the monetary.
4. There’s a LOT of panhandlers harassing you while you’re in line to the monetary. Beware of pickpocket’s and ticket scams.

I do not recommend this attraction. The hassle with tickets and simply getting into the monastery was not worth it. Especially when there’s nothing to see in the Monastery other than the architecture.",2
Very bad and unprofessional service in ticket office,"We tried to visit the Monastery today. We arrived at the ticket office where we were advised that there is a 2 hrs queue to get inside the Monastery. We asked what is the waiting time to enter the church (next to the Monastery) and we were told is about 20’. We specifically told to the lady who was issuing the tickets that we will go only to the church and she said it is 18 euro per person (we were 4 so the total amount was 72 euro)
Once we entered the church we noticed that no one checked the tickets in the entrance so we were a bit sceptical about the fees. Following our visit, we asked the security at the entrance and he said the church visit is for free. Within 20’ after we have purchased the tickets we went back to the ticket office and explained to the lady that there was a misunderstanding and since we have not used the tickets to enter the Monastery we wanted a refund. She said is not possible and that all the info is available for someone to read and denied her mistake. The whole point is that the ladies in the tickets office speak very poor English and are completely unprofessional. Since this site is visited by thousands of people everyday, the stuff should be in a position to interact with the visitors using professional English in order to avoid similar issues. We are quite sure she did not understand our discussion and got lost in translation. As a minimum, they could have at least refunded the entrance fees.",1
That's bad!,"So where do we start? The monastery highly recommend it because very nice, the cloister for me failed. Or rather rejected the organization. The cloister is suggestive and reminded me a bit of the style of the English cloisters, but let’s say that for what you see the ticket price is definitely high. In addition, I had read that there was a lot of queue and so I had bought tickets online in advance, it was no use! Unlike other places that had separate lines (those who already had a ticket had some sort of priority) we did more than an hour in a row under the sun. I had booked my ticket for 11 and we went in at 12.15. In hindsight I would only visit the monastery.",2
Long queue for a short and useless visit,"There was a long queue and the visit was so short. There are not scheduled visits, no places to seat and enjoy the monastery. I do not recommend it.",1
Ridiculously long queues from early on. Don’t bother unless you like standing around for hours.,"Following advice online we arrived here no more than 30min after opening time. There must have been at least 500 people in the queue to get in. We had a Lisbon Card which allegedly means you can skip the queue. This is not at all true. The only thing you done have to do is go to the ticket office first. You still have to join the hundreds of people in the line, many of whom are on tours from the many coaches which are parked up there. Having seen the size of the queue, we decided against spending hours waiting in the blazing sunshine and took the bus back into the city.",1
Extremely disappointing and too expensive!,"Extremely long wait about 1h30 in the rain, bad organization and unpleasant staff , the architectures are very beautiful, but 18€ to only see the cloister... It's way too expensive.",1
Very poorly organised,Very poorly organized. We waited in line for an hour to finally realize that we had to buy tickets across the road in a park. How can you imagine when you're in line at the other end of the building that you have to buy tickets somewhere else? Extremely disappointed because we had to give up.,1
Do not book in advance!,"We had booked in advance: bad took us! Arrived at 11 am, an hour after the opening, the tail was already 500m and the regulator announced two hours of waiting (in the rain and in the wind)
As long as there is no regulation with time-stamped tickets, the museum administration will be in its pockets selling tickets that cannot be honored by a visit...
Only solution: arrive at 9am, one hour before the opening...",1
Awful experience for older visitors,"Bought tickets online in advice but still had to wait in a line for 45 minutes to get in. No seating outside and no sitting inside. The 30 minute visit was not worth the wait. And the toilets were filthy. On exiting, had to join another line to go into the adjacent church. All the seats were railed off there as well.",1
Disappointing visit,"You think, I bought tickets online for €19,- to get in faster, but that's a wrong assumption. You just have to stand in the (long) queue (we 40 min.).
Once inside you can walk 2 x a monastery tour and after half an hour you are outside again....
We expected much more from this visit. Where's the rest of the monastery? And almost nowhere were there signs with explanations.
This really wasn't worth the visit. It's too bad. And the price is way too much at €19,- pp. You should go to another museum or location.",2
Want your money but don't care what experience you have,"This attraction is badly managed and poorly signposted with visitors frequently getting to the front of the queue to find they needed to queue for tickets first at the kiosk in the park area. Visitors are encouraged to buy tickets online but it is virtually impossible due to a lack of signal. We were charged full price to find that only the cloister is open, the rest is closed for renovations. We also paid extra for the commentary which was very poor and kept cutting out. I recommend the Carmo Convent instead",1
Don't bother - Half the attraction for the full price.,"The ticket office is on the opposite side of the road to the monastery & church. 18€ each. BUT, it's only when you have presented your tickets and get into the building that it says the church is currently closed for restoration. You're not told this at the ticket office and there's no reduction in the price - shocking! The two storey cloisters are certainly quite ornate but when you've seen one you seen them both. There were no ""interpretation boards"" to explain what it's all about. In and out in about 30 minutes and much of that was trying to find the womens' loos. They are not signposted (come in, go right at the bottom of the stair case, then left and left again).
The gents are on the first floor and a little easier to find.
Hardly an ""attraction""",2
Unrewarding,Not really worth it. Paid over 50 Eur as a family and there was nothing to see except the cloister. After a maximum of 30 minutes you are out. Church was closed for construction work,1
Don’t Bother!,"What a waste of time and money. Big line and big price for this attraction. Yet, once you get in, there’s literally nothing to see. We were done in 20 minutes. And the adjacent church was closed for renovation. Don’t do it!!!",1
If you have plenty of time...,"If you have to wait to buy tickets or wait to enter, I would suggest you give it a miss. You only get to see one cloister and a dining hall in exchange for a very long wait time. If you have a Lisboa Card you are not guaranteed preferred entry and may have to join the regular queue, so consider that. Most of the huge site is not for public display. A visit to Mosteiro de Sao Vincente Fora was much better and with the Lisboa Card cost 6 euro, well worth the money. Go there instead if you have limited time.",2
Worth it only very limited,"Far too expensive, totally overrated

An extremely long queue, a 2-storey cloister with admittedly very beautiful stonework. Nevertheless, it is not worth the wait and the entrance fee.",2
Waste of money,"The exterior of the monastery is beautiful
After paying 18 euros, they saw only the patio of the monastery.
Not worth that kind of money.
It took 10 minutes.",2
Too expensive,"A scam. They charge 18€ to enter and all you see is the cloister, there is nothing else. It is nice but not for that price, I would charge an entrance fee of 5€ and it is more than enough.",1
Overpriced,"It's beautiful cloister but definitely not worth 18 euro per person to visit u will be in and out in 20 mins max nothing else to see , save your money and just visit church for free 😊👍",2
not good value,Great history and beautiful architecture but the price is a lot for 30 mins looking g af 1 courtyard! The monastary at monastery of Sao Vicente de Fora is stunning and well worth a look.,1
BEWARE OF THE GUARDS TELLING THAT YOUR TICKET FOR A TOUR IS INVALID,"We purchased a tour from Cool Tours agency and promptly waited for the tour guide to come. Since it was early I asked one of the guards if I am in the right line for the tour group. He looked at my QR code and he said ""Your ticket is invalid and you have been scammed, I suggest that you scan the code here and buy real tickets. There are no guided tours here nor any tour guides from agencies operating"". After hearing this we bought the ticket in the QR code in the line and paid for it since we dont want to be incovenienced. That’s when someone from the tour group line shouted my name for a guided tour! I just said ""I was just told by that person that you are a scam and you don’t exist!"" The tour guide called the Portuguese Heritage Admin to complain. A lady who were suppose to be in authority talked to us and didnt even apologized and protected the guard that there might be misunderstanding on our part regarding tickets. She even told me to not take a photo nor look at that person. She just refrerred us to a bureaucratic QR code again to process our refund that heaven knows if it will be processed or not.

I was told that this is a regular occurrence in this attraction because they discriminate people who are not Portuguese, tour agencies and just lets tourists buy double tickets as retribution for not going through direct tickets. I suggest that the authorities of the Portuguese Tourism put a stop on this scheme or everybody should be informed on the types of tickets that they accept.

Anyways our tour guide is very knowleageable and very considerate, it’s just that the wrong information of the guard put us off an otherwise beautiful adventure.",2
Cloisters overpriced and over rated.,"Ticket office for the cloisters is 100 metres from the entrance so check the que length before buying the 18 euros per person ticket (9 euros if youre over 65).
We visited on a Sunday and the cathedral was closed for visitors and there was no que for the cloisters.
Inside the cloisters there's very little to see except the architecture, a couple of tombs and before you know it, youre back at the place you entered thinking 'is that it, did we miss something ?'. It looks like a massive spectacular building fom the outside and the ticket office posters give the impression of a grande tour but in the end its not.
Maybe the cathedral is worth seeing and thats free when its open, the cloisters however is overpriced and over rated.",2
Total Nepo,"The monastery is completely overrated. One can reach the ground floor and the 1. View floor around the courtyard - for 18 euros per person! That's all there is! Portuguese people come in for free, by the way. The church next to it is free.",1
A disappointment,"With online tickets taken on the official website, paid 18 euros each, we did not enter because of the long queue, it would have taken at least 120 minutes to wait.",1
Beware of tickets (even when bought directly from them),"Timed tickets are a farce. We waited for over two hours just to get in. They had sold tickets for a day when the monument wasn't even open, and when we asked, we were told to line up. Just in case, we asked the guard and she checked the tickets for us (it was a good idea cause the tickets were void). The staff has a terrible attitude overall, and while the place is beautiful, the staff's horrible attitude ruins it all.",2
"Full price, mileage queue and ...closed.for restoration","Endless queue also for ticket holders purchased online on the official website. The visit is limited to the cloister (so it has a much shorter duration and you lose much of the charm of the place). The rest of the structure is under restoration, too bad that this information is not indicated on the site. Don't waste time or money...",1
Closed and unannounced,"We bought tickets in advance, as many other people who stayed out as we did. If they want to give the day off is fine, but if they sold tickets, they had no difficulty warning (because they had the mails) so that people from all over the world would not arrive. Clearly they're worth tourism",1
Not worth it.,"Meh. I don’t recommend paying to go see the cloisters. No information and not much to see. Yes, the courtyard is beautiful but there really isn’t much else (unless you are an architect). We were in and out in 10 minutes. The church is free so save your euros and go see that.",1
Just a box to tick,You buy a time slot and they keep you waiting ages while they let all the just arrived tour groups in ahead of you. Not much info.,1
"Lovely monastery, but the church closed without warning.","The Monastery is excellent, particularly the cloister. The church was closed without warning so we couldn't visit it.",2
In short:,"It is not worth the cost of admission, 12 euros. Inside there is not much to see, a visit that lasts up to 15 min. Beautiful from the outside, inside nothing big. I wouldn't go back, or rather I wouldn't spend to get in",2
Very disappointing indeed !,"Beware their website says that they are open on Mondays !
IT IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS
Very disappointing indeed !
This also applies to the Belem Tower, very irritating !",1
Disappointing waste of time,"This was the most (and only) disappointing site we visited during our 10 days in Portugal. The online booking process is challenging and we never received the email with our tickets (which was its own drama on-site, we ended up buying 2 more tickets). Most importantly, the “timed entry” selections are a joke- no matter what time you arrive, everyone stands in the same gigantic line to enter. Today the wait was 1.5-2hrs. We had heard such wonderful things about the Monastery but no one mentions the visit takes about 10mins max- walk around the stunning arched Cloister, go into 2 empty rooms with beautiful gothic arched ceilings, and that’s it. So, almost 2hr wait with a timed entry ticket for 15mins of actual touring. No brochure, guided tours or audio guide to try to bring what you’re seeing to life. The Castelo Sao Jorge was infinitely more interesting, be sure to take the guided tours of the museum and archaeological sites. The Lisbon Cathedral also has a small but interesting museum upstairs in addition to the beautiful church itself.",2
Avoid unless you have lots of time on your hand,"Please don't waste your money on visiting this place. It looks perfect to spend a half day or so but the fact is this Mosteiro is NOT set up for tourists.
4 of us spent over 60 Euros and booked a time slot the day before we visited at 10.30am.
When we arrived it all looked beautiful and that's where it ended.
On approaching the building and I'm not exaggerating, the queue outside was at least a quarter of a mile long. Hundreds & hundreds of people waiting to get in.
Ah well it was a good thing we booked & paid for our time slot the day before and felt sorry for all these people waiting in the queue.
We walked to the front of the queue and spoke to the official explaining we had booked & paid & had our time slot as evidenced on our phones.who said that the time slots did not matter and we would have to go to the back of the queue. WHAT!!!
After some banter, it was clear we were NOT getting in.
Apparently they let some 300 people in every half hour and since we were now at the back of the queue, we estimated this would mean at least 1.5 hours standing in a queue YES, at least or perhaps longer.
Could things get any worse? YES, after 25 minutes waiting in the queue which didn't move in that time, it started to rain. Right, that's it, we had all had enough & moved on.
This place is clearly NOT set up for the amount of tourists who visit.
The website is misleading with time slots etc.
One other thing which we considered after we had left was that it must have been gridlock when people were inside this building.
Hope this help others from wasting a morning.",1
Don't waste time trying to visit...there are better ways to spend your time in Lisbon,"We bought timed tickets on line, arrived in our allocated time slot, and found there is no separate queue for those who have taken the trouble to book timed tickets. The place is overwhelmed by coachloads of predominantly cruise ship passengers who are ruining the experience for everyone else. The line was several hundred yards long, and scarcely moved in the first 20 minutes we were in it. It was clearly going to take most of the morning just to get in, so we gave up and went to other nearby museums. It's a disgrace that the Patrimonio Cultural responsible for the Mosteiro can't get their act together to organise a proper ticketing/queuing system",1
Very expensive and with queues for what you can visit,"Queues over an hour despite having tickets. You only visit the cloister, which is huge, but contains nothing, a disappointment. We Spaniards have many cloisters and ecclesiastical art much better, without so many queues and at better prices. The tomb of Vasco de Gama is located in the attached church which is freely accessible.",2
Do not do if there is queue,The two hours of queuing under the sun in a row is not worth the visit. Is complete non-organization the expression of Portugal?,1
Total mismanagement,"Your timed, pre purchased ticket is useless as there are a thousand people waiting in line with your time
Or earlier. There is no control whatsoever- if you want to see a bunch of other tourists, buy a ticket- if you want to see a beautiful monument don’t bother - all you see are other people.",1
Not worth the wait or the price,"No sorry. Not worth the wait or the price. All you see is the cloister which is empty. The confessionals are closed off, there is no chapter house. It is separate from the church itself. Absolutely not worth the wait. If you desperately want to go, come close to the last entry time, it only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk around it.",2
Beautiful but not worth the hassle.,"We had the first timed entry ticket of the day but still waited an hour to get in while hundreds of cruise ship tour group went in (Cruise ships seem to ruin everything). Once inside it is very beautiful but there is no signage to explain the history of what you are seeing. There were no Audio guides either. Not sure it’s worth the time investment. The line for the Church was long but moved at a good pace. You will also be constantly harassed by people selling hats, scarves etc. Go to Monastery Vincente da Fora.",2
Falta total de respeito no tratamento ao turista e clinte!,"My experience at Jeronimos Monastery with your partner Headout was extremely unpleasant. We bought the tickets on line in advance in order to avoid long lines, and at the end of the day it was useless.

In the email we received with the booking confirmation, we were informed that the booking time was 10:00 AM, and we were required to get there 15 minutes in advance. We followed the instructions and arrived there at 9:35 AM and for our surprise there was only a huge entrance line, where all visitors with tickets should wait. When we inquired why we have to stay in line as we have already booked the tickets, the answer we received form the security person was that we had to stay in the line and wait to get in. We inquired about the tickets booked, and she had no clue and there was nobody there to provide any information, except a security guard!

This is complete unacceptable. Clients and turists in this case deserve to be respected and to be provided with accurate information about the conditions of the tickets bought.",1
No!!!!,"Almost as beautiful from the outside.
Save your time and money for other things...
12 euros is robbery!!!",2
"Beautiful, but not worth the experience","Amazing architecture, terrible tourist experience, especially if you're a woman.

Even with a timed ticket, even if you arrive early, you will have to queue for over an hour in the blazing sun. No seats, no shade.

Naturally, you'll drink lots of water to stay hydrated, but when inside the men's toilets are right by the entrance - the women's are a whole floor away through the exit! Only three cubicles for hundreds of women visiting, so be prepared to queue again!

It is cooler inside the monastery, but still nowhere to sit, all the benches inside have signs telling you not to sit.

The architecture is beautiful, but it's hard to enjoy with heat exhaustion! In my opinion, really, really not worth it.",1
No monument is worth an hour in a row under the sun,"You book your ticket for a certain time. Some times are sold out. So you think there's a real contingency. You arrive and find an apocalyptic line. At least an hour in the sun with those who want to sell water, glasses and sanctuary-style hats. No monument is worth such a sacrifice. Don't go there.",1
Visit of Belem,"Two hours of queuing for this frankly is not worth it.
The architecture is beautiful , the places are clean.
No explanation, no audio guide.
And after 20 minutes we go out and we have to queue again to visit the church.",2
I wish that I could give zero stars,"The Monastery is fabulous
This score is for the treatment that we received this morning.
We were booked with a superb local company, and began on the first floor of the Monastery. This took around 40 minutes.
When we came downstairs, a very aggressive male security officer ambushed our fabulous guide. He said that we had been too long and would have limited access to.the lower floor.
I worked in secure psychiatry, I have rarely seen such aggression. The security officer was much bigger than our guide, and got well within the normal body space.
The security officer then called for another officer, and then two police officers.
Our guide was firm, but dignified and polite, even when his phone was taken off him and examined.
Our group was escorted from the Monastery by the police. Just incredible. We were all from big British, Canadian and American cities, takes a lot to shock.
I have no idea if there is a time limit, but this was dreadful behaviour and should be investigated.",1
Long queues and expensive,Very long queue for the tickets and then the church. Expensive tickets to then be charged EXTRA for the sacristy! Cloister was good.,2
It's not worth it,"A lack of respect with the vacationer, we bought the ticket in advance on the internet with a scheduled time, we stay 2 hs in line, in the sun, when we enter there is nothing too much, do not indicate the visit, loss of time and money, if you like to stay in line make the visit.",1
Catastrophic,"Catastrophic organization. No queue depending on the slot booked. An hour's line in the sun. Arrived inside, impossible to sit. I don't recommend visiting.",1
Not worth the wait,"We waited 1.5 hours in the brutal sun, with no shade, outside the monastery that took us about 20 minutes to go through. Ambulances had to be called because of people passing out in line. Once inside, there was plenty of space -- easily at least half of the people waiting in line could have been let in with no issue. The security guards and people working the attraction were rude -- they would rush you along (once you were inside) if you were standing for what they deemed to be too long. Yet they had no problem letting you stand in the sun for over an hour. The inside was lovely, but beyond the courtyard there was not much to see. I would skip this attraction, especially during the busy season.",1
A real shame,"A real shame, after waiting more than 2 hours in the sun, one of the 8 tickets that we bought by Headout, and that arrived in the same mail, we were told at the entrance that it had been used 2 days earlier, in the morning, as soon as we had bought them in the afternoon and on top of that we were not even in Lisbon. They would not let us all in, seeing in the evidence that it was their mistake and the tourist portal, the solution; buy a new ticket and if you want to claim for the wrong one. A REAL SHAME!!!! They should have a plan for these cases, which the workers confirmed happens often, and that the client did not pay the duck, such as generating an auxiliary ticket and claiming them to the tourist portal for the one issued twice. REGRETTABLE. Wherever I go I will not advise this monument or the tourist portals these that take advantage of people.",1
The monastery??,"Aiutooooooo.... Arrived in Belem we made the ticket 12 € tried to do it online on the spot, but the line flowed fast enough and we did it there... moreover very deceptive because we believed that the ticket included 3 other attractions and only later we realized that it was just the ticket for the monastery.... we headed to the entrance, but the line to enter was very long.... 2 hours of waiting under the thick sun and then enter and turn it was enough half an hour .. From the outside it is huge and beautiful, but the inside since they make you visit only the cloister has nothing more than the cloisters of the cathedrals that you can find around and for free. Would I recommend it? Even no it's more beautiful from the outside than from the inside",2
Disappointed,"Only the cloister is visited. Other places were visited years ago. Two hours of queuing in the sun, even if you have paid admission and with entrance hours. For the visit, another 20-minute queue. I do not discount the historical and architectural value",1
Poor organization,"Beautiful cloister but bad organization. Despite the skip-the-line ticket bought online on the official site with indicative time, we did two hours in a row under the sun. Once we visited the cloister we could not see the church because we had to make another line just as long.",1
Unfortunate tourist admission,"Terrible queues to enter having the entrance with schedule. Unheard of today, you lousy organization. No more shadows or seats, 1:30 h queue. Dire",1
Ridiculous organization,"Ticket bought online, then you arrive on site and the line for visitors with ticket is KILOMETRIC, under the scorching sun, prey to illegal sellers of water, caps, umbrellas and bracelets. Incomprehensible the non-quota in time slots. Or rather, understandable when you think that tickets, once purchased, are not refundable. Bad experience and zero respect for tourists and visitors.",1
Poor reception of tourists,"TO ENTER THE CHURCH YOU DO NOT NEED A TICKET but nobody says it, leaving the information to questionable interpretations of the bad signage. Everyone complains (and we are talking about thousands of people a day) clashing with very rude staff. The site – a serious problem for all Portuguese monuments – does not work or goes on cumbersomely. You have to queue at the box office, then queue to enter the church and then queue third to enter the cloister and monastery, all under the scorching sun. It would be enough to allow entry to the church to those who bought the ticket after visiting the cloister, thus unifying the line to avoid all these people one of the worst tourist experiences of all time.",1
Deplorable organisation,"Sale of tickets with a time slot that does not correspond to anything, you have to queue in full sun for more than an hour!!!
Thank you the management of the monastery and moreover the staff at the entrance speaks only Portuguese so for the explanations ...
Do not book, the line for the ticket office is short and you can decide according to the conditions of access to the monastery",2
Poor organization,Very bad information about access and/or the possibility of changing dates following the strike on 15 August 2024. Discomfort for queue of 1 hour and a half under the sun and then not being able to enter.,1
A bad experience,"A catastrophic organization, a wait of more than an hour in direct sunlight, an unsympathetic and not attentive staff.
Curiously, when we (finally) manage to get back, there are few people inside. A real joke.",1
Expensive and tail in the sun,"Very nice cloister, definitely to see... in pictures. We are a family of 3 and paid 30€ to see 10 minutes of a cloister that, as beautiful as it is, is not worth the expense and not even the hours of queueing for the entrance.",2
Bad organization,Bad organization. Purchased tickets online with choice of time. No respect of 'time but you enter only after doing 1 hour and a half in a row under the sun. Obscene organization. The photo shows only half the row,1
Buying tickets online doesn't guarantee it's open,"I bought tickets online for entry later the same day from the official ticket site. When I got to the monastery it was closed due to a strike. It was a wasted three hour round trip on a very hot day. A simple sorry would I made things better, but that was too much for the staff who lacked any basic empathy.",1
Disappointed,"Lousy organization. Two and a half hours waiting in a queue, no information whatsoever. At very high temperatures, elderly people, children, no shade, no water... the price in advance of 12 individual euros... no one knows what time you will access! In the end you visit in a quarter of an hour, the cloister and little else. To see the church a new queue and again the same!",1
Total fraud and scam,"Disappointing. A scam. We pay 12 euros per person per ticket by purchasing it two weeks in advance and with check-in time at 10.30. When we arrived it turned out that no matter whether you had the entrance or not, you had to queue huge that went around the monument. Two hours of waiting in the sun. When we enter it turns out that you only have access to see the cloister and nothing else (10 min visit). To see the church you have to go out and queue again. A disgrace. Not worth it at all, cheating, scamming, total scamming.",1
"Disappointed, it's a real scam","We buy tickets two weeks in advance, with check-in time at 10:30. When we arrived, we had a single infinite queue, and an expected wait of 2 hours. After two long hours of waiting in the sun, we managed to enter, and see the cloister and two empty halls that we saw in just 15 minutes. When I asked to see the church, I was informed that another queue had to be queued. Disappointing, it's a scam, lack of organization, lack of empathy, not worth it.",1
2h queue for 15/20 minutes visit,"The best Attraction in the city if you like to queue in full sun... you bought your tickets in advance time stamped passing to enjoy a skip the line?? What nenni! Queue like everyone else ... the timetable on the ticket is strictly pointless!!Certainly the building is beautiful the cloister is very beautiful but there is only that to contemplate... that and 2 large rooms, one with a tomb and the other it was a large refectory ... To say that it is essential maybe if you have time to waste and if you want to enjoy the Lisbon sun in your face. And also take advantage during this waiting loooongue to be alpaulated by the many itinerant merchants who offer you their hardware without attacking you certainly but very insistent. And yes 2 hours to kill you will see them pass and iron... in short do as you want but frankly at 12€ entry it is expensive the minute of visit but super profitable in waiting time!!",1
"Bad Attraction, treat visitors like cattle","More than 2 hours in line in the sun, even with scheduled hours. There's no place to sit in the monastery. Badly educated staff and stressed by the stress of visitors who already arrive annoyed by the ridiculous waiting. Why not arrange the ticket time??? Besides the monastery inside is beautiful, but nothing spectacular. I don't recommend visiting unless you like being mistreated",1
Beautiful place but catastrophic organization,"The place is beautiful but the organization is catastrophic. Despite the tickets taken in advance for a specific time (on the 1st morning) we waited more than an hour to return.
Only the cloister can be visited. Then to visit the church you have to queue again. We've given up.
Yet the place is splendid",2
Do not buy tickets in high season,"Offering tickets without limiting tickets per time slot leads to a situation that is difficult to accept: more than 2 hours waiting, standing in the sun! We could not make this visit and we are not the only ones to have given up!!",1
Visit ruined by too many lines🤔,"We bought tickets online and yet we had to queue for 1 hour and a half under the sun.... and the tickets were non-refundable. The only ""service"" was the illegal sale of water and scarves to protect themselves from the sun. Finally entered the monastery has a beautiful cloister but unfortunately little else to visit... for the church there was another row... impossible.
Too bad because in front of the monastery there was a well-kept garden that perhaps could be used for waiting.",2
Outrageous organisation,"The organization is shameful. After a line of one hour when we had tickets, we visit the monastery and leaving we want to visit the church at 12 o'clock but it is closed because there is a wedding. We return at 3pm, as requested and after waiting 1h30 in full sun with the children, we are told that the church will not reopen. Shame!",1
Endless wait for an express visit 👎,"1h30 waiting under a blazing sun to visit only the cloister, despite buying a time-stamped ticket 🤷‍’️
no bench either in line or inside
Staff with unkind entrance
The highlight: to visit the church you have to wait again in a line about as long as that for the cloister...
Horrible experience. I strongly discourage until access is improved",1
Hieronymites in August,"So disappointed

By 9:00 a.m. on site, there was already an endless queue. So I decided to take tickets on the internet by booking the 11am slot, time to visit belem and the monument of discovery. We arrive at 11am the queue is even bigger and I look for the place to enter with my Reservation....well in fact there are none, the Reservation is useless because it does not avoid the long wait in full sun.
Balance, given the waiting time we couldn't afford to stay. So I have 4 tickets in the baba...
Portugal has changed a lot, I had been there 30 years ago and I had unfortunately loved the overtourism went through and the Portuguese organization did not follow.",1
Lousy organization,"I don't think I've ever encountered such a lousy organization. We buy our tickets through the web with an assigned time, in our case at 11h.
When we arrived at 10.50am we met a queue of hundreds of people. We asked and were told that was the queue we had to do, whatever schedule we had. In the end it took exactly 1h47' to enter with a temperature of over 300C and without a sad shade throughout the wait. As an example, I burned my legs when I didn’t foresee that I should have worn sunscreen as if I had gone to the beach.
In the end, they only let you visit the cloister and, beautiful as it is, it is not worth all the previous suffering. If they do not improve the organization, they will lose the success they currently have.",1
Online tickets but hours in a row under the sun,"Despite buying tickets online you have to queue for hours under the scorching sun to get in. Bad management for a UNESCO heritage site, not recommended.",1
Organisation to be reviewed,"Hours of waiting in plain sunshine to visit 1/10th of the monastery, queue again for the church... the queue closes before the scheduled time, in short the worst experience in Lisbon",2
Deception of the century,"It seems to me the deception of the century, two hours of queuing for 15 min visit, with how big it is and everything you could visit. Of course, it dies of a sunstroke queuing, not a sad tree, or anything for the tourist to protect from the sun, only to catch pasta and the paying tourist to give it.",1
Worst experience! Go there only if you like standing under scorching sun for hours,"There is no point in buying online tickets. They give you a time slot but everyone, even the one without tickets, have to stand in a long queue for hours. Worst tourist experience ever!",1
Bad organization!,"We had bought tickets online for entry from 11 to 11.30. When we got there, a kilometer line was waiting for us that ran all along the monastery! And we had to queue...hours in a row under the scorching August sun!! Absurd!!!!!! For many places now there are hourly tickets online but everyone makes sure that you can enter more or less at the scheduled time! Really bad organization!",1
Extrem bad entry conditions,"Catastrophic entry situation. Extrem long lines. Bad organisation. Peopel have to stay hours and hours in line under full sun.
Do not go there.",1
UNACCEPTABLE!,"The worst organization ever! In a line, in the sun for over an hour with TIMED TICKETS!! In 2024 this is unacceptable! Is there any consumer association in Portugal that can act against this??",1
Not Worth It,"Not sure what all the hype is about. Even though we had timed tickets, we stood in line for over an hour in the baking heat just to get into the monastery. Once in, you realize you're only seeing about 5% of what you see on the outside. That small section you do get to see is basically a stone walled courtyard with a lame fountain in the middle of it. The church next to the monastery is free but not much there either. Save yourself time and money and skip this overhyped venue.",2
Good from far & far from good,"After 2 hours of chaos in the sun with our e-ticket we only were allowed to see the central inner place 2 levels high. The library nor the garden were open for a visit. What a scam.
I would recommend to visit the Marina Museum: cheaper, with real e-ticket service and you see much more of the monastery & garden.",1
Pay attention to the ticket office in front of the monastery.,"We were scammed by the ticket office in front of the monastery. It is the official one, he made us make the tickets paid 24 € knowing that it was not possible to enter at that time for an ongoing religious service. The bishop gave instructions not to let visitors in anymore. They knew, and they sold us tickets anyway. When we asked for the money back after still standing in line for hours, only to find out that no one would come in, they told us to write an email for the refund. The refund never came. Nobody ever answered. On the receipt there is no name of the ticket office to recall them. They're gone. Not only could we not see the monastery but we did not get our money back.
Don't go to that ticket office.

We were scammed by the ticket office in front of the monastery. It is the one deemed official, he made us pay €24 for tickets knowing that it was not possible to enter at that moment due to a religious function in progress. The bishop gave instructions not to allow visitors anymore. They knew this and sold us tickets anyway. When we asked for the money back after having stood in line for hours anyway, only to discover that no one would come in, they told us to write an email for a refund. The refund never arrived. Nobody ever responded. There is no name of the ticket office on the receipt to call them back. They disappeared. Not only did we not get to see the monastery but we didn't get our money back.
Don't go to that ticket office.",1
"Beautiful place, bad organization","Bad experience, bought tickets for a time and we are lined up regardless of the time, under the sun at 40 degrees. We discover that the church is not accessible from the monastery and another queue must be queued. Too bad because the place is beautiful, bad organization. Portugal is definitely not able to handle large numbers of tourists, queues everywhere despite asking to buy tickets at a fixed time.",1
Overly crowded and long lines,"Head Out sold us tickets as “skip the line”; however, everyone has to stand in the same long line to get in, even if you have a ticket purchased ahead of time, and it is a ridiculously long line with more than 100 people when we went. Ultimately Head Out agreed to refund the tickets we purchased. The place itself is very nice to see from the outside. Unfortunately we did not make it inside due to the ridiculously long line in the scotching heat. It just ruins the experience.",2
Ticket sales despite closed monastery,"The monastery and church were closed, which was pointed out very harshly at the entrance, and had sold tickets for that day online on his own homepage the same day.",1
Unpleasant treatment,"We started with the ugly treatment given to us by a lady who sold the tickets telling us that she no longer sold the tickets by the hour, to look on the web if such, when it was still 1 1/2 hours or more before closing, all this told us in a tone of not wanting to help and not even looking into the eyes. Obviously we got the ticket on the web, no thanks to that lady who after getting the tickets that hinted that they weren't going to let us in... After coming in and being inside seeing him, an hour before the monastery closed according to his schedule we were being kicked out of there. Anyway, the worst treatment I've ever received.",1
Visit of the mosteiro dos jeronimos,Beautiful but!!!! Despite a ticket reserved for 10h organization of me...e with 1h queue for the visit of the cloister then still have to queue again for the church!!! Too bad it's not much to mention the bad mood of the staff,2
"This place is a disrespect of visitors, tourism at its worst","Don't do this with kids, teens that you try to get motivated for history and culture, or if you are not capable of standing up in a line in 30 degrees heat for an hour or more - and THEN go around and enjoy a building.
After the gruesome waiting in line outside there is nowhere to sit and rest a bit when you finally get in. There are a lot of seats but they all have signs saying you are not allowed to sit. If you sit on the ground or a doorstep the guards will be there quickly to make you get up.
The worst is that only a small fraction if the building is open for you to see. It is not worth the wait and the money.
Other reviewers say that you get in for ""free"" with the Lisbon Card. Oh yes, but the Lisbon Card is expensive in itself. And a pre payed ticket will not allow you to ""skip the line"", as several teavel bloggers state. The truth is that you only get to skip the ""ticket line"", but not the hour long ""entrance line"". And then I haven't even mentioned the third line they have: the ""church line"".",1
Horrible experience even buying tickets in advance. Do not go there!!! Disrespectful for elderly and children.,Horrible day in Jerónimos. Disrespectful for children and elderly even buying tickets in advance you face a 3 hour wait,1
Skip and do something else,"Bought tickets for 13:00 time slot. Arrived at 12 and waited an hour (at least) in long line. There didn’t seem to be any reason for the time slot. It seemed that they only allow so many people in at a time as there were not that many people inside compared to outside waiting. But they didn’t pay attention to the ticket times upon entering.

The architecture is beautiful, but there isn’t much to see. It’s empty with the exception of a tomb. You are able to see the 2 floors that are in a square, a courtyard and a few empty rooms (1-2).

Definitely not worth the time spent waiting. Save your time and take pics of outside, unless you are very interested in architecture. I went with my 2 older teens and it was not something they cared to see. Definitely skip for younger children. It would be very boring for them.

We were also harassed the entire time we were in line by people selling stuff. There’s no where to escape so we ended up just ignoring them.",2
Run away,"Believe the reviews. Absolutely horrific. With a ticket waited 90 minutes at opening to get in. Woman working the front is vile, cruel, and an insult to hospitality workers everywhere. Never met someone so nasty, fire immediately. Avoid this place at all costs.",1
Scam!,"Skip this scam!! Seriously—we showed up, went through the hassle of buying tickets using the QR website which was horrible only to find ourselves staring back at a sign saying they closed early for a strike! Save yourself the headache and visit Batalha or Alcobaca, they are way more impressive anyways!!",1
a scam,Real garbage and a scam. The sign at the entrance says last pass at 5:30 p.m. We arrived at 5:10 p.m. and they told us that they had already closed. Disappointing.,1
Complete disorganization,"A profound lack of respect for customers. Even though we purchased tickets in advance, with a scheduled time, and arrived almost an hour in advance, we spent two hours in line, under the scorching Lisbon summer sun.",1
GREAT DISLIKE,"The misadventures associated with our visit to the monastery are associated with the inability to organize and the simple DISRESPECT of Portugal for tourists who contribute a lot of money to the treasury of this country. Complete inability/unwillingness to properly/competently organize the entry process so that people do not stand for HOURS under the scorching sun. I don’t think that, if desired, it is impossible to at least put up canopies and benches so that people can comfortably stand in a kilometer-long line to the monastery and church, which the organizers specially create for unknown reasons. We paid 12 euros for a ticket and waited for almost 2 hours under the scorching sun just to enter the monastery courtyard and walk for about 15 minutes, since there was simply nothing to do there. Entry is only allowed to the courtyard. You won't see anything else. Moreover, you won’t even be able to sit down to rest, since all the steps and stone benches have boards with the inscription DO NOT SIT. That is, centuries-old natural stones that have survived storms and earthquakes can deteriorate if 80-year-old women sit on them
who waited in line for 2 hours? And after the monastery you have to wait the same amount of time to enter the church, the entrance to which is supposedly free. The management of the establishment is hooligans and dishonest people. GREAT DISLIKE. NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
A scam for tourists,"What they have put together is a joke, the entrance fee is €12 to see just one cloister.
On top of that, it is very poorly organized, even if you have an online ticket or, in my case, the Lisbon Card, you have to wait in the same line to enter as the people who get the ticket immediately.
If you're lucky, depending on the time, you'll wait an hour in line, if not two hours, no one will take it away from you.
It was a total disappointment what you pay for what you see.
Don't go, invest that time in another better place.",1
"Worth your money, not your time","I will say this about the monastery, it was worth the admission price, but not at all worth your time. We had purchased the earliest time slot at 9:30, but did not get in till almost 11. For an 1 1/2 hours in line you will see a single courtyard and 3 rooms. It is very beautiful inside but there is so much hype around it that the wait makes it not worth your time. You are better off going to other places for the same amount of beauty. If you do want to go, do it through a tour group. They all got priority entry and see both the church and monastery. That was one big reason the line takes forever, they also wait for those huge groups to exit before admitting the smaller groups. I promise if you go outside a tour group you will regret it. You can see similarly beautiful places in Lisbon with a fraction of time spent.",2
Tourist trap,"Unfortunately, I cannot tell you what I thought of the visit because I was not able to go... We had reserved our tickets in advance on the internet with an additional cost of €0.60 per ticket, we are arrived on site on Tuesday June 4 at 10:30 a.m. the queue was already the length of the monastery... We asked where we should go when we already had our ticket to a security agent, who informed us that it would be necessary queue like the others, that is to say several hours in full sun at 28°C, for a 15-minute visit to the monastery. For us it's no, we were only in Lisbon for two days, out of the question of waiting hours for a visit of a few minutes. It's up to you to form your own opinion but for me it's a nice tourist trap.",1
Terrible!!,"RUDE, UNDISPONENT AND ARROGANT ticket office staff. Including the police. INFOPOINT completely useless. they only steal your salary.",1
Not a great experience.,Not a great experience. We bought tickets online with a half an hour time slot. We got there ten minutes before and were directed to the back of a very long queue - all of whom had pre-booked tickets. Stood for over an hour in very hot weather with no seating. We went into the monastery which was stunning but we were so hot and bothered we had a quick look before heading to the church which is part of the same complex. When we got there we could not believe we were directed outside to queue AGAIN to get into the church. I reckon it would have take us the best part of an hour to get into the church so we didn’t bother. A right shambles!,2
A shame!! There is no point in buying tickets with a specific time. A scam.,"A shame!! We bought the tickets online at a specific time and it was of no use, we had to wait in an endless queue with unbearable heat. It is outrageous that they sell tickets for a specific time that is not even close. After waiting for almost an hour and making no progress, we barely had to leave. There was not even staff available to solve the issue. We claimed the amount of the tickets by email without even deigning to respond.
I do not doubt the beauty of the monastery (we had already visited it a few years before) but that does not justify the poor organization and mistreatment of visitors.",1
Bad organization,"I had a reservation for 10am, arrived at nine we found an arrogant external guard who wouldn't let us in for the time

IT MAKES NO SENSE TO LEAVE HIM A 120 EURO TIP SINCE THERE WERE 8 OF US",1
"Terrible planning to enter, hours in line to visit the patio alone","A place that is not worth entering because of the long lines that form and the little that is visible, the patio on the ground and upper floors, an empty room and another with a tomb, and that's it, stretching it out for 30 minutes. We went in May, and we spent about an hour and a half in full sun waiting to enter, very bad planning. The best thing, and it is free, is the line at the church, with much less people and much more beautiful",1
Needs Proper Facilities for those waiting hours,"We arrived at 10.30 on Tues. The queue was hundreds long. Masses of tour groups. It was 37 degrees and there is no shade, toilets in a nearby cafe, those in the park locked. Older folks and kiddies no place to sit. Given the money this rakes in something better needs to be provided. I am sure it is lovely but we left as no way is it worth the wait for us in that heat and its only May....btw a certain search engine has stopped accepting negative reviews for it, says it all really.",1
No tickets via the internet,"Bought tickets with a time slot via the internet. We were able to stand at the back of the Lisboa tickets. We have about 150 people in front of us. People are being admitted gradually. Advice not to buy tickets online with a time slot.

Misleading...scams...there is no way to get in without being in a huge queue...even with a ticket purchased online.,A little shame. Even if we buy tickets online we still have to go to the entrance queue and the queue to enter is huge in the sun or in the rain. It's a lie when tour operators and supposed guides sell the tour as skip the line...Skip the line. This does not exist in Portugal. They should be prosecuted for deceiving people.,1
SKIP the cloisters visit - it is seriously overrated,"The single most overrated attraction in Lisbon. It costs 12€ per person to go inside and 1-3 hour queues. Not even close to worth it for what’s actually inside. My advice: see the outside - it’s free and most important no queue. If you want, visit the church (queue on right). It’s also free and a much shorter queue. Save your €€ and time and SKIP the cloisters (queue on left).",1
You’re not missing much by not coming here !,"Queued for 30 mins plus. You really see only a small part of the monastery - Chapel/burial chamber, refectory and cloister. You come out & have to queue again to into the church. Limited information about the place, but the stone carving is incredible. Takes only 20-30 minutes. Waste of money and time.",2
Jeronimos Monastery: Vastly Overrated,"The exterior is really quite beautiful. The interior, while also interesting (and even beautiful), but wasn’t worth the price of admission, much less the two hours and five minutes I had to stand in line just to get in—and that was after buying tickets online in advance. Very disappointing.",1
HEADOUT is a scam - don’t use them.,"DO NOT BOOK A TOUR HERE WITH HEADOUT
We booked “skip the line tickets” with a guide for the monestary and tower. We spent e€20 to get here, waited around for almost an hour. When no one showed, we called and were told the tour was canceled. No notification, nothing. It’s a scam. They take your money, and the refund doesn’t come for a week. Don’t do it.",1
Two perspectives,"You have to look at it from two perspectives. The building is gigantic and more than worth seeing, but we were there half an hour before it opened and waited patiently for 1.5 hours in the blazing sun. After that we couldn't go into the church because we would have had to queue again in the other line because of the heat. The toilets are a disgrace. You can't go there urgently, they are cramped, dirty and... groups are given priority, so each individual pays more. Oh, and then there is a Lisboa card where you are still asked to pay. It seems to me that they can't get enough. It's a shame that there aren't other solutions.",2
"Long lines, could not even see the whole attraction!","Long story short, the line was so long that we couldn't see most of this attraction. Rude staff. Here's what happened:

The Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon opens at 9:30 AM. We arrived right before 9:30 AM and there was already a long line. That's ok - we got in line. A worker there asked us if we were with a tour group and we said no. He said we had to get out of this line and go into a different line. We were confused but we said ok and got into the other line. By now, it was later, so that line was even longer. We waited in line for over 1 hour despite getting there right when it opened. We also got tickets beforehand but it didn't matter.

They let us into the cloister but not the church. When we left the cloister we discovered there is no way to get into the church which is the main part of this attraction! We talked to a security guard and asked how to get inside. He said we had to go BACK into the line we were originally in - the line that the other man told us to get out of. It was so disorganized. At this point, the line was so long, that we would have been waiting 2 or 3 hours just to see the rest of it, if we got into that line.

I don't understand why they have 2 lines in the first place - shouldn't you just wait in line and see everything once inside? We ended up just leaving because we didn't want to stand in direct sunlight for 2-3 hours. So we paid all this money and we were not even able to see the majority of this attraction.",1
Lack of respect for visitors,"We were so looking forward to visiting Mosteiro dos Jeronimos but after waiting an hour in full sun, finally getting in to discover we would later have to exit then join another queue to visit the church we were so disappointed. You queue on the left for the cloisters and the right for the church. When you get into the Cloister area which you pay extra for, every seat has signs saying do not sit down, the cloisters are surrounded by stone seating, this seems so ridiculous, after the long wait, a short sit down would have been nice! We abandoned the other queue and called it a day. There is no signposting and many people had queued for ages only to discover you have to buy tickets across the road.",1
Terrible entry management,"Even though we had bought the tickets online days before, once we arrived we discovered that we had to stand in not one but two endless queues, which would have made us waste hours (under a scorching sun). Unfortunately we decided to leave due to the terrible organization!",1
Very expensive for what it is...NOT RECOMMENDED!,"Reading people's comments we have read that the organization was regrettable but that it was worth going to see it. We decided to buy the ticket for €12 and after waiting an hour and a quarter (at lunchtime, since we went first thing in the morning and there were many more people) the duration of the visit is approximately 20 minutes. 20 minutes in which you see a simple two-story patio (nice to take two photos) and a couple of empty rooms.
NOT WORTH IT!!!",1
Long queues,"Didn’t go in, too busy. There is no point going if you are just ticking the box unless you really interested in it art. Crazy queues",1
Jeronimo Monastery,"Seen from the outside, magnificent, an organization to be reviewed, don't take the wrong queue because otherwise, it's back to the queue. Paid 20 euros to see not much, don't waste your time, the photo of the exterior is free and is more than enough.",1
Don't bother,"The place is beautiful but not even close to worth having to wait 3 hours to get into and you couldn't really tell why the line moved so slow but you will literally waste a half of a day of your precious time here waiting to get in, don't bother.",1
Never got in,"We bought tickets in advance for a timed entry but when we showed up 30 min before our time the line was so long it was simply not possible to comprehend. The line was perhaps 1500 people long. The guide we talked to said she had never seen a line this long, ever. And this was just a Thursday morning. We waited 90 min, the line moved maybe 50 feet and by that estimate we would wait another 4 hours. We gave up and left. No refunds!",1
Nice but terrible organization - 3 hours in line,"Beautiful cloister but terrible organization. Slot tickets not considered. 3 hours in line to enter (only in the cloister). You can see it inside in 10 minutes and it could accommodate double the number of people, reducing the queue. To enter the church (for which you paid the ticket) you have to go out and queue again. Organization completely to be reviewed.",1
Not worth it.,"The monastery is magnificent, no doubt about it.

BUT everything else needs to be reviewed.

Time-stamped tickets are futile because you have to queue with others. The Lisboa Card allows you to avoid queuing at the ticket office but you also have to queue with others.

And what a tail! Expect a 2-hour queue if you don't come 30 minutes before opening.

And that’s not the worst (nothing is wrong)! Groups come before everyone else. There is only one person to validate tickets. And once inside, no information. We are left to our own devices. So we spend 30 minutes there not understanding anything of what we see.

Honestly, if we had known all this before, we wouldn't have done it.

And the church? It is certainly free but the queue is not short and even when leaving the monastery you have to queue again. In short, we went on our way to the church.

Don't waste your time and money here.",1
Nice but poorly organised,"A small disappointment, the monastery is beautiful, impeccably maintained but to access the church you have to queue for another very long time, 1 and a half hours of queuing to see the monastery and then another queue of at least 1 hour",2
Timed entry? Who cares??,"What a zoo! I don’t like me to write negative reviews but this experience was not good. In spite of paying for timed entry, there was no consideration for trying to plan ahead. The line went forever- maybe 500 people in line on a Tuesday morning. Didn’t even get in to see the interior. I guess the way to go is by a guided tour. What a disappointment.",2
DON'T GO. DON'T WASTE 3 HOURS OF YOUR TIME. IT'S NOT WORTH IT,"DO NOT GO. I REPEAT DO NOT GO
The organization must be one of the most regrettable in Europe. The time of online entry is worthless. Everyone is in the same line.
There are 2 lines, one for tours and the other for individuals. But YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHICH IS WHICH. NO ONE INFORMS ANYTHING. Apart from that, the guards are very annoying. Zero kindness to tourists.
After the epic you manage to enter and at the end it is a large patio that in countries like Italy, Scotland, England, Spain, Germany, Hungary, etc. would pass as just another one.
It's a scam. One of the worst things I've seen in europq. DON'T GO. I'LL THANK YOU",1
Go on your way!!,"Arriving at 9:30 a.m. we asked a guide where to queue: he showed us a queue (the one on the right) where we began to wait. We approach the door around 10:30 a.m., a 1 hour wait for the person at the entrance to tell us that the line we are in is that of groups (several people behind us in the same situation) and asks us to go queue again in the second line (on the left) where there are already a hundred people!!!! The staff doesn't want to hear anything and doesn't let us pass (us + the few people behind us who, like us, waited 1 hour). Our tickets having already been purchased, we still decided to wait in line in the left lane. We returned around 12:15 p.m., a total wait of 2:30 to 2:45 hours with tickets purchased in advance on the internet... The visit is very quick (30 min) and is not at all worth the 2:30 hours of waiting. The height of the visit: you have to queue again to enter the Church (the one on the right which strangely is no longer that of the groups?!). Unfriendly staff and giving incorrect information. A word of advice: move on, there are much more beautiful places in Lisbon.",1
If you like queues!!!!!,"Reservation made on the official website, online ticket for 10 a.m., arrival on site at 9:15 a.m., already more than 100 meters in line, while the monument opens at 9:30 a.m. and the site indicates that they sell 300 tickets every half hour? ?? We returned at 11:00 a.m. after the groups, and don't think about visiting the church because you will have to queue again, the organization needs to be completely reviewed, a shame because the cloister is magnificent",2
Lousy organization!!,"Catastrophic organization: all groups have priority and pass in front of the poor tourists who wait for hours in the sun without the possibility of sitting down. Lots of coaches and cruise ships arrive after you and you in front!!
Arrived 50 minutes before opening and spent 1/2 hour after opening behind 500 cruise tourists 😤😡
Simply SHAMEFUL!!",1
Splendid example of supertourism,"We bought tickets online and arrived at the opening. Nonetheless we were in queue for an hour. When we entered the queue had quadrupled in size. Inside there is a beautiful cloister and a beautiful refectory, for a total of 2 rooms. Once out we had to visit the church, the third room included in the ticket, but in the meantime the hour-long queue had moved to the entrance of the church, so we left. The next day we went to the less known Sao Vicente de Fora monastery: ten times bigger, ten times more beautiful, zero queues. Here is the difference between tourism and overtourism.",1
CAUTION - Be aware before planning to visit,"This place is shockingly very unorganised so be prepared to buy a ticket but not actually go inside, whether you pre-book or not. Don't be fooled by ""Timeslots"" either they are meaningless you will join the humongous queue and wait for a MINIMUM 1 HOUR with everybody else whether they have a timeslot or not. On the side of the Monastry there are signs saying ticket office but then another sign which makes you realise there is a booth across the road which is the ticket office, this also has a queue. Do NOT be fooled by them telling everyone it will be a 20 minute wait, once you see the queue over the road you will realise that is impossible. I think the only way you may have a short wait would be to have pre-booked slot and be the first in the queue when they open or go before they close but then you may not have enough time in there. The guy at the ticket booth who served us (dark hair and beard) was very rude to everyone, not a good first impression for a monastry visit. After buying the tickets and making our way to the end of the L-O-N-G queue we quickly realised it was hopeless and we had wasted our money. We wanted to ask (longshot I know) for a refund but the queue was long at the ticket office and there were others up there coming back for refunds so we didn't want to waste more of our precious time and didn't bother. It would have been unlikely anyway as the guy was not customer friendly. All was not lost as we gave our tickets away so hopefully some good came out of this, if they eventually got in. We asked if we could use these the next day but this was refused. If you decide to go here I would suggest if more than one of you, one join the queue at the monastry and the other go for the tickets. It was interesting to see a Police presence around the ticket office, makes you wonder if a lot of unhappy people go back there having been misled at how long the wait is?",1
Not worth the money and time,"After standing in line for 1.5 hours, you are back outside in 15 minutes.
You only visit the courtyard behind the church. You don't see anything of the monastery.
So it really wasn't worth it",2
Don't bother. You will queue for 3 hours even if you pre-purchase a ticket. Not worth it. They need to organise bookings into ti,You will be queuing for 3 hours no matter if you pre-purchase a ticket or not. Very unclear signage for the lines. No time slots booking to limit queuing. Terrible organisation.,1
Complete waste of money! Do not pay for cloisters!,"The Monastery was a total disappointment and a complete rip off of €12 to visit the cloisters. You purchase a time entry but the time literally means nothing. I had a timed slot for 11:30, but when I got to the line at 11:15, the guards said it didn’t matter what time my ticket said. They just point you to the end of a long line. The line took 1 hour to enter the cloisters. The cloisters take just 15 minutes to get through and there are very few descriptive signs to tell you more about what you’re seeing. They really need to add an audio guide, more signs, or a museum component. Absolute waste of your time and money! Instead, just go the church for free.",1
BE WARNED OF INSANE LINE UPS OF 2 - 3 HOURS! TIQETS ARE SCAM ARTISTS,"We purchased tickets through Tiqets (MISTAKE). There was no disclaimer about how many tickets they sell per day or to how long the queues could be. Normally when one purchases tickets for a venue they are given priority access or a time to queue.

We arrived in the rain and the line up was absolutely unbelievable - so much so we asked the security guard how long would the wait be and he stated 2-3 hours and when we asked if there was a time of day that would be better he stated that it’s always like this.

Needless to say that I could not physically stand for 2-3 hours, in the rain.
I explained my story to Tiqets and they basically told me that they would never offer a refund.

So beware of this venue. I’d probably suggest to arrive prior to opening.",1
A shameful wonder,"The cloister is truly spectacular but the organization is terrible! The Lisboa card turned out to be decidedly useless as it does not give access priority and we had to queue for 1 hour to enter (I therefore advise against purchasing it). To visit the church you have to queue again for the same duration. I don't understand the limited entry as the cloister is very large and could have accommodated more people. The staff is very rude and the signs for access are non-existent. If we think that it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we are astonished.",1
Entry system is awful,"Currently waiting in the rain in the queue to enter the monastery. We have waited over an hour and looks like at least half an hour more. We bought tickets on line. No system to control the number of people who arrive. A simple booking and timed slot system would solve this issue. I hope it’s worth the wait when we get in, there is a similar queue for the church.",1
Make sure you check the length of the queue before buying tickets,"Buying tickets is a weird set up. Normally you would buy tickets for a museum, church etc. at the entrance to the building. Here you have to buy tickets across the road in a booth type place. From here it is impossible to see the length of the queue to get into the monastery. Today, having queued up to buy our tickets (incidentally from a very rude employee), we were told the queue was 20 minutes long to get in. However, when we crossed the road, the queue literally went on forever and having watched the small number of people who were allowed in at any one time, we calculated that the wait time would be at least 1-2 hours. This is a total rip off. A simple board stating an accurate waiting time would help people decided whether they were prepared to queue for this amount of time. We chose not to, as it was far too long for an elderly person to stand in a queue. We gave our tickets away. Such a shame as we were all looking forward to see it. My advice is check the wait time before buying your tickets.",1
Beautiful but terrible organization,"The monastery is wonderful but unfortunately I have to leave a terrible review because after the visit to the monastery...we wanted to get back in line to see the church as there are 2 divided entrances but it was closed for a religious function i.e. a wedding.... the sign it didn't say the reopening time... lots of people waiting without any information... they then tell us that it reopens at 2pm but it's already 2.20pm and no one can be seen.
How is it possible to allow a wedding on an opening day with such a turnout when Monday is closed!!!
It is neither commentable nor tolerable!",2
A rip-off,"Not even one star for me. A ticket for 12€ and a long queue, what's the point??? The building is beautiful from the outside but all the rooms are closed. I think they want us to pay the renovation costs.",1
Very underwhelming!,"Underwhelming! Long queue basically just see a courtyard for 10 mins. Nothing really to see inside, no information and you're restricted to a very small area of the overall Monastery. Most interesting part of the visit was watching the grumpy security guards answering the same dumb questions from tourists who don't understand how to buy a ticket or join a queue!",2
"Fantastic architectural wonder, but worth the wait and price?","Jeronimos Monastery in itself is a beautiful and detailed monastery. However, there were a lot that I didn't like as much. First of all queue. I was a bit shocked by the line that was already there. So once waiting, it basically went quickly. Still waited 45 minutes. So expectations are high. Once inside you don't see much other than the monastery itself. All doors, windows and rooms are locked. So you don't see much. I at least expected some information boards and some old photos. This meant I was looking forward to half an hour. There were 2 rooms open. A tomb and another room. Finally, traveling by public transport from the center of Lisbon to Jeronimos is easy. Many possibilities. If you like Architecture Jeronimos is fantastic, but going inside is not worth the wait and price. Then looking from the outside is sufficient.",2
"A rain program, not in the rain","The weather forecast was unmistakable. A rainy day. A day, no doubt, for the museums. A day for the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos. It wasn't easy to even get there because many visitors thought the same. It was cold, but the wonder of this world heritage site kept us entertained. A tourist must. A building of unique beauty and uniqueness. A masterpiece of Manueline architecture. But the constant rain had consequences. Shortly before the end of our visit, we were simply thrown out. And that wasn't enough, we weren't allowed into the Basilica of S.Maria de Belem at all. The emergency service was laughable. We didn't get our tickets refunded or offered an alternative date. Get out!! Don't get in!! The devil take you, admirers of beauty and uniqueness.
Gherardino",2
Very underwhelmed,"When you see the queues you think that this is really worth seeing as the architecture on the outside looks great. After paying €12 each to wander round a few rooms and the cloister we were underwhelmed and felt that the entry fee was over the top. The church was good, but not worth the money.",2
Rather underwhelming compared to other attractions in the area,"Definitely over rated! Went to see this place after reading reviews and wish I hadn’t bothered. Queued for ages for tickets whilst at the same time managed to buy on line, however these tickets then took an age to come through via email. Eventually got in and although the place is impressive, felt there wasn’t really much to see compared to other places we have visited in and around Lisbon. If you dont have much time in Lisbon, there are better things to see, for example the Castle, the Carmo Convent or even a trip to Sintra",2
Beautiful but Disappointing,"Visited 18 Jan 2024. 12 euros each to enter but unfortunately the only part one gets to see is the internal cloisters. No access to the confessionals or living quarters etc. Very little info explaining life over the years in the monastery and the staff were keen to walk away when approached. A truly beautiful building that is worth visiting but it doesn’t take long to walk around (15 mins even when reading the few info plaques) and tbh 12 euro’s is a con, especially given the ridiculous queues just to get tickets during the busier times. The church next door is free where the architecture is stunning. All in all only 2 stars for a beautiful but quite disappointing experience. Tip. Go to the church instead but if you must enter the monastery do so in low season and check in advance because they are prone to random closures for inexplicable reasons.",2
Avoid,"Purchased a ticket online via the official website. Arrived on the day to be find that it was closed and we weren't allowed in. I've emailed and called trying to get a refund and haven't had a response. Not a great look for tourism in Lisbon, but found that to be the case throughout the city...",1
scam,"We had purchased tickets to visit the site on December 31; what was our disappointment to find the site closed even though the website literally indicated ""open"" until 6 p.m.!",1
Wonderful but impossible!,"I was shocked by the infinite queue to enter the cloister of this wonderful building. It seems there is nothing else to visit in the nearbys. I took pics from the outside, but I prefer not ti visit overcrowded sites. Maybe if you book online in advance you can save some time, but the experience is tiring.",2
"Despite having a ticket, I had to queue for an outrageous length of time twice, poor organisation","On the one hand, very beautiful architecture, on the other hand, you have to queue forever only to then have to queue AGAIN to get into the church right next door. We didn't have enough time, the queues were just too long. (Despite buying our tickets early!) The security people were also extremely unfriendly. I almost had the impression that they like to use their opportunity to stop tourists and reprimand them. As a cautious and friendly person, I didn't feel comfortable.
In addition, you can only visit one courtyard and two rooms, which is very disappointing. The building seems to be much bigger. There was also no information about the history of the monastery and life there (no signs, no audio guide, nothing). I would have liked more insight into the past. As it is, it is nothing more than a pretty photo spot, which you could get for free in many church courtyards and cloisters.",2
Bad experience,"Very nice and historically relevant building, however poor organization, expensive for what it is and bad experience. We ran in at 5:25 p.m. because despite closing at 6:30 p.m. they cut off the passage (and the entrances at 5:00 p.m.), when we entered they were already telling us to be “light”. We went straight to the bathroom at the entrance, surprised that only women's toilets were available, neither men nor disabled (closed), nor was one of the women's bathrooms enabled for them (and keeping an eye on them just in case). After this, we went to start the visit, but not before explaining that we had just entered, because they wanted to kick us out without seeing us. We entered and the guide continually followed us, telling us that they were closing (it was 5:35 p.m.) and to the few remaining visitors. We saw them in 10 minutes, literally. When leaving, other visitors who were not allowed to pass were arguing with the guides because of the bad indications of prohibiting access... they should indicate that they close at 5:30 p.m.... anyway, bad experience, if you go, go early.",2
Accessibility 0,"The cloister is a work of art, but accessibility is terrible and non-existent. As you do not exceed 60% disability you have to pay the full entrance fee, you pay it and ask where the elevator is, the answer was ""there is none, you can only visit the ground floor"" surprising
Portugal has a lot to advance in terms of accessibility, it has major deficiencies.",1
"Service for ticket sales is horrible, the totems were not working and the customer service employee was arrogant","Service for ticket sales is terrible, the totems were not working and the customer service employee was arrogant and xenophobic.",1
A scam to avoid,"A scam to avoid at all costs from the outside the building is magnificent and when we arrived in Lisbon it was really the first monument that we wanted to see so I went to the ticket office at 4:58 p.m. to buy 3 tickets using a credit card from the machine tells me payment accepted but the tickets do not come out the 2 ladies on site tell me that they have to pay again even though I had already paid but what should I do so I paid twice for the entrance. The next day I noticed the obvious theft on my bank. I went to the ticket office and found the same people who told me they could do nothing and to contact asset management by email. I send an email and they ask me to send the tickets that I didn't get and the others that I threw away at the end of the visit... In short, be wary and know that we risk you charging twice for a visit which in addition after an episode like this or in a foreign country we are defrauded we really have the impression of being pigeons",1
The line is long!!!!,"As other reviewers have warned, a visit to the monastery may not be a wise expenditure of precious travel time. I would not advise buying tickets on line but suggest going to Belem and purchasing tickets from an uncrowded office across the street - IF you can see that the monastery line is not long. We arrived with tickets in hand about 10:30 on Halloween and saw a line stretching the length of the building and around the corner. The line for the interesting church was short and we enjoyed our visit there, but we scuttled plans to tour the cloisters when it’s line had not shortened. Rain was predicted, so we ate the cost of the tickets. Why does the monastery not offer time slots?

The Explorers Monument is remarkable and Belem offers other reasons to visit. However, be flexible about the logistics of getting there from Lisbon. Following Rick Steve’s lead, we tried to take the 15E bus but watched two westbound buses pass by the Corpo Santo stop because each was already packed with passengers. Two similarly frustrated but kind tourists offered to share a cab with us.

I expect the monastery is as beautiful as others state and wish the monastery would offer time slots.",2
Disgusting Security Staff,"Me and my pregnant wife arrived at the monostary at 9:30am, as we have always wanted to visit it and see it in person. It was cold and raining but we didn't mind waiting as we really wanted to see inside the monastery. My wife was getting quite cold from the rain and the line was very long, so after 30 minutes of standing & waiting in the rain, I quickly went to a coffee shop and brought some coffee back for my pregnant wife - the aim being that we could drink it quickly before we got inside.

The security guard - whose name was Diogo Oliveira - aggressively and abruptly came walking towards me and my pregnant wife in front of everyone. He pulled the barrier back and told me to throw my coffee away and go back to the end of the queue. I politely questioned him why, and he kept speaking loudly telling me to throw my coffee away and to go through the barrier and line up at the back again - after 1hr of waiting.

Me and my wife were very confused and we calmly and politely tried to reason with him to descalate the issue - something he should be trained at doing. He continued speaking very aggressively and made an entire scene in the line with people watching and feeling uncomfortable.

Me and my wife were extremely embarrassed at this point and were shocked that a member of staff - whose sole purpose is to provide security - would escalate such a small issue that could have been dealt with politely and discreetly in order to not to make people feel belittled and embarrassed.

The issue was only resolved as me and my wife refused to go to the back and simply offered to throw our coffee away in the bin - which he eventually agreed to once a police officer came over to see what was going on.

I am disgusted that a member of staff would behave in this way towards tourist. It is unacceptable and completely wrong.",1
Worst Part of Lisbon - Avoid - Not Worth It!,"Absolutely awful experience . Have never been treated as rudely by multiple employees as I was at Jerónimos Monastery. The rest of Lisbon is so pretty and so unique, don’t spend a second dealing with the morons that run this place, or waiting in hours-long lines.

To try and sum up the worst part of Lisbon… The cloister (commonly called “the monastery”) is a complete waste of time. It’s a small courtyard with some nicely done carved pillars/walls. You need to pay 12 Euro to get in. You need to wait in line 90+ minutes to get in. Don’t listen to anywhere that says “skip the line” - you can’t. You circle the courtyard twice and are out in 10 min.

There is also a “church”. This part is free. It has a separate line that is usually slightly shorter. In the mornings, this line is insane, as tour groups cut in and out, and you will be yelled at to buy a ticket and get in the paid line for the cloister even if you want to just see the free church. It is clear employees have been told to bully you into paying to see the cloister.

The worst part is, even if you get in to see the cloister after waiting in line, you then have to come out and get back in line AGAIN to see the church. The church is nice - but wouldn’t put it in the top 15 most impressive churches that I’ve seen in Europe.

My advice - steer clear of this whole place. The garden in front is beautiful, and the exterior of the entire building is by far the most impressive part. Just enjoy a leisurely walk around the building and then go see the rest of beautiful Belem. The walking tour of Belem that we took with Sara was A+.

If anyone from the government or Catholic Church reads this - please do anything in your power to talk to the staff on site. I have simply never been treated this way in my life - not just by one problem employee having a bad day - but by three separate employees. Absurd.",1
Pitiful organization unworthy of a monument of such heritage value,"Despite difficulties obtaining our entry tickets, we queued in front of the monastery for the second time before learning that the site was closed due to a strike.",1
Great Expectations,"Great expectations were dashed upon our visit to this much touted monastery. A friend and I queued for approximately an hour and a half (don’t be misled: buying tickets on line affords you no advantage) in wet and windy conditions, anticipating a rich, historical experience. Sadly, the opposite was true. The visit consisted of circling the upper level and looking down on the quad, a quick visit to a tiled room which had been the refectory, then circling the lower level and looking onto the quad from a different vantage point. The entire visit, as outlined above, but with a quick visit to the Ladies, took fifteen minutes.
A colossal disappointment.",1
Prefer other monasteries in Portugal!,"The first time monastery closed due to official visit no information
And today in place in the queue for the opening and at the time of opening monastery on strike closes today no sign before a shame they even let you buy the tickets 10 minutes before",1
Queuing Nightmare,"Worth seeing but spoiled by ticketing and queuing arrangements. It needs online, timed entry that allows single not separate access to monastery and church.
Selling untimed tickets online that have to be redeemed at a central tourist information office is a ridiculous way to access a major attraction.
The on site ticket office was shut on alternate Sundays including the day we opted to visit.
As Oscar Wilde remarked in a different context, 'worth seeing, not worth going to see.'",2
Not really worth visiting,"The monastery isn't really worth visiting, especially considering the price of the tickets. The logic of the tour is come-see-go. In order to achieve that, there signs at every bench in the monastery informing us that seating is forbidden. I wouldn't recommend visiting the monastery but I would 100% recommend visiting the Santa Maria Church at the entrance of the monastery which is really beautiful and it also free to enter.",2
Bad organization that ruins the experience,"We had booked our tickets in advance thinking of avoiding the line. On site, more than 2 hours of waiting. We had to cancel the visit and lost our tickets. Poor organization, to be avoided. Even if you have already purchased the tickets, you have to queue for the church and then queue again for the cloister.",1
Waste of a day,Ridiculous hours long wait. Stupidly long line even with advance tickets purchased online. What a total crock! Stand in this line for 90 mins (at least) oh and you wanna see the church? Go stand in that line for another 90 mins. They are next to each other! I will never go again. There are dozens of monasteries and churches in Portugal that don’t have freakishly long lines. AVOID.,1
Despite trying three times I couldn't get in and then gave up.,Getting tickets is a challenge! The ticket booth closes early or it closes because of storms and rain! The Headout app is unable to send a ticket within 30 minutes. We had to queue soaking wet in the rain; a roof for the waiting crowds of visitors would have been quite appropriate. We were eventually sent back out into the rain twice by security guards... Then we gave up and cancelled the online tickets.,1
"Terrible service , underwhelming attraction which does not deserve the massive queue.","This was the biggest let down of our trip. Once inside the visit takes 10 minutes at most and is completely underwhelming comprising some cloisters, an austere chapel and a tiled refectory and THAT IS IT.
Booking online we did not expect much of a wait but on arriving there was at least a 100 metre queue which took a hour and a half, with no shelter and being constantly pestered by hawkers and beggars. This also was in the middle of a complete rainstorm which left the whole queue literally soaked to the skin. Why did we not give up? Well some people did…but having paid already and given the lack of information about how uninteresting this attraction actually is, most people opted to wait. If you don’t book online you have to buy tickets from a mirrored booth across the road which is partly obscured by trees. We came to the conclusion that this was a cynical ploy to keep people in the interminable queue.
The problem was that the staff controlling access to the monastery only let one or two people in at a time, sometimes with about a 15 minute wait in between admissions. This did not appear to be for any apparent reason other than being a jobsworth or on a whim and maybe enjoying the sight of increasingly bedraggled tourists. The staff were not monitoring how crowded the venue was nor were they in any radio contact with anyone inside. We would imagine that in summer weather the problem would also be the total lack of shade. When we got inside the numbers of people were very scarce and could certainly have taken some more visitors to relieve the sodden masses outside. Finally there was a massive queue for the ladies toilets which were filthy.",1
The vote is for disorganization!,"The vote is for total disorganization and not for the Monastery which is truly wonderful and unmissable. I find it sincerely embarrassing that despite having purchased the ticket online with a specific time, you have to queue much earlier and still enter well after the time (we had booked for 10.00, we queued at 9.40 and entered shortly before 11am). Furthermore, this is not made explicit anywhere and the staff must continually repeat it to all tourists who ask for information. Furthermore, once inside there are no audio guides... or even illustrative brochures. Considering the level of the monument it's a shame!",1
Rude and disorganized,"Absolutely disorganized and shockingly rude. This scathing review primarily centers on the abysmal organization and mistreatment of independent tourists attempting to visit the church. The staff exhibits zero willingness to offer assistance or answer even the most fundamental inquiries about queuing procedures or the church's opening time, despite the official sources clearly stating 10:30 AM. On the day of our visit, they arbitrarily decided to delay the opening until 11 AM, while granting preferential entry to groups from Viking Cruises and similar organizations. The rest of us were seemingly dismissed with indifference. If you're contemplating an early start to secure your spot in line, well, you're in for a challenge. Good luck with that.",2
Disrespect,"Horrible experience, disrespect for people, kilometer queue, even if purchasing in advance online, could restrict the number of people per day, increase the price, etc. Disorganized is not worth it. 4 hours in line! In the sun",1
Most Unorganized Site in the World,"After visiting sites on 6 continents I would have to say this is one of the most unorganized I have ever seen. The monastery opens around 930 or so. I had a Lisboa Card which was supposed to give me quick access to the site. Some other people also had timed tickets that would give them quick access. Unfortunately they put everyone in the same line: quick access, timed tickets and those that just bought tickets. I got there at around 920 and stood in line for over an hour and they let in only 20 people per hour. I counted the people in front of me and figured it would take another 2 hours to get in. Behind me the line stretched for a mile or so. There was no point to prebooking or getting a Lisboa card for this. I walked away and figured I would not waste any more of my life in the line. This site is an embarrassment to Portugal. Avoid at all costs.",1
Viewing is not worth the amount!,"Ask if everything can be viewed! We stood in line for an hour and bought tickets online while in line. In the meantime, we saw that people who entered the wrong way were simply put at the front by the unfriendly staff. Finally inside, beautiful courtyard, what you would expect. You will have seen this after 20-30 minutes. Then you want to go further into the church, and you are simply sent outside with the message: the church is now closed for 3 hours for the ceremony.
And you pay eur 12 for that...a waste of money, look at the outside and see the inside in photos on the internet.",2
"Great monastry, poor organization","They sell tickets for time slots, however, are unable to organize the access to the monastry. We had to queue over 90 minutes… however, the monastry is superb",2
Bad experience due to queue management,"Lots of people and no queue management. We purchased our tickets in advance with a specific time, and when we arrived there was at least a 2 hour line. We gave up and lost our 2 entries",1
What a desappointment,"No skip-the-line tickets for reservations on the site we queue.
After a good hour, visit folded into 15 minutes.
And repeat to visit the church.
Let's summarize:
Not an essential visit, the exterior is more than enough.
If you can, prefer Alcobaca, Maffra, Batalha, much prettier and full of history.
Too bad 🤦😔",2
"If you like endless queues when you have a Timed slot ticket, this is for you.","The review is not about the place. You have already gotten it’s worth visiting from the number and score of the reviews. Problem is it does not matter if you have a ticket with the time on it to skip the queue, which you have bought choosing a time slot due to availability. You still have to wait one hour in the queue with all the other disappointed ticket owners complaining with you. At least you’ll be in good company. It is embarrassing a more organised system is not in place. Oh, if you do not have a ticket, expect a long queue to get the ticket first and then the other long queue to get in with your brand new ticket. It’s ridiculous. It is 2023, wake up.",1
Explain the time slot on the ticket!,"The place is beautiful, but independently from the time on your ticket (if you book online) you have to queue for long time, like hours. If you book online you can choose a time slot, the funny thing is you also have availabilities, but is a total scam because it doesn’t matter at all.
We were lucky enough not to queue under the sun, but I assume that in summer it might become a nightmare.",1
All that for this…,"Having purchased tickets for the 2 p.m. slot…. We arrived a little early and saw the queue for ticket holders…. We waited 45 minutes to enter the monastery... the visit lasted 20 minutes... I have seen better monasteries with better content... there it was empty and the management needs to be reviewed!!

Then you can visit the church next door but no… you have to go out and queue again…

Don't waste your time!",1
Not worth the detour,"Bad experience, 2 hours of waiting for a 20mm tour of the monastery. Then you have to queue again for another 1.5 hours to visit the church, certainly very pretty but the wait is not worth the detour. The view of the monument from the outside is more than enough in my opinion and is not worth the 3.5 hour wait. I don't recommend it at all, I'm not even talking about the entrance price of 12 euros. Tourist trap for me",2
A Dantesque circle,"I won't add anything more than what others have already said. Both the Monastery and the Igreja deserve three stars but no more, I have seen truly amazing sites in Spain. What infuriates me is the total disorganization I have seen everywhere in Portugal. It is not logical to have to queue for about an hour under the August sun to access the church and then queue for another hour and a half to access the adjacent monastery. There were people not used to the heat in serious difficulty. No preferential access for those who purchased the ticket online or the Lisboa card. Absurd. I absolutely don't recommend it.",1
A bad experience,"Having to queue for over 1 hour in the sun with no shade and no seating with no opportunity to purchase or obtain water is not a good start. For over people it could be life threatening.
With tickets being purchased on line why is there not a timed admission system?
When insudevthercis nowhere where one is allowed to sit ( well there is one but you can't see anything) to rest one's tired legs
Infactvsawcobe elderly man told off for leaning on a wall.
If its hot and a queue avoid its just not worth the wait.",1
Waiting time is unreasonable,We've been waiting in line for an hour (despite having a ticket) and it will probably take another 1-2 hours. Poorly organized entry. Organizing a visit to such a great building so poorly is really a feat. What a pity.,1
2 stars only for the beauty of the place,"As soon as we arrived, we were thrown out by security: they were no longer letting people in before the designated time.

Once we showed that we had the tickets, he first didn't believe us and then had to let us in, all in a rude and aggressive tone.

Inside the monastery, which is magnificent by the way, the staff followed us to each room to let us leave.

The staff has spoiled the beauty of the monument…",2
Line too long,"Be prepared to wait in line for hours, under the scorching sun. There is no need to buy the ticket in advance or the Lisboa card, there is only one queue for everyone. Poor organization. I am speechless.

Buying tickets online or Lisboa card won't let you skip the queue. So be prepared to be in queue for hours.",1
Not worth it,"Even overlooking the endless queue under the sun, and the uselessness of the time indicated on the ticket purchased online, the building is beautiful but if you have already seen the monasteries of Batalha or Alcobaça it adds nothing, especially if you consider that it is practically accessible the cloister alone. It is definitely worth just seeing the church: beautiful, free and with very little queue.",2
"This place suscks, 2 hours queue having pre-buyed tickets","The place maybe is nice to see, but the organization is totally nonsense.
They sell tickets for timed slot but when you come there you are put in the same, endless queue as anyone else.
The result is 2 hours queue under the sun, no shelter, no water, just wait and shut up.",1
"A beautiful, badly managed monastery. If you go, be patient","By organizing the purchase of tickets with a pre-established access time you should guarantee timed entrances but you will have to wait more than 2 hours under the sun. Not the entire monastery can be visited and they ""give you a visit to the adjacent church"". The staff is very rude. If you go, bring: water, a hat and a lot of patience
Too bad the monastery is very beautiful and nearby you can visit the beauty of Belem",2
Terrible treatment of tourists,"Terrible tourist service. Absurd queue, without any information. Buy the ticket at a scheduled time and go to a common queue, in the sun, a complete mess. Don't go to this place. It's a humiliation for tourists",1
BAD SITE!,"Terrible organisation, arrogant, presumptuous and rude staff!
Queuing under the sun, about 90 minutes, we reported to the employees that a person could not stand under the sun due to personal problems and we asked if he could wait his turn in the shade
The answer was: ""you need a medical certificate!""
Shame!
Be careful, timed tickets are put on sale, but then it turns out that the shift is exclusively for the faithful!
Absolutely, site to avoid!",1
TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. Nice building.,"The monastery is very beautiful but you can visit few rooms. And without a doubt THE WORST is the eternal queue you have to wait to get in. 1 hour and a half in line in the sun having bought the tickets online in advance. The management is ridiculous, shameful. Either they change that or I'm not sure if it's worth going.",1
SUPER LONG QUEUES,"Queues of 1.5 hours, I cannot reserve times to enter, it is better to arrive and buy the ticket online not before or you will be surprised by the waiting time, the church is free, it is next door",2
Disappointed and sweaty.,"We paid €42 for the online tickets. There was not much to see for that. The whole shop has the same stonemason motifs over and over again. You can do a round on two levels and that's it. It takes 20 minutes to get through, but you've spent an hour or more cooking in the blazing sun in front of the entrance. Very disappointing.",1
Disappointment,"Disappointed by the management of tickets and waiting. We buy the tickets on the official online website at a certain time. Upon arrival, there was a tremendous queue to enter, assuming that this queue was for people who did not have an assigned time. To our amazement and disappointment, the waiting line is the same for everyone. It doesn't matter that you buy the ticket at a specific time because you have to wait in line anyway. We waited in the sun, without any shade, for an hour and a half.

Therefore, THE ALLOCATED TIME THAT APPEARS ON THE ONLINE TICKETS IS USELESS, AND YOU HAVE TO LINE UP LIKE EVERYONE. In our case, 1 HOUR AND A HALF.

As for the monastery, only the cloister is visible (and the church next door is free). It is beautiful, although it takes 20 - 30 minutes to see it and it has nothing spectacular and notable compared to other monasteries.",1
Terrible organization. I would not return nor recommend it,"Bad organization. Tickets purchased on the website with time selection. We entered 120 minutes later waiting in an eternal line and in full sun.
I would have enjoyed the interior if we hadn't arrived so tired.",1
Waste of time,"Said it would take an hour and it took 15 min after 1 hour in line…

It’s basically a courtyard. Look at the pictures and save yourself the money and time.",2
O mosteiro do desgosto,"First is the long queues, with no fast tracking option. The visit is literally about 10 minutes going round. You not allowed to seat on the benches, not allowed to go in the patio, 90% of the rooms are closed and for 8.50 euros is a rip off. Not even the Buckingham palace have those restrictions. The only monument that I visit that’s not worth visiting. I don’t recommend and I hope the Portuguese authorities change this restrictions.",1
The Hieronymites monastery should be avoided,"We had purchased our tickets in advance.
We were lucky, the queue in the line only lasted about 25 minutes. The cloister is very pretty, however no explanation, the visit can be very quick. To go see the cathedral we are asked to queue again in the other direction, unacceptable. So another 15 min wait. This is absolutely not managed. The staff is only there to monitor the line. We really feel like stupid tourists. I advise you to take advantage of the outside for some photos and go to the maritime museum next door, it will be cheaper and more interesting.",1
online service does not meet schedules buy online,"Hello

disappointed with online service. there is absolutely no point in buying online and choosing a schedule. because he doesn't respect it. you arrive there and you queue.
we had booked for 9:30 am and we waited in the 1:30 am queue. our time being limited in the capital. a disgrace of service for an important and recognized monument. if you are taken by the time to avoid. the staff is already conditioned to answer you, they know it and ask you to make a complaint in a jaded tone.",1
See the pictures online and enjoy the holiday,"Totally ridiculous with that queue, we didn't mind. Lots of other places to see and don't want to be laughed at and stand and cook in that sun. Then went for a walk around the area 5 * to it 😊",1
Deception when purchasing tickets on the official website with entry time selection,"Pathetic organization!
You buy tickets on the official website with a selection of entry time and they don't care! You have to wait in line, entering at the end 90 minutes later than the time selected and even indicated on your ticket.",1
"Don't go there, avoid it","Absolutely don't go there for 3 hours in a queue from 8 in the morning... a disaster, look at the attached photos... and then go in and discover that it's just a cloister on two floors... stop, no big deal.
Furthermore there is the church attached which is free compared to the monastery but you have to go out and queue again to get back under the sun for another few hours...absurd.
Don't book, there's no need, they don't keep booking timetables.
Don't go there at all, it's a waste of money... and that's not all... it's the time you waste under the sun...
We arrived at 8 in the morning and it opened at 9, and we entered at an absurd 11.30.",1
"Ridiculously long line, time slots are not respected.","Although I had bought tickets online before 10 am and I got there well in time, I stood in line for 1.5 hours in the blazing sun before I got inside. What use is a ticket with a time slot if it is not looked at at all? Worthless. Perhaps they should be trained in Spain where time slots at well-known sights in Granada, Seville and Cordoba are respected/work well and regulate the crowds. Doesn't detract from the monastery, but access could be much better",2
It’s not worth 2 hours waiting under the Sun,"The cloister was really beautiful but it was not worth the waiting in Line for 2 hours under the sun.
We visited the place on the 15th of August: since it was an holiday, we bought the tickets online for 11.00 am.
It turns out that the time slot’s tickets was totally useless: there was only one waiting line (so long it reached the nautica museum) and you had to get in line even if you had tickets.
We waited 2 hours (literally 2 hours) and finally it was our turn.
It is possible to visit ONLY the cloister: it’s really beautiful but the visit took 20 minutes at maximum.
If you would like to visit even the church you have to do ANOTHER WAITING LINE!!!
That’s simply ridicolous.
Cherry on pie was that there wasn’t so many people inside so they could have let more tourists in!
One star for the terrible organization.
If you still want to visit the place, do not underestimate the sunlight: we were sunburt, so take with you water, sunscreen and an umbrella.",1
Terrible experience. Don't go there if you don't want to get sunstroke,"It's absurd how a national monument can be so poorly and disorganized managed! And it's absurd how no one rebels! The queue to enter lasts more than 4 hours in a square under the sun! There is no point in purchasing tickets online, the scheduled time is not respected in any way, everyone has to queue at random, even those who have just purchased their ticket at the ticket office (completely empty, with no queue). Never seen such a situation, a lady felt ill. The staff were rude and unsympathetic. It's not worth going there. I advise you against it",1
What after paying in advance,"We booked and paid, for a visit at 12.30 we have been queuing for over an hour and there will be an hour until we enter. Under the sun. Terrible setbozio",1
Logistics to be modified,"The Monastery of Los Jeronimos is very beautiful, an unmissable visit. However, I give one star for the way in which the logistics are managed: in 2023 we waited 2 and a half hours in line in the August sun (compared to the visit which lasts about 30-45 minutes) and the line is not reported/controlled, guys rude people continued to enter the queue disrespectful of the people who had been waiting for hours. Even when we pointed out to them that the queue started elsewhere, they replied that they knew it but that they still did not move from the ""earned"" position. Aside from the sadness of certain encounters, it is absurd that so many hours have to be spent in line which could be used to the greater benefit of the city and its visitors.",1
Line,"Disorganization is the key word unfortunately. The place is wonderful, the visit lasts about an hour (in which you will essentially see arcades) but you will most likely get there exhausted from the hours spent in line. To enter, in fact, you will not need to buy the ticket online with a pre-established time, here you will find the same queue for ""with ticket"" and ""without ticket"". So prepare yourself and arm yourself, above all with lots and lots of patience.",2
BAD,"BAD ORGANIZATION

There is no point in purchasing the ticket with a predefined time, limiting the number of entries, if the queue is random: first come, first served.
A tip: arrive at least half an hour before opening time and you will avoid hours of queuing.",1
Terrible queue at 40 degrees,"A very long queue to enter at 40 degrees, waiting a long time despite arriving at 9:30...There were those who wanted to sneak in, so pay attention...They could organize it by time slots...the queue is deadly. Very nice interior.",2
Very beautiful but welcome to see again,"No flow management, 1 hour wait under the sun, no explanation on the site.
Accompanied by a disabled person with very reduced mobility, the reception was deplorable. Furthermore, she could only be accompanied by one person. No seat to sit on.
The site is very beautiful but the conditions need to be reviewed.",2
Family visit,"documenting in advance because there is no explanation or audio guide. The cultural content is weak and nothing wow
On the other hand, to visit the church, you have to queue again, in short, not serious. This deserves a reorganization of flows.
Contrary to what online sales operators sell, including the Lisboa card, there is no wire cutting, it's a scam",2
Shameful and catastrophic,"After purchasing tickets on the monastery website for that day at 11:30 a.m., we arrived 15 minutes early. The queue was 3 hours long, the guard at the entrance told us. In fact, given the crowds waiting in full sun, there was enough time for 3 hours. We turned back! What is the point of purchasing tickets with a time slot in advance? This is pure theft!",1
Much better to see in Lisbon!,"2 hours in line for a building that is certainly very beautiful but which does not deserve this wait under the sun. The essential thing, in my opinion, is seen from the outside. The sculptures are incredible. Take the time to look at them, you will save time and money.",1
Bad luck,"Unfortunately we have not been able to access the Monastery. We bought the Lisbon card and we couldn't enter due to WYD restrictions that, even knowing what was going to happen, no one in Lisbon warned in time. Three days after the papal arrival we tried to go and seeing a line in the sun lasting more than 2 hours made us give up. Like this, there are many other examples of how Lisbon has “turned its attention” to WYD2023 and has neglected tourists who, like us, I don't think will return to the Portuguese capital for a long time. Bad management and little honesty.",1
"Move on, really.","Simply a scam! 1h10 wait from the opening, the staff is not friendly, groups of 50 people walk past you. For a 15 min visit, 2 tombs, 1 empty refectory without explanation, no access to the church, in short for 10 euros for two, move on, go instead to the electricity museum 200 m away which is 1000 x more interesting and motivating.",1
Forfærdelig lang kø trods forhåndskøbt billet. Smuk klostergård,"Ventede i kø i en time trods forhåndskøbt billet Virkede håbløst arrogant og ineffektivt at lade så mange mennesker vente i over 30 graders bagende sol, når der var masser af plads da vi først kom ind.
Selve klostergården var meget smuk, men vi var dybt skuffede over, at så lang ventetid kun bød på selve gården. Meget lidt information.
Vil fraråde alle der rejser i højsæson den oplevelse",2
Waste of time and money,"Don't waste your money or time. We paid to ""skip the queue"" for a slot, waited over an hour in the blistering sun just to walk around for 15mins. That's it, 5-10 mins and it isn't worth £10.

I strongly advise not booking ahead. Go there, check the queue, question if you want to pay the fee

The queue took far too long to process",1
Not worth the time!,Most of the monastery is closed to the public. The part you can see only takes about 10 to 15 minutes and there is very little to it. Given that the line to get in is 30 to 90 minutes it is a total waste of time to go see this.. picture of another fountain,1
"Só conseguir ver o exterior, tamanha fila na entrada.","O exterior do mosteiro é muito lindo, mas não consegui entrar, na verdade nem tentei, pois a fila é desanimadora. Certamente o visitante fica em pé no minimo 1,5h para entrar, Lamentável!",2

Tanta fila sotto il sole x vedere poco,"Scusate ma x un italiano non ne vale la pena. Avevamo biglietti x le 9:30 il primo ingresso possibile. Arriviamo in uber in orario perché il sito è fuori mano e alle 9:30 già cera fila. Dopo un ora entriamo e scopriamo che la fila con il biglietto è solo x il chiostro; se vuoi vedere la chiesa che è nello stesso complesso, ti fanno uscire fuori e ti chiedono di metterti di nuovo in fila perché l ingresso x la chiesa è gratuito e devi farti un altra ora di coda in ina fila dedicata: noi delusi siamo andati via dopo aver visto il chiostro. Bello ma x la fila fatta a saperlo me lo sarei risparmiato. Organizzazione e comunicazione pessima",2
Geen ticket met tijdslot boeken,"Geen ticket vooraf boeken! Het geboekte tijdslot kennen ze niet en je staat als nog in de lange rij.
Tip: ga in de namiddag, dan is de rij korter.",2
No respect from staff,"Deplorable customer service.
We Asked where to buy tickets and were grunted at to join the queue. One hour later in roasting summer sun we reached the end of the queue, we were screeched at for having no tickets and refused help or holding our position in the queue while we fixed the problem.
We refused to queue again.
Very disappointed.",1
Worst experience in Lisbon and only Balem tower is somehow compatible to how bag one tourist attraction could be.,This is the biggest tourist trap I experienced in Lisbon. We got the Lisbon card that supposed to include fast track. It actually didn't. We waited on the sun for almos a hour and when we got inside we saw nothing. They alow to to walk only on the outside and there is nothing realy nothing to see there. Better save your money and go to see the Lisbon catedral.,1
Terrible experience at Jeronimos Monastery - avoid if you can,"I would give this site 0 stars if I could. This would be regarding management and planning for entrance. We bought timed tickets online for 10:00 am. Got there at 10:15 am only to be told that it doesn't matter that we have timed tickets!!, we need to queue with all the other people some of whom didn't have tickets. What is the point of selling timed tickets and not taking them into consideration??? Lines were extremely long, in the full sun with temperatures getting over 30C. I estimated maybe 2 hours of wait. We didn't stay. There were 2 lines: 1 for regular people and 1 for groups. Of course, the groups were many and they also had to queue. They might have had priority. Also I heard the security people talking very rudely with the groups to the point that the guide had to intervene. Really, this is how Portugal treats their visitors??? I would avoid this place till they review their management.",1
Disorganizzazione allo stato puro,"Avevamo prenotato il biglietto sia con giorno e orario , ma al nostro arrivo non era possibile visitarlo poiché c’era una manifestazione ( non segnalato al momento della nostra prenotazione ) . Abbiamo dovuto attendere il pomeriggio e fare una fila interminabile sotto il sole cocente ( cosa che avviene regolarmente) , oltretutto il personale e’ abbastanza scorbutico ( nonostante i grossi disagi creato dalla disorganizzazione) . Il tempo speso e il costo del biglietto non vale assolutamente la visita , ci sono luoghi decisamente più meritevoli a Lisbona .",2
"Good site, but you better think twice before going. On line time slot reservations are NOT honored!","Great place and beautiful architecture but you better consider the extremely disorganized and chaotic entrance before you go. No point on reserving a time entry, you have to make the line anyway, online time slots are NOT honored. The line can be up to 2 hours (in the full sun) and the personnel are very rude and unprofessional. The long line outside makes no sense, there is plenty of space inside and the building is big enough to allow more people without crowding it. This facility is managed by ""Patrimonio Cultural"" (state agency) and that explains it all...
My personal advise is that any line longer than 20 minutes (specially in rough weather conditions) is NOT worth it.
However you should check the church next to it (Santa Maria de Belem), the entrance is free (restricted during Mass times) and it is as beautiful inside as it is outside. You might want to check the explanation posted on the right side of the entrance, it provides all you need to know about the decoration and details of the door entrance.",2
disorganizzazione,"Avevo da tempo desiderato di visitare il Monastero ma ahimè il desiderio non si è avverato a causa della pessima organizzazione. Avevo prenotato la visita con scelta non solo del giorno ma anche dell'ora, con la certezza di accedere in quell'orario, come succede in qualsiasi altro sito.
Invece devi metterti in coda come gli altri che non hanno nessuna prenotazione, sotto un sole cocente e con tempi di attesa lunghissimi col risultato che, gran parte della gente rinuncia, pur avendo già pagato.
Sarà veramente disorganizzazione?",1
Pésima experiencia de ingreso,"Llegamos con 34 grados, entradas compradas online... y sin embargo nos sorprendio encontrar una linea de unos 150mts de personas...Necesitabamos espeear minimo hora y media para ingresar. De nada servía tener los tickets. Pésimo el sistema. Nunca llegamos a entrar ya q lastimosamente no teniamos disponible ese tiempo para esperar.",1
Batiment exceptionnel,Tickets online de 10 eurs par personne pour 10h30. Arrivée 9h50 déjà une file assez conséquente. Nos billets ne permettent un passage réservé. Entrée 11h10 . Temps d attente en plein soleil assez long. Visite +ou- 1h . Endroit exceptionnel qu il faut voir ! Mais très mauvaise organisation des entrées avec les groupes qui passent avant et si vous voulez voir la même chose qu eux il faut refaire la file. Beaucoup de critiques dans la file d attente qui étaient justifiées car plein soleil et ça n' avançait pas . Donc pour moi a éviter si vous n' êtes pas en groupe ! Les horaires sur le site de réservation online complètement inutile puisque vous devez faire la file ! Perte de temps importante et a déconseiller pour les personnes agées. File d attente jusqu au parking des bus .,2
Don't believe the hype,"Not worthwhile the long waiting line (2hrs) in the hot sun or the price (10euro). Basically the insight court of the monastery, walking the upstairs and downstairs corridors, no exhibits, no story or indications, not audio guide. The pace is slow and the organization of the site lacks a lot. To spend at most 1 hr inside it is not worth the 2hr queing",1
Seems to be a nice place,Even if you book a slot you won‘t get into the monastery if you are not prepared to stand in line for- in our case- 2hrs. As it was very hot and we didn‘t want to go through this ordeal we forfeited our tickets. At least from the outside the place is beautiful,2
Attente interminable pour peu de choses à l’arrivée,"Franchement, c’est une épreuve.
Vous achetez des tickets sur le Net, coupe-file, peut-on lire.
En fait, vous ne coupez pas du tout à la file d’attente !
Plus d’une heure en plein soleil, je n’ose imaginer ce que ce serait en été…
L’architecture est, certes grandiose, mais la décoration est plutôt chargée, voire lourde…
La visite est vite faite, vous déambulez autour d’une belle cour intérieure, prenez quelques photos et puis c’est tout.
L’accès à l’église est gratuit.
Mais il faut refaire la queue…
On a laissé tomber.
Allez plutôt vous goinfrer de pasteis de Belem !",1
Horrible guard on entrance,"Pretty building but terrible experience with the round-faced guard working on the entrance on 3 June 2023 between 5-5.30pm. Having rushed to get there in time, he was lying to tourists that it closed at 5 (when actually last entrance 5.30 for 6pm closing). He then lied about the ticket office being closed and ages away. I then started buying a ticket online as not yet 5.30 and he taunted me saying I would never manage to buy in time and even if it was 5.30 he wouldn't let me in (5.29 latest). Bizarre behaviour, as if he enjoyed turning away tourists and going on a weird power trip. Luckily I bought the ticket before 5.30 and another guard let me through, but unfortunately other tourists left disappointed when he first lied about it being closed. Inside was pretty but not loads to see (so can do it in far less than half an hr). Overall an unpleasant experience.",2
Disappointing monastery waiting time!,Very disappointing day at Belem. Very Very Long queues even at 9.30/10am and also even if you have purchased tickets in advance it seems to make no difference. Be prepared to stand in the queue and in the heat. We will come in winter to get in as otherwise just not worth it. We went to beautiful tropical gardens behind the famous custard tart shop just to escape the crowds. Not worth spoiling holiday for these crazy queues.,1
Online Tickets sind ein Schwindel,"Was für ein Schwindel !
Es werden Zeittickets verkauft. Allerdings so viele dass trotzdem 1h Schlangestehen notwendig ist. Das Personal interessieren die Zeitfenster gar nicht. Genauso kann man Vorort Tickets kaufen, das macht keinen Unterschied. Für mich ist das ein Betrug weil man dem online Käufer vormacht er müsse pünktlich da sein und sich so das Anstehen sparen.",1
Delusione totale,"Apertura 9:30... peccato che pur essendo tra i primi fino alle 10:30 fermi on lisbona card perché fan passare davanti tutti i gruppi... visto che di chiese ce ne sono tante a questo mondo, pagare 10 euro per vedere per più tempo l'entrata che gli interni di questa penso sia assolutamente evitabile....",1
"Inexcusable lines, avoid","This was the only attraction I declined to see in Lisbon, and I don't regret it. Twice within a week, I ventured here and twice the lines were insanely long, despite a system of timed tickets. We're talking 60-90 minutes baking under the sun, according to live postings on social media. Forget it. A vacation is about relaxing, not working. Yes, the monastery exterior is beautiful from the outside. But I can't speak about the interior. If you go to Belem, check out the nearby contemporary art museum, the explorers' monument and the Tower instead, all within walking distance. Whoever runs the monastery must overhaul its ticketing and queuing system, because now it's losing visitors like me.",1
Ruined by mass tourism,"Looks nice from the outside, but it has been destroyed by mass tourism. Swathes and swathes of tourists descend on it and the queues are astronomical. You can't visit without spending hours and hours stood in a queue and it is not worth it.
In the other end of the monastery is the maritime museum, it is better to go in that, you actually get to go in some of the monastery buildings and there was no wait.",1
Quelle honte,"Une queue interminable alors que nous avions pris le soin de prendre nos billets sur internet avec un slot horaire précis. La réponse qui m’a été donnée par le gardien est que l’horaire sur le billet est à titre indicatif. Même pas le courage d’assumer leur incompétence dans la gestion d’une file d’attente. Et quand on voit les personnes âgées qui attendent sous le soleil…. C’est juste inadmissible vu le type de monument!!
A titre d’information, les files d’attente au palais de Peña à Sintra sont également organisées par créneaux horaires, mais avec des pancartes bien visibles derrières lesquelles chacun attend en fonction de son horaire de visite.
Le cloître vaut le coup, mais bon…. Nous avons largement préféré l’église, pour laquelle il faut ressortir et refaire une seconde queue mais beaucoup plus rapide cette dernière.",2
Horrible logistics,"Be forewarned that although you reserve tickets for a certain time, tour groups get priority, and if there are many groups at the time you arrive you may wait in line well past the time on your reservation. There is no signage and It is hard to find anyone to provide information about the different lines, and why some go very slowly. We only found out what was going on by asking a lot of people until we found someone who knew. Make sure you are in the correct line and be prepared for what can be a long wait if you indeed want to go in. None of the people working for the Monastary seem to care how frustrating this can be for visitors",2
Une honte dans la gestion des queues et les passe droits,"Une heure de queue après avoir acheter le billet sur internet pour le cloître et voir défiler tous les groupes. Puis après la visite du cloître on est obligé de refaire la queue pour visiter l’église
On se moque de nous une honte",2
Te lang wachten vs tijd binnen,"aanrader om tickets op voorhand te kopen.
Zelfs dan nog lang aanschuiven… dus wees vroeg.
Bezoek zelf is in vergelijking met aanschuiven kort, persoonlijk niet in evenwicht. Heb je minder tijd bezoek dan enkel de kerk (is gratis) en
Minder lang aanschuiven",1
terrible staff,"it is nice inside but terrible staff behaviour..
bought tickets online but waited in the line with all others.
make sure you know in whitch line you are standing because there are three of them",1
Pésima organización. Nunca vi algo asi,"El monasterio es muy bonito pero lo empalidece la pésima organización. Para la entrada. Filas de cuadras, lentitud exasperante, horas de espera. Nunca vi algo así. Ni a propósito se puede hacer peor.",1
If your hobby is queuing you will love it,"In an unusually warm April (30°) this is the worst place to visit.
Not because it is unattractive but because you can't visit without queuing for 2 hours.
Yes you read it right... TWO hours.
We bought Lisboa cards which gave us ""skip the queue"" admission.
The 2 hour queue was for the ""skip the queue"" entry by the way....
I don't normally review places I've not been into but I felt I had to because the Lisboa card isn't worth the money.
Lisbon is a popular cruise ship stopover now.
Two in daily during our city break, disgorging up to 10,000 visitors at a time.

Trotz Ticket stundenlanges Warten. Besser nicht.,"Eigentlich ein Topziel in Lissabon. Trotz Ticket muss man stundenlang in der Sonne warten. Auch schon am frühen Morgen, wenn die Sonne schon über 25 C erreicht hat. Kein Schatten",1
Trop d'attente pour un petit tour de cloître,Bien sûr c'est magnifique maintenant faire 1h30 de queue en plein soleil pour faire 20 mn de cloître c'est pour moi un mauvais compromis. Une fois sortis du cloître il faut refaire la queue pour aller dans l'église...j'ai donc lâché l'affaire.,2
Laaange Warteschlange trotz Lisboacard Gratiseintritt,Leider haben wir es nicht hinein geschafft!!! Achtung! Trotz Lisboacard/Gratiseintritt unendlich lange Wartezeit in der prallen Sonne!!!,1
Not worth the excruciating wait.,Terrible wait outside - over an hour with prosthesis knee and husband with bad feet and walking stick. Nowhere to sit. No sign to ticket office so could have queued for nothing!!!! Luckily people in queue told us. No advantage getting online ticket as same queue. Must be a bit of a shock to find they get visitors as they are not in the least prepared!!!,1
Personnel très désagréable à la limite de la politesse,"Un lieu vraiment très beau mais un personnel absolument horrible qui abuse de son pouvoir. Nous faisons la queue 1 h pour rentrer dans le monastère. Puis au moment de rentrer dans la chapelle on nous demande de refaire la queue a autre endroit ( de façon très désagréable) alors 30 personnes devant nous viennent de rentrer.
Incompréhensible et surtout très très désagréable !!!",1
Entry Process is Ridiculous,"My husband and I visited the Monastery on Tuesday, March 28. I bought the tickets online from the Patrimonio Cultural (Directorate General for Cultural Heritage) government site. The site says they are responsible for the direct management of 26 monuments and museums, for which they provide information and sell tickets. One of those sites is the Jeronimos Monastery. I assumed that when the site said the Monastery requires a date and time booking, and then does indeed require you to pick both before you can buy a ticket, that it was legitimate. When we arrived at the site, however, and I asked staff (3 of them, at two different locations) where we should line up for access with a timed ticket, it was all they could do to keep to a smirk and not actually laugh outright at me. I was told that tickets are sold on many sites and none of them is any different from any other. They did not even look at my ticket - we were just told to get in line with everyone else. I have seen people mention in other reviews that they didn't get in until well past the time they signed up for, so I would like to make it clear that in our case, the problem wasn't just that they were running late, the problem was that they were not acknowledging that timed entry for individuals existed at all. I don't know if this is a problem with the setup/wording of the website - perhaps they mean to say that groups have to have timed entry but it doesn't apply to individuals? But in that case, why do individuals still have to pick an exact time for entry, or allowed to buy tickets at all? And why are those in charge of entry at the actual Monastery not trained with an appropriate response for all those who arrive with expectations?

Anyway, we chose to wait - an hour and half - to go into the Monastery. The part that you get to see is very limited and although the architecture is undeniably beautiful, even taking our time to admire it and take photos, we were only there for 30 minutes. I would suggest not lining up for more than half an hour for entry - there are many other historic buildings to see in the Lisbon area that also have beautiful architecture.",2
DECEPCIÓN MAYÚSCULA.,"Lo primero que debes tener en cuenta al ir a visitar el ""Monasterio de los Jerónimos"" es que no vas a visitar el Monasterio, y eso ya empieza mal. Lo único que se visita es el claustro del Monasterio y no entras en ninguna estancia salvo que vayas al servicio. Lo segundo es que arquitectónicamente es bonito, claro, como todos, pero vamos, en España hay cientos como este o mejores. Y lo tercero, Lisboa, ahí la tienes, está masificada de turismo y nosotros estuvimos esperando dos horas de reloj para una visita de apenas 30 minutos, todo ello sin reparar en el precio, que NADA en Portugal a nivel turístico es barato. Mención especial con el personal de seguridad y de atención al público, el trato deja mucho que desear. Ya he cumplido y no me volverán a ver.",2
Pure oplichting,Tickets online gekocht voor 13h00. We komen exact om 13h00 toe waar een arrogant mannetje in een uniform ons duidelijk maakt dat we netjes achteraan de rij mogen aansluiten om pas een uur later binnen te kunnen. Waarom een website maken (overigens voor het grootste deel enkel in portugees) met slots per half uur als je je er toch geen fluit van aantrekt. Als excuus en vergoelijking voert dat sujet dan nog aan dat er al mensen in de rij staan met tickets om om 10h30 binnen te gaan. Alsof dat het beter zou maken ???,1
Pas pu rentrer,"Désolé par avance. Mais il y a un site, pour acheter des places en avance, et booker une date ainsi qu'un créneau horaire. Ça ne sert à rien. Queue énorme devant le monastère. De une a deux heure je dirais. (on a tenté d'attendre 30mn, on a pas fait 1/4 de la file) on ne pouvais pas casser notre programme de la journée on a donc pas pu accéder au monastère.

Muy triste, no es para el estándar de turismo europeo.",1
La coda non giustifica la visita,Dopo un ora di coda nonostante i biglietti comprati online siamo riusciti ad entrare. L'interno è effettivamente molto bello ma la visita non dura più di 20-30 minuti. Quindi ho avete molto tempo da perdere o non ne vale la pena. In aggiunta il costo del biglietto non ti dà diritto all'ingresso della chiesa tagliando la coda che anche qui è dell'ordine delle ore.,2
"Didn’t got inside, cause of organization","We got in day when was first Sunday of month and it was free. We didn’t need this entrance for free, but we were there and wanted to look inside.

Please put some sign in website if it is for free then as well aware to take the ticket where written archeology museum, otherewise like we and others who were standing in the queue 1,5 h and even ask before the security is it really for free - yes! We continue to stand! After 1,5 h in the queue - sorry we and othere just turn away not to visit this important place.
Please put some signs or signs on the queue to avoid such experience for others!",1

Not worth it!!!,"My daughter and I had timed tickets for 11:00 am on March 28, 2023. We had to wait in line for an hour and 40 minutes passed our allotted time to go in. We were only inside for about 20 minutes. So not worth it!!! Then came out and waited in line for the chapel for about 10 minutes. The chapel is free and has a short line so I recommend just going there.",1
Overrated….,"Presumably one of the must-see places, UN World Heritage site. In reality, grandiose architecture but empty inside. No connection or stories with who used to live here.
Even with an online ticket for a time slot, be prepared to wait in line a long time (45 min or more on this Wednesday morning). The neighboring church with Vasco da Gama’s tomb is free but there is another line to get in. And it’s kind of dark, no connection spiritually or otherwise.",2
Lovely building but not worth a 50 minute wait to get in.,Yes the monastery is a very beautiful building but when you have to wait for 50 minutes to get in you start to question if you really want to go.We finally got in and spent out 30 minutes inside nothing much really to see came out more queues for the church so decided to go home via the jam packed trams.,2
"Not a ""must see""","It is admittedly an incredible building. It is beautiful and it is huge... but as others have said, you stand in line for a very long time to get in. And you are literally in there for 15 minutes. All you see are The Cloisters and there is very little in the way of written information. And then once you leave The Cloisters there is another big long line to see the cathedral. We did not even bother with that. In my mind this was a tourist trap and kind of a waste of time",2
WARNING!!!!,"Warning: unless you buy an advance ticket on line, you will need to go through three lines, one to get your ticket, one to enter the monestary and one to enter the church. Each can take from 30 minutes to an hour. The ticket line is separate from the monestary line and located in the archaeological museum some distance away.

There are no timed entry except for authorized groups between 9:30 and 10:30.

Suggestion: buy ticket in advance and show up near closing to avoid long wait for an attraction worth about 45 minutes.",1
Décevant,"Le monastère est très beau mais nous ne pouvons visiter que la grande cour centrale et ses balcons sur 2 étages, une visite d'à peine 20 à 30mn.

La file d'attente est 3 fois plus longue que la visite.

Réserver un créneau horaire sur Internet à l'avance ne sert à rien, il n'y a qu'une seule file d'attente pour tout le monde, avec ou sans billets.

Il est possible de visiter l'église avec le même billet, mais il faut faire de nouveau la queue.

Pour 10eur, ça ne vaut pas le coup.",2
Ticket nonsense,"Queued for 40 minutes expecting to be able to buy a ticket onsite. Turns out the ticket office is in the Archaeological Museum next door, no signage anywhere to tell you this apart from a tiny a4 piece of paper. Gave up.",1
Grande déception,"Autant d’attente pour si peu. Inclus dans la Lisboa Card, j’aurais été particulièrement déçu si j’avais payé des billets…
Après la courte visite du cloître (parce qu’il n’y a pas vraiment rien d’autre ouvert à la visite), nous aurions dû refaire à nouveau une autre file pour visiter l’église, ce que nous n’avons pas fait - assez de temps perdu.
Je ne comprends pas la surévaluation de cette visite…",2
Urlaub in der Warteschlange,"Selbst in der Nebensaison unfassbar lange Wartezeiten. Null Info vom Personal, wie lange die ungefähre Wartezeit beträgt.",1
Terrible queuing system so expect to lose a chunk of your day,"We booked online and hence expected a queue jump. However, you’re forced to wait in a huge queue for 1 hour plus. There’s no reason for this, they control the number of people entering but it’s a huge place and it was barely crowded. You’re then done within 20-30 mins as there isn’t much to see.

If you can go when the queue is tiny, it’s worth it. If not, unfortunately they haven’t entered the 21st century and force you to queue for a huge amount of time. What’s worse is when you book online you have to choose an entry time which is helpful to plan your day around. Yet, this is meaningless when you turn up, you’ll enter 1-1.5 hours after that time so good luck.",2
É realmente interessante pra vc?,Não vá ao local “porque todo mundo vai”. Pesquise antes para ver se faz sentido pra vc. Eu não fiz isso e não tive uma boa experiência - por isso posso te dar este conselho.,2
Horrível,"Equipe de segurança na fila extremamente despreparada, com nítidos problemas de nervos, gritando e debochando de crianças somente pq passaram por baixo das fitas que fazem demarcação das filas sendo que não havia nenhuma pessoa na fila!

Não recomendo essa atração a nenhuma pessoa que vá a Portugal!",1
Waste of money. The church is for FREE,"Don’t pay the 10€!! That’s just to visit a patio.
The church is the most beautiful building and you can get in for FREE.
A poor experience for the money.

The 10€ is just to see the patio and a hallway.
Granted, they have a nice architecture, but nothing extraordinary.

The staff is mostly rude and they try to ignore any questions to make you pay the visit.
It’s just not worth the money.

Pity, with a friendlier staff and a fee according to the sights I’d walked out with a different experience.",2
Andate presto!,"Se siete a Lisbona, andateci, perchè è bello, ma preparatevi a una coda infinita (anche con la Lisboa card). Diciamo almeno 1h di coda e 40' di visita.

Very limited display,"The Carmo has a historical significance for the Portugese and I respect it. But the display is rather dull, with a small number of artifacts to examine if compared to other museums, even small ones. There's a movie about the Carmo, but it is simply not enough. After 30 minutes we were done. Maybe it's better to visit with a guide.",2
there are better places to learn more about Lisbon and roman times.,"I visited the Carmo Archaeological Museum during a week long visit to Lisbon.

The museum consists of the church nave, open to the sky, and a few rooms of archaeological items - church art and carvings, some new world artifacts, and some roman era artifacts. I found the place ok, but it didn't have the depth of collection of other museums, nor was it good at helping tell the story of the artifacts.

I much preferred the Museu da Lisboa in Campo Grande (great collection, nice space), and Museu do Teatro Romano. For roman history, the Nucleo Arqueologico da Rua dos Correiros (underneath Millennium BCP's offices) told a much better story about life in Lisbon in the past during their short guided tour, and the similar ruins visible on the ground floor of Casa dos Bicos were nice once I understood the story from Nucleo Arqueologico about garam production in Lisbon during the roman era.",2
You don't miss much,"I consider that it is not an essential place to see in Lisbon. You don't miss too much.

There are no detailed explanations of the different archaeological remains (from different periods) that appear, only the name. It consists of 4 small rooms, one of them being a room where they display an explanatory video (it is original) of the history of the monument.

What is striking is the nonexistence of the roof and the remains that remain.

The entrance fee is €5 (adults), and the duration of the visit is personal, but in my case, approximately 20-30 minutes.",2
Total waste of 6 minutes and €10,"Thought this place would be interesting, paid €5 each to get inside to find most of it was covered in scaffold and cladding. We stayed all of 6 minutes and left laughing at the farce of it all. We have monuments at home that are far more interesting than this and are normally free to get into. It’s really not worth it.
Love wandering around Lisbon, it is a really interesting city, we have travelled to a lot of places and major cities, not all reviewed on here and I can honestly say we have never been anywhere with as many unorganised queues as Lisbon. Even Venice wasn’t this bad!",1
Very disappointing,"Only reproductions (poorly proportioned), the few comments that ""explain"" the works are not enough to make it a must in my opinion.
13€ is far too expensive for a not at all immersive experience. After some research on the Internet, these ""museums"" are not approved at all by the artist, as are reproductions that are made without authorization. Slot machines ... In short very disappointing.",2
Robbing Banksy,"This should be called the anti-Banksy museum as it's contradicting everything he stands for. It is unoriginal and commercialised. A copy of Christ with Shopping Bags is there, ironically near the gift shop selling whatnots probably from sweatshops. I think it's shockingly disrespectful to the artist.",2
Care.,I went to school and the care was terrible. The people who visited us are super bad-humored and poorly educated. I do not recommend making the visit with a guide there is more preference of solo with people so it is better alone than poorly accompanied.,1
Just one room,It was interesting but it is literally 1 room with portraits of Portugal's presidents around the sides and an assortment of random gifts received on state visits.,2
What a beautiful museum!Shame the Guide,"The museum is valuable and so is the setting. Beautiful rooms, beautiful objects. A real shame that the Guide (guided tours only) is absolutely not up to scratch: it provides basic, essential explanations and, what is worse, does not give visitors time to see. He seems in a great hurry to send them away!",2
There’s nothing to see.,Nothing to see here - a few rooms with baskets and nothing else. No “folk art” at all. I am sure that there are many types of Portuguese folk arts that could be displayed but nothing here.,1
Your cup of tea,"Whatever is in exhibit, it is not everyone's cup of tea. If it is, you will like it. If it is not, not worth visiting.",2
The archaeological area is modest,"On the southern slopes of Castle Hill, just 50 meters north of the cathedral's apse, are the remains of a 1st-century Roman theatre. The archaeological area, protected by a roof, is freely visible from above but the remains are very few and if there were not a large panel with the design of the steps, they could hardly be identified as a theatre. Maybe for the locals it has its importance but we Italians are used to many other testimonies of Roman civilization. For those who still want to delve deeper into the site (by paying a modest ticket: three euros which drops to half if you are over 65), the museum also has an exhibition section (entrance on the other side of the road from the archaeological area, in two seventeenth-eighteenth century buildings appropriately adapted to the new museum role and with a view of the Tagus) where stone pieces from the theater are exhibited but also other archaeological evidence from different periods, even prior to that of the theatre, such as the collection of ceramics covering the period from the 4th century BC to the 17th century.",2
,The museum is a dry because there is nothing to do for the kids has history but I already get to school to learn we didn't have any guide for us to show,2
Oh well,The museum starts off quite interestingly with modern aspects but quickly falls back into the last century. The exhibition is interesting but presented very carelessly. The hall with the boats looks much more interesting in photos than they actually are.,2
Disappointed,"Yesterday, first Sunday of March, information on the fact that the museum is free and that is not true!!! Many disappointed people who leave... Updating the information on the internet would be
more than desirable!!! It would be free at 2 p.m., watch out for the clock!!! Really sad!!",1

When I complained, the lady at the shop ( manager) was quite rude. Said nobody had said the handsets were not working & I prob wasn’t pressing buttons hard enough! We had two handsets so kept trying both.

An unfinished and disorganized museum project,"Very weak collection of the alleged Museu do Oriente, limited to three countries and even this one is so poorly represented, when it is known that they have ancient art and cultures. The museums are poorly organized, they don't even have a place to start, nor direction arrows, in that darkness, it looks more like a dark and sad labyrinth. With so much space available, there are collections that are on top of each other, like the paintings on silk manufacturing, and others are repetitive. Some interesting pieces, but sometimes without any numbering or caption of what you are seeing. It started off badly with two photo exhibitions on the entrance floor, with no relation to the East, both very weak, not even worth wasting time on. But does the museum have a curator or someone in charge who sees the pile of negative reviews and does a better job of organizing and subtitling those pieces. I was expecting much more, the culture of the East deserves much more.",2
Opening hours incorrect,It’s not open on a Monday as it states here. Wasted a taxi fare based on Trip Advisor information. All Museums are shut on Mondays in Europe but open weekends.,1
Disappointed,"Disappointed. The museum had several displays about Portugal's not so glorious colonies, one gallery about the Great War and one small room about the Peninsular War against France. Tellingly, there seemed to be only one reference to Wellington and none at all to Beresford, the British CinC of the Portuguese army. The room stewards seemed ignorant and were incapable of answering any questions (in English or Portuguese). They were shabbily dressed and one tall steward appeared to be drunk. The displays were somewhat eclectic and many appeared to be ""fillers"". The impressive marble columns turned out to be painted wood. Very few visitors on the day we went but not value for money.",1
Inform your customers please!?,Said it was open from 2-5 pm on Saturdays. I walked twice around the building and tried every door but it was obviously closed. No signs. Nothing. Nothing mentioned on the website. Awful service. What a disappointment.,1
Ticket Scam once inside,"*BEWARE TICKET SCAM INSIDE*

Bought a ticket from the office they only take cash! €3 good value i thought.

Once inside past the cannon room i was then approached by an older man that came from the direction of the desk in the next room.

The desk is manned and he was speaking with the guy on the desk so all looked normal.

He took my ticket i presumed he worked there he only spoke Portuguese normal ticket checks I presumed.

He then reappeared later on in the museum with a guy now wearing an ID ‘probably fake or provided by a staff member’ i was then asked for my ticket!!

WOW!!!! SCAM!!!!

I said that the older man had taken it! The two both clearly knew each-other. Both had bad English.

This was the worst most obvious scam i have seen!!!
The two were even together!
I think one of the guys weighed me up and thought they had no chance of intimidating me.

I just told the guy with ID that his friend had taken it and they both spoke in Portuguese and i was told ok no problem!

The place only takes cash so wouldn’t of been a bank record to prove it!! I don’t know how deep this scam goes.

This made me uncomfortable and i left missing a large part of the museum out.

Avoid this place and if the museum is reading this you need to investigate your staff as they are conducting criminal activity targeting tourists that have come to see your country!

Especially investigate the guy sitting at the desk after the cannon room!! On 13/07/2023
This guy was speaking to the older man that took my ticket.
The other two are maybe not employees of the museum.

The building is part of the military and there is a military police officer at the main gate opposite the train station, maybe do your job?

I am ex military myself and had been looking forward to this museum for along time.

The place was empty large and very old if you are not very confident or alone this scam could be very intimidating.

Shame on for your pathetic behaviour you criminal scum!!",1
Closed last minute for a strike!!,We walked for nearly an hour from central Lisbon having checked online that the museum was open )8th December) and arrived at 10am. When we arrived we were told that the museum was not going to open today as the staff had decided to strike (which was convenient for them as it was a national holiday). What a waste of time - no notification on Facebook until later in the day.. very poor.,1
Not our thing and very unfriendly,"We received a very unfriendly welcome upon arrival, both at the counter to buy our ticket and the man standing at the entrance itself.
That made us go in with a sour feeling.

Beautiful space and beautifully decorated building where numerous works of art are displayed by type. However, this was not our thing at all, although we like to see (old) art, so we were back outside fairly quickly.
We have seen much nicer places and would certainly not recommend this.",2
Misleading information,"This assessment is based on the terrible information about the schedules on the website. When consulted, it is verified that the museum will be open on December 31. In fact, it offers the possibility of purchasing tickets online for that day. Luckily we didn't. Going to the museum we see that it is closed. This happens to several people who meet at the museum door.",1
Disappointment,"Employee dislike. Investing in friendly, empathetic and cultured employees would be an added value.
Lighting, the spotlights are not well placed, they do not allow full contemplation of the works on display.",2
Don't go.,Very weak museum. Absurd value... 15 euros to see 30 old wagons. There's much better thing to do in Alistou. It's very expensive museum for the money ! Don't waste your money.,1
Be aware,Be aware; the title suggests it may be a museum full of wooden coaches. They are not joking: it is!! Even though it was a day filled with of heavy rain I wish I had stood outside for an hour instead of going in. Please think twice before entering,1
"Not kid friendly, rude staff, AVOID at all costs","Horrible experience! Not kid friendly at all. Staff was incredibly rude yelling at me and my children because my daughter got too close to a display, I promptly asked her to not touch anything, but two very aggressive male employees felt the needed to scream at us as loudly. I have been to museums all over Lisbon, and I’ve never encountered rude staff like this. Avoid this museum at all costs.",1
EMBARRASSING EXCUSE OF A NIGHTCLUB,"EMBARRASSING EXCUSE OF A NIGHTCLUB.
Why did the lady tell us “only allowed in with groups of 4”… bro what does that even mean.
We finally get in at like 12:30 and theres legit 30 people in there…so dead. Dj playing house music with no lyrics. $10 cover money flushed down the toilet. No clue why they were trying to be so exclusive one of the dumbest clubs ive ever been to. NEVER GO TO THIS AWFUL PLACE SO STUPID",1
Discrimination,"Outrageous place. If you're with a group of men, don't go. You stand in line for half an hour and they skip you. After quiet questions, Portuguese come in but others do not.",1
avoid at all costs. awful experience that motivated the creation of this account just to rate this one place poorly,wish I could give this place zero stars. awful and xenophobic bouncers. fueled me to make a trip advisor account just to review them poorly. my friends who got inside said it was dead and awful and terrible and in no way worth the price of entry. go literally anywhere else in the entire country of portugal. avoid at all costs.,1
Racist and aggressive security guards,"We were attacked by security before entering, we ended up in an ambulance on the way to the hospital and formalizing a police report.
This ends a night of partying if you decide to try and enter this place.

I've been inside the bar on other occasions and the staff is no good, in addition to it being a place with a lack of minimum hygiene measures.

Personally, I don't recommend it, there are many other great bars in the area where you wouldn't be mistreated and attacked unnecessarily.",1
Don’t recommend for brown skin.,They didn’t gave entry only because of our brown skin the security guards said it’s . Was very bad experience in my life to decide vocation at Portugal.,1
Racism in Music Box club.,"I went with a friend to music box club yesterday and tried again today. There is strange thing happening, security guard letting white guys to go into club while Asian people were refused to entry. Then we observe for an hour both days ,they refuse to entry to Asian people and giving no reason. When questioned,the security guards was trying to fight and being rude. I email to managers but got no reply. I tried to talk to manager but the guards say ""we are managers"" . All tourists from Europe should stand against racism in this club.",1
Don’t waste your time and money clubbing in Musicbox,"These people should be punished based on their extremely rude behavior and bad service. The bouncer was extremely rude, the receptionist did not have any patience and they did not understand english enough. I do not understand why this club is still up today and running. I am furious about this experience. Don’t go clubbing in Musicbox because they do not know how to treat people with respect. They don’t bother letting you in if you are a tourist but if you are a girl (doesn’t matter if you are a tourist or not) they will let you in 100%. They only care about the men/women ratio because that is their business model.

I thought I was going to die in this club because of how threatening the bouncer was to me when me and my friends entered the club. We got in eventually by paying 12 Euro per person which is really cheap compared to the drama that the receptionist and the bouncer spun up when we entered the club.",1
"Very rude, arrogant and racist","The woman at the door, like the other reviews below, was AWFUL! Bordering on the illegal pretty much for being so obnoxious... the only reason we were there is because Kerala Dust was performing there. Never again...",1
Arrogant blonde lady on the door,"The blonde girl on the door thinks a lot of herself, very rude, condescending and arrogant.

Must enjoy her work",1
horrendous,The would be better if they simply did not exist. They were unfair and unpolite. Bounced us away twice. no explanation. so soo rude,1
Worse club I've been to in my life,"Worst club I've been to. They pretend to make you wait a few minutes in line . There was nobody inside maybe 10 other pissed off people like us. So dead. The use this tactic to charge you a 12€ charge a piece. When we asked the door rude lady ""hi, how long is the wait?"" Her answer"" well you're waiting in line now aren't you ?"" There is a reason why you're so dead, you're rude and you can't sustain this sort of tactic. There's a reason why pensao amore next door has a line down the street and you have a fake line hold when there's only 10 people inside. Work on treating customers with some respect and maybe you can save your failing abysmal sad club",1
Terrible staff,"They treat people like they are animals, all the staff is rude, I don’t recommend, you will find for sure cheaper places with nicer people",1
Dishonest taxi driver from Lisbon Airport,"You’d think that because you’re lining up at a taxi stand at the airport that their services would be legit. Think again.
The wait took about fifteen minutes and I was directed to what seemed like a large suv for one person. When I told the driver which hotel I needed to go, he pulled over to look it up telling me he wasn’t sure where it was. Really? Well the ride took around 15 minutes and during that time I noticed he rested his arm right in the vision of the cab meter which was unusually placed near the gear shift and not in sight of the passenger. This should have raised a red flag for me as legit taxis typically have the meter in clear view. Leaning forward, I noticed a few minutes into the trip the fare read just over five euros. Just before arriving at the hotel the fare was 11.15 euros. But as soon as the driver pulled up he shut the meter off and told me the total was 29 euros. I was tired and jet lagged and against my better judgement chose not to say anything and paid him. Warning others to please pay attention and not get taken advantage of by dishonest taxi drivers here, especially if you are traveling by yourself. The legitimacy of taxi drivers in Lisbon requires re-considering services. Next time I’ll take an Uber.",1
Not Great,"Not nearly as expected. Our tour began by looking at wall tiles from a contemporary artist. After looking at several of those and no hope of seeing better, we made excuses and left. The photo shown in the promo for this tour is what we expected. Fortunately, we also had a 3 hour Tuk Tut tour of the city and our tour guide took us to the LX Factory! We found GREAT street art there.",1
Staff (at checkout/entrance) too stupid!!,"We arrived at 17:16 (the museum closed at 18:00) . We entered to the reception (the guide even put the barrier behind us to indicate that the museum was closing). Once at the checkout, the lady REFUSED to let us in to see the museum although we had the LisboaCard (she didn't have to pay anything and she didn't have to return any change if her checkout was closed and counted). After giving us a look, she showed us her watch (it was then 5:18 pm) and she told us that the last entrance was at 5:15 pm. Really? What was it like for her to let us in when there were 3 other people who passed right in front of us. She told us that we only had access to the shop (to buy a souvenir ... of a place I could not visit!!!) and the backyard to take some pictures. Sincerely, this is exactly the kind of person who should not work with tourists! No kindness!
(and I fully understand that there must be one last admission and closing hours must be respected ... but the guard let us in without saying anything when she pouted) B I T C H",1
Not very exciting,"I found it very disappointing. Not more than one could see in any great museum anywhere! Also, the church, which is apparently very beautiful, closes for lunch before 1pm, so we just browsed a few of the rooms. Not worth the trip if you aren't in that neighborhood.",2
Awful customer service,Ines on reception was extremely rude and would not accommodate us. Would not revisit due to her. We’ve basically been robbed of £30,1
Don’t bother.,"Honestly I’ve been more excited visiting my local tile store in suburban USA than this museum. You’re better off simply walking around Lisbon admiring the tiles on the buildings rather than wasting your time here.
The most interesting part was the very small exhibit showing the substances that were mixed together to make the colors for the tiles. Other than that, there was no context concerning the tiles.",2
Historical tile but hard to understand in English,Had probably expected more and to understand more. Difficult with English info and very old history. Had probably thought it would be with the present. Cheap entrance but had not done it again. Also 25 min über to get there. Drink port instead!,2
Terrible experience!,"Despite having tickets, the museum decided to close last minute for the day without any notice and refund! People were coming and going spending money on taxis with no reason!",1
Animais mantidos em péssimas condições,"Na parte externa, onde ficam as mesas do café, eles mantêm animais presos e em locais sujos. As tartarugas presas em um espaço mínimo, em péssimas condições.",1
Não vale a visita!,"O museu fecha as 12:45 e reabre as 14 hs, vc só fica sabendo sobre o horário quando chega lá! Cheguei as 12:40 , portanto em 5 min o museu fecharia,como o lugar e afastado das demais atrações vc acaba esperando pir sua reabertura,por sorte tem um restaurante,agradável,e e nele que nos resta esperar pela reabertura (detalhe se pir um acaso vc ja estiver dentro do museu os funcionários pedem para que saia e aguarde a reabertura) No museu não há nada de excepcional,em 30 min se tudo (mesmo lendo com paciência sobre a história do azulejo)
Conclusão:não vale a pena.Os funcionários são mau humorados e mesmo observando um bom número de turistas não abrem mão do seu horário de almoço!!",2
The vendor cancelled on us because I asked too many questions.,"We scheduled the tour and needed to arrange the transportation in Lisbon from our VRBO to a meeting point downtown. The guide send a What's App text message saying she had too many travelers to pick up and rerouted our pickup point. It is NOT easy to rearrange transport in Lisbon as a traveler. After several back and forth text messages, they cancelled on us (they did return our money). We then went without them and found there is NO need for this tour - we took the train from downtown and purchased our Sintra tickets online and onsite. I thought they provided transport, tickets and site guides, but they do not. Rick Seves travel books outline what we did. I felt they were rude and unforgiving to the idea we had no idea how to navigate the city ... ended up being quite easy. To be clear: I did not take this tour because they cancelled on me - so perhaps the tour is wonderful.",1
The candle is only to fool,"In the photo of the ad the boat is sailing. On the ride, only engine. I missed the opportunity (maybe the only one in my life) to sail in the Tagus.",2
Below average experience,"Would help if they included the Vasco de Gama bridge and avoided the deserted areas along the shoreline. And please, stick to Portuguese music! Overall, overpriced mediocre experience.",2
disappointed,"We didn't do the ride because it was very cold. the boat was very small and there were many people.
I preferred to stay down",2
Excursion cancelled,"The activity has been cancelled, we would like a refund. We sent an email to get our money back and for now we have no answer...",1
To flee,"Do not choose this airline
They stole 90 euros from us.
We asked for a Friday outing for a couple and a child.
The lady made a mistake and checked us in for Thursday.
They didn't want to know.
It's a shame our child is disappointed and we feel stolen
Choose another airline
It's a tourist catch and they're really not nice because it's the tenth reception that got it wrong
The boat is full to bursting choose another company
Shame on you for not admitting a mistake on your part.
I have the name and a picture of the person who treated us with contempt if the boss or the boss wishes to contact us.",1
Poor refund policy,"Think twice before booking in advance. It rained all day when we were supposed to go with very low visibility, unlike the forecast the day before. I called TripAdvisor and contacted the vendor to see if it was canceled. The vendor said the ship captain would decide 30 minutes in advance and that you had to physically be there to get a refund if it was cancelled. We didn’t waste our time going to the ship, so no refund for us.",1
"Bad experience, bad customer service","Had a disappointing experience, meeting point was wrongly addressed, after finding the right one there was nobody, when contacted the provider I didn't get an answer. After contacting Viator support they told me they will publish a ticket but they didn't, after a week I contacted them again and they apologized for not submitting the ticket and told me its past date to refund and they will ask the provider for refund. Then got email that it was my fault as the location is correct (they changed it in the meantime) and that I cant be refunded. Disgusting.",1
Misleading advertising,"The ""free-flowing"" wine is falsely advertising what in reality is a strict 3 small cups of wine. When I showed the tour woman the wording she went into a rant about how she has to speak 4 languages and isn't a machine, despite her just relaxing when I simply asked is there was more wine. The boat ride itself is pleasant enough, but it was also quite difficult to hear these 4 languages from the guide, so she could have done a bit better. Disappointing really!",2
Disappointed there was no sailing,"We booked this trip for 2:30 on a Sunday. Saturday at 4:30 we were walking past the docks as the sunset sail was leaving. We could not see any sails bent. The boat did not set any sails as they went off down the river. I immediately went to the booth and asked to be issued a refund, if the boat would not be under sail. Since it was 22 hours before our sail and their policy is 24 hours, they refused.

This is advertised as a sailing charter. Look at the photos they post. If the vessel will not be under sail I think they are engaging in false advertising.

All that said, it was a pleasant motor up and down the river but I wouldn’t have booked a traditional sailboat just to be motored around.",2
Wet trip rarely seen,"Had a lot of rain and missed a lot of waves, saw little, trip ended prematurely. Shame. Tour guide indicated that we will get a refund",2
Bad weather,"Trip was canceled. It was our last night in Portugal, we thought it would be so fun, but bad weather prevailed. We are expecting a full refund. Really bummed!",1
Boat stopped working,"Sunset cruise boat could not safely leave the dock area so we had to dock in the emergency area.

Little to no communication during the 30-45 mins of waiting time as to what was happening.

Finally, a representative came to explain that the boat was not safely working but did not offer us a refund. We were told to go back to our third party provider in this case TripAdvisor to ask for a refund. I am now searching up and down the ""help center"" page to find a way to be issued a refund.

Understand that things happen but customer service on making this wrong a right is completely unprofessional.",1
They do not speak Spanish,"The trip was short but very nice, but they promise a guide in Spanish and. Is a lie. They only speak in Portuguese, French and. English. Not a word in Spanish,,,,,,,,,,, Spaniards stick to it.",2
Communication Issues,"We were so frustrated when there is no response when we called on the telephone number for assistance.
We were very closed to the meeting place and to be sure to get to the meeting place on time, we took a taxi. Unfortunately the taxi driver didnot know the place and brought us to somewhere far away to the meeting place. We had an argument with the taxi driver who left us on the street and we were already late. We called on the telephone and nobody answered. We sent a message through Tripadvisor and got no answer.
Very bad communication and disappointing.",2
No reply...,"I made a reservation through Odisseias and didn't get any response, I sent emails to "" Nosso Tejo"", 2 days in a row making endless calls and none were answered.",1
Disappointed,"Booked on strength of good reviews.
We weren’t impressed.
We were unfortunately at the back of the queue and didn’t manage to get seats on the middle benches.
Very uncomfortable narrow wooden ledges to sit on. Left with a very painful back.
Would suggest taking less passengers for their comfort.
Wine was okay. Staff very pleasant.
More information on landmarks would have been good.
Wrap up well as very breezy on the outside seating.",2
Poor Communication,"Unfortunately, we were not advised that there was a rail strike causing traffic to double and triple the normal commute time. There was no one who answer that answered the contact # before or even after the ship had left. We even went to the office which was closed. Knowing that this is a tourist area, an update should have been sent out.",1
Cancellation disappointment,Unfortunately I tested positive to Covid in the hour prior to out trip. I felt well enough to complete the trip but felt it would be irresponsible to put others at risk so we didn’t go. I know it probably misses the refund cancellation period but given we are loyal TripAdvisor and Viator customers I thought we might have been given some slack. We will not be using your services again.,1
Party boat for mature. Not worth it,"Party boat for older people? Not worth it

Hoping for a narrated tour but after a few minutes at the beginning it was very quiet, apart from the cheesy 80's hits being pushed out.
Went past lots of interesting places but no clue what they were? Would have been much more worth it having more chat about things we passed, especially coming back on the other side of the river.
3 cups of cheap white wine didn't help.
Just felt a great opportunity missed and being treated like 18 year olds on a party boat not great. At £31 each definitely not cheap either. Most disappointing.
It may suit some but I cannot recommend this for others",2
Promenade en bateau,Déçu les images ne correspondent pas à la réalité. Voilier à moteur .Pas de voiles.parcours de 2h.35 euros la personne trop cher pour la prestation. Surprise ratée !!!Pour ce type de prestation la moitié du prix et du temps serait correcte et images réels.,2
"Croisière annulée, dommage!","Impossible de noter la balade en bateau.

Il nous indiqué que Tripadvisor avait été prévenu de l anulation et que nous devions nous adresser à vous pour un remboursement..",2
Not as advertized,"We booked for a ride on a sailboat and it turn out to be a motor boat. The captain claimed the sails were being repaired. When we returned to dock the

THE EXPERIENCE DIDN’T EXIST,"THE EXPERIENCE DIDN’T EXIST .
We have arrived and no boat was available at the time scheduled. There wasn’t any experience available and I had to improvise a corporate agenda. Everyone was extremely disappointed. 11 people waiting to have this experience. This is unacceptable and unprofessional from Tripadvisor. Please let me know how to get the refund.",1
Not Great!,"Calling it an ""Average"" experience is being pretty generous.

There was a boat, there was a sunset, and there was white wine.

BUT - The boat was so crowded - packed in like sardines to sit on hard bench seats for 2 hours, this was not any where near an enjoyable/comfortable excursion.
The commentary identifying what we were seeing was very limited.
The wine which is described as ""free flowing"" was even more limited - half a paper cup in the first hour on the way out, and a second half cup in the second hour on the way back - certainly not my idea of ""free flowing"".
View, and opportunity to photograph the sunset was limited due to crowding.",2
Disappointing trip,"Disappointing trip. Boat was a little small for the amount of people so we were all squeezed in. The commentary was unintelligible as the guide spoke so fast- she was rattling through it in 4 languages which all merged together. Despite a beautiful breeze no attempt was made to put the sails up so the engine was on all the time.
However it was nice to be on the water and we saw some dolphins which was a bonus.",2
Beware if you are offered a bar tab,My second time here. No issues on the first night. Good music both nights. Was offered a tab on the second night which I agreed to. When I went to leave I got the bill which was way over what we had consumed. I wasn't in the place long enough for this. When I questioned this I was completely ignored and the staff were not a bit pleasant. I paid and left and most definitely I won't be back. A single error can happen but this way beyond that,1
Joke,"Absolutely disgusting service ordered 5 meals and it took an hour to get it right.false advertising showing celtic games ...they don't show them

Being seated next to the toilet on a very small table with my daughter. Not prepared to spend in excess of 50 euro,Not happy being seated next to the toilet on a small table for my dinner with my daughter. Put a shadow on the few visits we made here during the week. Wouldn’t recommend,1
Pub Doorman stamped on customers head.,"Don’t go here late into the evening.

Security on the door dragged a man out who was resisting but at the same time wasn’t causing harm to anyone as he was too drunk to do anything.

Security had him on the ground and punched him in the head before lifting his foot and stamping down on the guys head as hard as he could.

Guy was out cold and wouldn’t be surprised if he has permanent damage.

To make things worse, the security guard then took pride in it and started to puff his chest out and ask customers if they saw what happened
Avoid at all costs",1
Watered down drinks,We came to his pub on our first night in Lisbon and we had a really good night. We also arrived there on our last night and we ordered cocktails but we noticed as time went on some of them were missing alcohol even though we paid 9 euro. When it was said to them they added the alcohol which in that case it leads me to believe they were ripping us off when they thought we wouldn't notice.,1
Nothing much,Classic Irish pub located near Lisbon's riverside. Internally poorly maintained with hasty and not very helpful service. Quality of food not up to similar venues and beers served not very cold,2
That's not right! Every guest should be treated equally!,"We sat down at a table and waited
to get a menu. It never arrived and we had to get our beers from the bar ourselves. Service at the bar was friendly but we couldn't order anything to eat at the table and we couldn't reorder drinks either. Unfortunately it was different at other tables... why? Aren't all guests the same? We're used to a different (better, nicer) service from an Irish pub! The door to the ladies' room was also covered with a poster and couldn't be found. When I asked, I just got a strange look and a finger pointing to the relevant door. Not acceptable! We didn't feel welcome!!",1
No need to go there,There wasn’t anything good exept the service. There was a young women who did her job perfectly! But food was terrible and the place didn’t seem like a irish pub.,2
Indian Irish pub,This is a sham of an Irish Bar. It is run by Indian Nationals who have no inclination of Irish Culture. It may appear lively but you will be treated as you were in McDonald’s as you are just a punter. You will be ushered off your seat to make room for standing customers to fit more in. Security are rude and heavy handed with people who do not drink enough. Avoid this pub and stick to the locals for authenticity.,1
Agressive and homophobic security guard at the door,"On the 28th of January this year, a group of friends and I went to the pub. It's usually a great place to hang out with music and a few beers. This time, however, we were met at the door by a tall, bald and rude security guard. We said hello and were about to walk in when he suddenly stood in front of the doorway without looking at us and remained silent. We asked if we could come in and he said ""So you arrive somewhere and don't say hello to the security guard?"", to which we replied that we already did so. He moved up close to us and asked two guys in the group ""vocês as duas também vão entrar?"" [will you two (female form) be going in too?]. This was his notion of a smart wordplay to imply they were gay? No one in the group is in fact but it made us wonder how many LGBT people felt disturbed by this sinister behavior.
We went inside the bar and it was too crowded (way more than it should) so we left after discussing all that happened. As we got outside he was giving the next group of people the same talk that we got and being aggressive and hostile for no reason whatsoever.
You guys usually have a terrific environment, you have awesome bar staff and employees from all over the world, and you even display a Ukrainian flag and show some social awareness. Don't take this lightly.
The bar needs to take responsibility for the people it is employing for security as well. Having a frustrated, homophobic individual guarding the door leaves a terrible first impression.",1
Over priced spirits....,"Popped in here for a drink & it cost 20 euros for a double gin & lemonade! I get that's it probably imported, but that's just ridiculous. Needless to say I'm glad I didn't ask for another!!",2
Way over rated !,"It was so so.... Definitely not the best aquarium I have visited. A lot of space wasted for very small fish that you can see anywhere. A lot of stairs, elevators, ridiculously small for the amount of people. Only 2 cashier's wording during peak season at peak time. (Not too smart)
Very expensive for what it is.",2
Disappointment,"Drawn by the fame of this aquarium, we put it among the stops of our trip to Lisbon, having a child in our group.
The aquarium is structured on several floors, but they made a questionable choice: in fact, the key element of the exhibition is a large central tank visible from several sides and from each floor, with virtually all the breeds present in the aquarium.
Beautiful and scenic effect in itself, but impractical for the purpose of the visit.
For the rest there are few fish tanks, 2 penguins on the cross and the otter tank.
We had a different expectation that was dashed.
We re-evaluated the one in Genoa, which is certainly smaller, but at least has more variety and interaction.
It was a big disappointment. (expensive ticket for what we saw).",2
Overcrowded,"Beautiful fish, but restricted space and very few species other than fish, two otters and a guillemot or two. The actual viewing tanks are very clear, but the day we visited the overcrowding was dreadful and the noise of adults and children deafening at times. Entry is by half hour slots if you pre-book (advisable). We visited on a weekday before school holidays began, so heaven knows what it must be like during school holidays in August. There appears to be no limits set on numbers as far as we could see. It was over all an uncomfortable experience.",2
Big Letdown,"The fish tanks are beautiful, clear, clean, and well labelled. But basically you just look at fish tanks over and over. So many fish tanks.

Other than a few birds and two otters, there were no other sea creatures on exhibit (seals, penguins, sea turtles, sea horses, and other sea life were all conspicuously absent). There was one disjointed short film about the sea. Otherwise it was just fish tank after fish tank.

Overall boring. No cohesive theme. Took less than 45 minutes for the whole thing. There was an overpriced gift shop, natch. Not worth €25 per person.",2
Overcrowded and misinformed,"We went specifically to see the mola mola (ocean sunfish), but we were here to be dissappointed. The fish was heavily advertised but seemed to have died a while ago. We had to ask the staff to figure this out. It was heavily overcrowded and hard to see the animals. because of this.

On a positive note: the otters and manta rays were cool to see",2
Oceanário de Lisboa,"Been here on a Friday morning and we didn't have to queue. So we thought it wasn't too crowded. Nothing could be further from the truth. There were far too many groups of schoolchildren in a row where you could wonder who were louder: the children or the counselors. The counselors tried to keep the children quiet; without success. Result: constant noise of screaming children, children running around and crawling in front. In this way we looked at the animals as quickly as possible to get ahead of the large groups. Let the groups of schoolchildren per group in every 15 minutes and have the staff keep an eye on them inside and you have divided the crowds a bit.

About Oceanário de Lisboa itself:

This aquarium was a bit disappointing. Not only because of the aforementioned, but it also felt a bit small! There is a huge tank in the middle in which you can admire a different kind of animals from different heights (there are two floors). In the two circles you walk you will find even smaller spaces with other animals and also a tropical rainforest.

It was very beautiful, but it was all just not. I felt there were few animals, little time to take a good look at everything because of the crowds and we were ready within an hour and a half, so not three/four hours which many here indicate.

I personally liked Oceanogràfic in Valencia much better!",2
Overrated,"Unfortunately, we have been to the aquarium in Atlanta Georgia, so after that, the Lisbon aquarium left us very unimpressed. We were especially disappointed because of the buildup, but perhaps that’s the only or the best. The good reviewers have experienced.",2
Disappointing experience – Expensive and overcrowded,"We visited the Lisbon Oceanarium with many expectations, but unfortunately they were not fulfilled. We arrived around 11:00 in the morning and encountered long queues, despite our entries indicating ""queueless access"". The first available slot was at 13:30, and finally we entered around 14:00 because of the number of people.

The main aquarium is relatively small compared to others we have visited, and although well designed, it falls short in variety. One of the great attractions, mola mola (sunfish), was quarantined and could not be seen. In addition, the Antarctic area was also closed, which was a great disappointment as it is one of the most special exhibitions.

For the ticket price, we expected a more complete and better organized experience. With so many enclosed areas and so much waiting, we found it expensive and not worth it.

Council: If you still decide to go, buy tickets well in advance and go as early as possible to avoid the worst queues.",2
Underwhelming Experience – Overpriced and Overcrowded,"We visited the Lisbon Oceanarium with high expectations, but unfortunately, it didn’t live up to the hype. We arrived around 11:00 AM, only to find long queues despite our ticket saying ""Skip the line."" The earliest entry slot we could get was for 1:30 PM, and we only got in around 2:00 PM due to the crowds.

The main tank is relatively small compared to other aquariums we’ve visited, and although it’s beautifully designed, it felt limited in terms of variety. One of the main highlights, the mola mola (sunfish), was in quarantine and not visible. The Antarctic section was also closed, which was a big disappointment, especially since that’s one of the more unique displays.

For the price of admission, we expected a more complete and smoothly run experience. With so many closures and delays, it felt overpriced and not worth it.

Tip: If you still decide to go, buy tickets well in advance, and try to go right when it opens to avoid the worst of the lines.",2
Avoid. Extremely crowded. Not worth the time and money,"Extremely overpriced with 25 euros per person above the age of 13. Entrance is chaotic with extremely long queues even when you buy your ticket online in advance. The guards at the entrance 1) arr clueless, 2) speak only Portuguese and 3) are chaotic as they send you from one queue to another queue with zero idea about which queue is waiting for what type of entrance. What you get for your overpriced tickets is ridiculous. A central aquarium with windows looking at it from different directions where crowds are in long queues just to ger a peek. They let in far too many people for the actual capacity of the place. 2 points max out of 10 points. Not impressive at all. Especially for this exaggerated ticket price. Avoid.",1
Disappointing,"Queuing system was terrible. Purchased ticket online with the promise of skipping the line, but this didn't happen. Far too busy. No overhead views as seen in other Aquariums. It was over too quickly.",1
Dear for what it is,"Dear for what it is. A large pool in the middle and around the mini windows.
Not worth the Monaco or Nausicaa aquarium in northern France",2
Disappointed with our visit,"It is expensive for this place. The central basin is indeed giant, but everything is focused around it wherever you are.
I find the price is not justified even if it is very well maintained.",2
Underwhelming,"One big tank (very full with many different fish) but was very busy (you can see it from different angles along the way which wasn’t originally said.

A lot of little other tanks.

The whole experience was very underwhelming and i wouldn’t recommend.",2
Under-Whelming Ocean Life !,"1 star, very underwhelming and definitely does not portray much for real
Ocean life. Two otters, some fish, some sharks and sea life.
Short film in the small viewing room with seats was highlight cause we took a nap.
Location is out of the way and no other tourist attraction in the area.
We also did the old Expo Telecabine Cable car, another disappointment.

Epic fail for Tourist !!",1
Does not match 1 ranking,"First place in the ranking it does not correspond to exactly , the exposure is very small , marine animals are few , no penguins , non-reptiles non-seabirds , jellyfish are half-dead, it is 10 times smaller than in Valencia , do not recommend to visit",1
Very disappointing,Entrance is very expensive and the price is not justified: we quickly went around and the cramped spaces do not allow you to see well (often difficult to access the windows to see qqch). It may be the largest aquarium in Europe but we had a more interesting and pleasant experience in La Rochelle (better managed spaces to circulate and observe).,2
Too expensive for the service,"Far too expensive. What family can put 100 euros for a visit?
Everything is focused on the central basin with sharks in particular. Around small insignificant basins with clown fish and anemones
In short, go your way if you hesitate to go
For doing Nausica in the north of France, well I am disappointed",2
IT GETS BETTER,"The structure is nice , but honestly 25 euros is really too much for what you see . I do not recommend if of high expectations. Parking not easy.",2
It's not worth it.,"admission to 25 euros for adults and 15 for children up to 12 years.... well it is absolutely not worth the money spent. there is only one large central tank where you go around it throughout the route and is surrounded by other small tanks, all for a ride that can last a maximum of an hour and a half unless you stop in front of the main tank for hours to pass the time. I repeat the price is really too high compared to what is offered",2
No more.,"Full of people, it's not well organized, if you leave clothes in lockers, then since you don't end up there, you have to go back. Much better Gijón's.",2
"Underwhelming, not worth it","Went here on a discount for the ‘Blue Moon’ for €15.-

To be fair, it is very underwheming, there is one tank in the middle with a 360* viewingangle, and a few small tanks. The expositions where empty and the exposition was in a small room.

ALOT of kids, without supervision in any sense. Very annoying, not worth it.",2
Too busy,Too busy to see anything. They let far too many people in to the point it’s almost impossible to get close to anything with a family. See the photo which was pretty much the same at most viewing areas. At 80E for a family this makes it hugely expensive too. Even without the crowds there are much better aquariums.,2
25 euros for that? No,"Frankly 25 euros for a nice film, some aquariums very difficult to approach with the clumped world and a small exhibition upstairs is very expensive for the visit.
Very disappointed with what looks like a small scam well wrapped...",2
Scam,I booked the visit and was never sent tickets. I had to purchase on site and tickets were much cheaper. I requested a refund and am waiting for the response,1
Poor experience for disabled family,"Extraordinarily overcrowded during our visit. We brought our young disabled daughter and she got to see nearly nothing. It was quite upsetting, as other visitors pushed in front of us and prevented her from getting to the front of a single tank. Able-bodied users used the disabled lifts, causing additional congestion. Staff tried to help when they saw us being pushed around (Literally, I've never had this experience at anything) but we still didn't get the chance to view much of anything. I've heard great things about this aquarium but this was honestly a really unpleasant and difficult day. I guess I could only suggest asking locals when it might be quietest? We went today, a Wednesday in October.",2
Visit to the Lisbon Oceanarium,"Although the Oceanarium is a spectacular and magical place, with a diversity of fascinating animals that really impress, the experience was disappointing. The number of people inside the space was absurd, making it impossible to observe the animals clearly and enjoy the visit calmly. At certain times, it was difficult to even walk, which made the ride boring and frustrating.
Considering the high ticket price, I expected a more organized and comfortable experience.
I just don’t give a lower review because, in fact, the animals are amazing and deserve to be seen, but the overcrowding completely compromised the experience.",2
Unfortunate treatment of the manager,"Beware of these people take advantage of the tourists, I had a problem with the tickets and they were going to give me a return.... I keep waiting, they're all excuses, bad treatment of the staff a shameless.",1
Bof,Aquarium more than mediocre. A big pool in the middle where there is a diversity of fish and the rest zero. Small aquariums with 3/4 fish fighting in a duel. In addition it is indicated that it takes about 3 hours to visit the aquarium. Make it in 1:15. Avoid for 25 euros per person,2
Worst experience ever!,"Worst experience ever!!! Animals and aquarium very well treated, however quantity of people on site makes the experience terrible and without the possibility of doing what we paid, living is enjoying the marine life!!",1
Mediocre,"Nothing much, taking into account the cost of the ticket and the impossibility of finding the parking lot on August 12, 2024, since the only parking space indicated as theirs was fully booked. So we had purchased tickets online and had nowhere to park. We lost 1 hour searching and turning along the streets, congratulations on the organization.",1
Unfortunate treatment.,"They told us that we had to leave after we had bought the tickets and inform them that we carry a chihuahua in a backpack, first they tell us that without problem and after buying the tickets they kick us out... I asked for the return of the tickets and I still wait for the money back after a month... bad organization some say yes and others do not... above all they leave us as liars.... They gave us a hard time.
Nefarious treatment... AND I WANT MY RETURN NOW.!!!",1
Shame,Too expensive family of 4 paid more than 100 euros.........................................................................,1
Weak,"horrible , very bad layout , almost not to see anything , we always see the same animals but from different sites , does not pay anything, especially for 25€",1
Waste of time/money/potential,"Waaaaaaaaaay too crowded, way to expensive, and the whole was thing was done in 35 minutes. The best thing was the Japanese exhibition and even that was underwhelming.",2
What could have been a mediocre experience made worse by overcrowding and an absence of transport.,"This is way out of the centre of town so you have to get a taxi to it. There’s no obvious place for taxis to wait so you are left stranded hoping for a taxi that has just dropped someone off nearby to get back.

They let in about 3 times too many people as should have been allowed in and it was more like being in a packed tube train than a fun or educational experience.

They have one central tank with various places you can look in past crowds of people and a very small number of tanks with other creatures but with so many people there it was impossible to tell. After suffering about 20 minutes of this we made our escape and finally made it out after 30 minutes for 25€ each. For a similar experience walk up and down the aisle of a bus during peak commuting hours wearing a blindfold.

The London, Singapore and Valencia aquariums are much better. As an experience, the aquariums at Chessington or Brighton are better.",1
To be avoided. Disorganization and disrespect for visitors.,Too many visitors made visiting for adults torturous and impossible for children. I thought that as they announce visiting hours there would be a break in the entry of visitors and therefore space during the visit. This was not happening with people constantly coming in with absolute chaos inside and crowds of people in front of each aquarium. Horrible and certainly dangerous in terms of safety.,1
"Not recommended, overpriced and overcrowded","Overcrowded and overpriced, not much special to see. Disappointing for everyone. It was just a crowd and no one could even get close to the aquariums. The entrance fee is ridiculous in comparison.",1
Not so great,"After what kind of publicity this place had, I expected something out of the ordinary.
In fact , it wasn't that great, at least not for me. It was way too crowded and there were a lot of things I didn't see because of that. There weren't much expositions, it was one large tank and more places to look at it.
I've definitely seen better aquariums and I am not sure if I should recommend this.",2
"Okay aquarium, WAY too many people","We had bought tickets online to avoid a long queue. When we arrived there was a really long queue, and after asking around a bit, we found out that the very long queue was actually for those who had bought tickets in advance. It kind of took the excitement out of going in and seeing the aquarium. With 2 children, we were about to give up already there, but the tickets had been bought, so we waited. It turned out that there was only a single scanned ticket at the entrance, and with a queue several 100 m long, it's just not good enough. The aquarium was ok, and the large tank was nice and you could see in from many different sides, you walk around the large aquarium during most of the visit. But the crowd and the large groups on guided tours, made it really difficult to enjoy it and take the time to see it all.
Okay aquarium, but the ones we have in Denmark can compare well with this and the amount of people, and large groups, means that we will not come again.",2
Not impressed,"Very not worth the price,
Don't visit on raining days as its so full with people that it is a horrible experience.
Don't buy online tickets until you are at the door, the line for o line tickets was over 100m long and the buy the tickets line was 20m. I blame management for the very slow pace of the online ticket line. A tip is to wait to buy the online ticket until you are at the door, also ignore the time slot on the online tickets it is not relevant.
About the exposition I have seen better at cheeper price's, honestly not impressed but disappointed for the ticket price, also the gift shop disappointing and very expensive..",2
Failed Visit of Oceanarium Lisbon - memorable negative experience,"Incredibly bad organisation today 11h45, selling too many tickets with restricted number of access, waiting with baby in heavy weather & rain conditions, long waiting lines of approx. 50 m. outside without willing to give priority to family with 18 months old baby,no information from staff on realistic prognostics to get access into oceanarium, have bought tickets online during morning and finally/luckily then succeeded to give these back asking for respective credit, looks like having quite a big margin to improve organization and as well communication of some staff with customers in Oceanarium Lisbon.",1
It could be better,"Given that I don't like aquariums in general and knowing those poor fish closed in a tank, albeit a giant one, this one in Lisbon is nothing special: there are bigger and more beautiful oceanariums around.
No spectacular scenography:
at a certain point my daughter even got bored. The peculiarity is being able to combine the cableway ride.",2
Impudence,"It is a mystery to me why this aquarium is so highly praised, even in travel guides. I think they work together, have to write it, probably get a piece of the big pie, which at €25 per adult is simply too high for what is on offer there. The only attraction is the sea otter, really funny, otherwise a large pool in the middle with lots of windows, cleverly distributed so that you think there are different pools.
Really sad, you can get through it in an hour, then you can watch a film about a surfer boy who thinks that just because he surfs the whole world has to save the ocean, it would be better to let the animals go free then we will have achieved something.
By the way, the people in charge at the aquarium in Palma Mallorca could find out how it really works, especially the 3D show about the whales, sensational!!!",1
It could be better,"Perplexed, I read reviews about one of the largest aquariums in the world, a unique experience.....but where have you been, I wonder, have you visited the aquarium of Genoa, or the aquarium of Tenerife, perhaps it is better to save your money for the complete free tours which are fascinating and interesting? cheap aquarium rating 4 but only because I'm good, educational room video bellina na forsr a backrest seat?????in the Canary Islands steps in an aquarium tunnel",2
You have better things to do!,"So where to start ?
Don't go there!!
It's a beast 360° aquarium, which brings together fish, rays, sharks without anything exceptional... As you go around you will see two otters, a few penguins, two frogs and there you have it...
The only exceptional thing about this aquarium is the 25€/person at the entrance, which means that for this price there are much better things to do.
I strongly advise you not to go there!!
We were very disappointed with this aquarium and the maintenance of it, children fell in front of us because it was raining in the aquarium...
Not to mention the prices of stuffed animals at the store...",2
Scam promotion,"There was a promotion from November 25th to December 1st! I went to the site this morning, December 1st, and it never let me complete the purchase. Suddenly in the afternoon the promotion disappeared. You could write that the tickets are sold out…. But instead without promotion you can buy it. It is a scam!!! It's not for the extra 20 euros. It is a question of principle and loyalty.",1
Lost time,"Lost time
Small aquarium with a few different types of animals, all the fish concentrated in a single tank without explanations and illustrations to understand what you are seeing.
€25 wasted",1
The price is too high,"50€ for two, compared to other zoos I have been to, it is quite small with fewer different species.
The “penguins” look really sad, with pieces of plastic that serve as their wings and prevent them from flying. They have trouble swimming and walking, it’s super sad.
For the price, size and one-armed space, it's not worth it. The store is pretty and the stuffed animals are really beautiful.",2
Way too overcrowded!,We were really looking forward to visiting with our baby but it was far too overcrowded to enjoy unfortunately. Over 30 mins queue to get in even though we had pre booked tickets with a specific time slot and then it was almost impossible to move around in the aquarium or get close to any of the tanks as there were so many people crowded in. They need to limit the numbers allowed in at one time.,2
Very disappointing,"The visit turned out to be very disappointing, we were unable to enjoy our visit because there were so many people (children screaming and running everywhere). The aquarium is expensive (25€/person) for what it offers: a central pool and small aquariums seen from different angles.
Go your way.",2
Could t wait to fine the exit,"Warning! The things you don’t know before you go in is most of this is dark and extremely crowded. People, strollers, backpacks jostling in small spaces to peer into small aquarium windows. Some aquariums are larger and some displays in the light. It mostly it is very dark and jammed. together. I was In a panic to get out and I am Not usually that claustrophobic",1
Overcrowded,"The offer of reduced tickets (€7.50 instead of €25) during the month of September is of course going to attract lots of visitors, but the staff have done nothing to prevent overcrowding. There are two time slots, 5pm and 6pm. When we arrived early at 5:30, we asked where we would need to queue for the 6pm entry, and a member of staff said we could go straight in and the time slot didn’t matter. So there was no attempt to manage numbers. As a result, it was difficult to see many of the beautiful fish/animals without having to queue or being pushed up against lots of people. They need to keep to the time slots but also establish a capacity limit for the aquarium during September. It spoils the experience for everyone, especially for vulnerable people i.e. disabled, elderly, neurodivergent or those who suffer from claustrophobia/social anxiety.",2
Not worth it,"This aquarium is certainly very beautiful, but when we visited other aquariums like the one in Montpellier, these ones are a little larger but almost identical. We regretted our visit.",1
VERY EXPENSIVE TICKETS!,"It's very sad for a family of 4 to want to visit the Oceanarium and have to pay €95 to enter!
During the visit I also missed someone who could provide some clarification from time to time.",1
"So many people, to the point of not seeing anything in the end, at 130€ for us it hurts.","It was so crowded that you couldn't even get close to the windows. At 130€ for the 6 of us, which remains reasonable, not being able to see anything remains a big disappointment.",1
A Waste of Time and Money..,"It may be the biggest, but it was the worst we have ever been. More of a learning center for Grade School Children. Don't wast we your money.",1
Null,"Honestly, I'm a fan of the aquarium (La Rochelle St Malo..)
And ba c de la…and I’m nice
A large central aquarium where you can walk around...3 frogs fighting a duel
And all that for 25€
C abused
Disappointed 😢",1
Good but disappointing,"Everything was incredible, the animals and the environment itself, but I can't help but highlight that taking children (babies) who will never remember the visit is simply useless and disturbing for everything and everyone, people don't respect each other passing by each other. on top of others and stepping on them if it's just shameful as the Lisbon oceanarium continues without any percussion and with prices of 25 euros per person on an excursion that ends in less than 1 hour and even less if there are too many people hungry to see animals. ...",2
Service Dogs Banned,I arrived with my service dog and was originally granted access. However as I attempted to enter the exhibition areas I was stopped and advised that even service dogs were not permitted. I pointed out that banning service dogs was illegal but the organisers continued to say No insisting that as in some areas birds were flying around and that therefore my dog might get upset or he might upset the birds. I pointed out that I would put him a fully sealed buggy and that consequently access to him or him to birds was impossible but still was refused entry. In the event there was only one area where birds were flying around and in all other areas neither my service dog or their animals could reach or upset each other.,1
Décevant,"J’essaie d’être le plus objectif possible mais difficile quand nous avons été très déçus. Il y a un bassin central et l’on tourne autour tout au long de la visite, quelques aquarium annexes et somme toute très petits. Une otarie nage seule dans un aquarium trop petit pour elle. Deux ambiances (polaire, tropicales) s’enchaînent sans vraie logique et avec très, trop peu d’espèces. Nous avons visité plusieurs aquariums et quand nous avons lu que c’était le 2eme d’Europe et lues les notes nous étions plein d’espoir. Il ne vaut pas, selon moi, sa réputation. Cet avis est aussi lié au fait que lorsque que l’on paie 88€ pour une famille (22€/personne), la déception est d’autant plus grande.",1
WAY too crowded,Beautiful aquarium but WAY too many people are allowed in at the same time. Very hard to enjoy the exhibitions in such a crowded environment.,2
Décevant,"Visite entre amis de l'aquarium
Très cher pour ce que c'est.
OK bassin important autour duquel on circule mais très décevant au final !
Passez votre chemin !",1
O passeio mais triste de Lisboa,"Horrível. Animais tristes e dopados. Lamentável estrutura. Luz artificial, água e plantas artificiais. Mais uma triste atração de exploração animal, com mentira sobre preservação e sustentabilidade. Não recomendo de todo!!",1
Bom para visitar em horas vagas,"Já visitei o oceanário mais de 4 vezes durante a minha vida.Mas desta vez devo dizer que correu mal. Visitei o Oceanário num Domingo e devo dizer que foi das piores experiências que tive. Não há qualquer controlo do número de pessoas que visitam o oceanário. Era impossível observar os peixes em qualquer lugar porque estava sempre sobrelotado e bastante calor e abafado. E além do espaço começar a evidenciar a degradação normal do tempo é surreal deixarem entrar as pessoas com comida porque era bocados de comida espalhadas por todo o lado. Adoro o oceanário, mas sinto que mandei os bilhetes para o lixo porque não disfrutei nada.",2
Passez votre chemin,"Les loutres n'étaient pas présentes, le bassin est vide. Nous sommes vraiment dégoûtés de ne pas avoir vu ces petites mascottes.
Aquarium avec peu de spécimens. 1 très grand bassin que l'on peut voir sur plusieurs étages et avec différents points de vue - les espèces sont donc les mêmes tout au long de la visite.
Quelques petits bassins annexes avec des poissons différents selon le continent.
Plusieurs endroits pour s'asseoir ce qui est agréable.
Plusieurs toilettes+espace change bébé. Accessible aux familles en poussette .
Beaucoup trop cher pour ce qui est proposé.",2
Triste,"Péssima experiência. Comprei os bilhetes online com antecedência, paguei na hora, pensando que seria mais fácil e rápido pois evitava filas e perdas de tempo desnecessário. Mas ao entrar na fila de bilhetes online, e ao fazerem scan depararam-se com um erro que não assumia os dois bilhetes, que nos levou meia hora do nosso tempo para tentar perceber o problema e outra meia hora para tentar resolvê-lo. Ninguém me conseguiu explicar o porquê, e com muita sorte deixaram-nos entrar. A não repetir e a não aconselhar.",1
Don’t waste your time,"Carnaval parade is lesse crowded than this place. Barely could see any animal. If they limited the amount of visitor by half, it would still be too much.",1
Deludente,"In una zona dismessa, quello che viene indicato come l’acquario più grande d’Europa risulta piuttosto deludente e non regge il confronto con gli acquari di Genova e Valencia.
A parte la grande vasca centrale (molto bella) c è poco altro e si continua a girare li intorno. Lo consiglio solo in caso di brutta giornata.",2
Highly overrated. Sunfish is gone.,"App doesn’t work, restaurant food tastes horrible, the main movie exhibit is in Portuguese with no English subtitles, staff are basically nonexistent with children free to bash on the tank glass, and the main attraction I came to see (the sunfish) is missing with a vague explanation by staff that it was “in quarantine”. Frankly shocked that this aquarium is so highly reviewed. I would recommend spending your time in Portugal elsewhere. Very disappointed.",1
Não voltarei a repetir a visita,"Impossível ver os aquários. Nem sequer estamos a falar em ver com atenção, ler as notas explicativas dos animais... Foi tudo! Era impossível andar e chegarmos perto das atrações.
Com muita pena, não voltarei a repetir a visita.",1
No crowd control,"It was extremely crowded inside. Took about 20 minutes to get through the door the line was long. Once inside, most people crowded around the exhibit and did not make room for others. I was pushed a few times from seeing the animals. Native people seemed to have poor attitudes to travelers. I was not impressed by the exhibits. Otter was cute but that’s all.",2
Delusione,"Preparatevi a una delusione. Se questo è l'acquario più grande d'Europa, io sono Jack Sparrow. Piccolo, povero e costoso. È più grande il gift shop di tutto il resto.",1
Bad,"Otras, nikdy viac. Najhoršie aqua v akom som kedy bola. Špinavé, prepchaté ľuďmi, tlačia sa aj s kočíkmi všetci okolo, vôbec nekorigujú počet návštevníkov. Za 22€ na osobu vyhodené peniaze.",2
Péssima experiência,Comprei o bilhete com desconto e a promoção dizia “100% da experiência” aquilo estava tão cheio que nem dava para chegar perto dos aquários. Não limitaram o número de ingressos. A filha para entrar demorou mais de meia hora. Pessimo! Fazem promoções assim mas não limitam o número de ingressos.,1
Passez votre chemin !,"Très décevant ! Pour être le deuxième plus grand aquarium d'Europe je m'attendais à plus grand, le circuit se déroule autour du même aquarium central. Pas de tunnel ! Un seul gros requin, pas de tortue ! Ticket cher pour ce que c'est, durée d'une heure. Le seule point positif sont les loutres",2
Very poor/almost nonexistent customer service.,"Customer service didn’t work well: I had a pack that was going to expire. We marked on the website before the expiry date and gave to mark. However, by phone contact with the experience company, we were told that we would not accept the voucher and to call the Odyssey to request extension.

Well, the computer system that Odyssey has has served nothing, neither to prevent a supposed marking that is not valid, nor to let cancel, remarket or extend.

We send an email explaining the situation so that we can extend and use the package. They simply told us that it was already marked and that it did not, seeming to completely ignore what happened. Either that, or it was a robot responding or lack of will.

By phone, they do not answer (and still automatically say that waiting time is 2 minutes) and after about 6 minutes the call turns off to ask to call later, without the possibility of leaving a number.

Customer service is really bad! No advice!",1

"Feedback on Recent Experience To Sintra, Pena Palace and Cascais","I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience with your service. Regrettably, it was mediocre overall, and not a very pleasant experience.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this service to anyone, and I will not be booking with you in the future.",1
Terrible experience,"I booked this trip because it had 5 star reviews...not sure how this can be rated 5 stars after my experience. I booked the day trip to Sintra, Pena Palace and Cascais. Our driver, yes I am going to call him a driver as he was not in any way a tour guide. There was no commentary, just pick up, dropped us at Sintra, told us what time to meet him at the van and that was it. No explanation of what we were seeing, why Sintra was special and what we should see in the 1.5 hours there. The same experience was repeated at Pena Palace, dropped at front gate, and told to come back in 2.5 hours...again no explanation of the history, what were we seeing etc.. Then we go to a beach for a photo stop, no explanation, then onto Cascais, again not told what we should see there, what was special etc... There was literally no interaction from the driver that was supposed to be a guide. There were 7 in the group and we all felt the same way. Considering we all paid £80 per head, that is £560 for the day, this was the most overpriced service for a ""driver"". We wanted a guide, not a driver...not impressed and don't recommend this company..",1
Customer service 0,Hang up the phone when i told her in portugees my english is better... weird service for a store not what im used to for a client,1
"Don't book directly through their site, even if they ask you to","We found this tour on AirBnb experiences and reached out to book this tour, which sounded absolutely wonderful based on the reviews. We were asked by the owner to leave the AirBnB site and book directly through them instead since they only opened certain slots to AirBnB customers. So that's what we did, trusting that the tours were verified. An unfortunate series of weather and airline events led our trip to have to be postponed by a few days and we asked whether we could move our tour to a different day or refunded, but the owner refused. The company's policy is quite strict for cancellations; unlike the AirBnB policy which would have issued us a full refund for the tour with 24 hours notice. I had a few exchanges with the owner and received an angry and unprofessional reply. So we lost over $170 and never had the opportunity to enjoy this lovely tour. My recommendation to other travelers is to book through a 3rd party like AirBnB because there are more protections for the consumer and recourse in case there's an issue. Had we known this would have happened, we would have booked with a different company on AirBnB.",1
,"The tour was canceled by the company hours before. I asked if there were later tours available but was told no. Then received a call by the company at the time of sail asking if i was coming because they were waiting. No one else was there.
Later I received a message asking if i wanted the later time available.
Not good organization/communication.",2
Don't do this if you value your hearing,"Excruciatingly loud. My ears were ringing the next day. My friend had a mini panic attack and jumped off the boat just before we left the dock.

If you're going to get that loud, it would be good to start off quieter and let people get settled in, grab a drink, and adjust before you start in with the hearing damage. This was 0-100 before the boat left the dock.

The boat is too small for that many people. The ""snacks"" were an absolute joke. A disgusting bowl of chex mix that everyone had to dunk their hands into? No thanks.

This is a good idea if you:
- Don't like your friends and would rather not hear what they have to say
- Don't like being able to hear
- Like to dance on a moving boat (some do!)
- Just want to get drunk (no judgment)

The bartender was the best part of the experience. He was really nice and helpful, or maybe I just thought he was but couldn't actually hear him (or any of my friends) over the music.",2
Disappointing Experience – Would Not Recommend,"We were really looking forward to this boat tour, but unfortunately, the experience started off on the wrong foot. When we arrived, we weren’t allowed down the ramp even though it was an extremely hot 36°C day and my elderly grandmother was visibly struggling in the heat (we thought this tour specifically would be great for her because of the sitting down comfortably with snack and a cold beverage). When we eventually made our way down after the door was opened, the owner began shouting at us in a very rude and inappropriate manner. It was an incredibly unpleasant and unwelcoming start, and we were quite shaken by how he spoke to us.
Thankfully, the owner wasn’t the one conducting the actual tour. However, the experience itself was underwhelming. There was very little explanation or commentary during the trip, likely due to a language barrier, the man conducting the tour was a lovely gentleman.
The boat had barely any shade so be prepared to be uncomfortably hot and possibly sunburnt if you're going on a sunny day.
The listing on TripAdvisor mentioned snacks and drinks, but these were disappointing as well. The alcoholic drinks (beer and wine) were warm, and due to the heat, any ice provided melted almost immediately leaving no real way to cool down. The snacks consisted of dry biscuits coated in coconut flakes, and we expected more variety given the cost of the tour.
Overall, not a relaxing or enjoyable experience, and certainly not worth the money given the lack of professionalism, poor hospitality, and lack of basic comfort or quality.",2
We were at the meeting place to take the boat. someone came to tell us that the excursion will not have,"We were at the meeting place to take the boat. someone came to tell us that the excursion will not take place because too much wind;. We return to our hotel about 5km by taxi. Five minutes after arriving, we receive a call saying we were expected. We explain and say it was someone else. We explained that we were not going to take a taxi again?? He said he was gonna pay us back. To date we have not received anything. Are they dishonest??",1
Cancelled on the day,Cancelled on the day by text message just 2 hours before start time. Asked but No immediate refund and still waiting for contact.,1
DO NOT LEAVE FOR THE LAST DAY OF TRAVEL,"It didn't happen. The organization contacted us via TripAdvisor that for weather reasons would be cancelled... However, it did rain until 12:00, but made a sun for each after that time and there were other and other boats sailing. Google informed of rain conditions until midday, but that it would be sunny the rest of the time. Frustrating? Yes. We were going to celebrate our niece's birthday. Hurried cancellation? Talvez!
Stay the tip to everyone! Don't leave this tour for the last day. They say it's beautiful, but since it didn't happen, I can't give a better score.",1
Anesthetic wine?,"For the price charged, they have poor quality drinks and little choice.
We became sick after drinking the wine, the bottle of which was already open.
Personally, I was left with almost no motor and mental control after 3 glasses of wine, which is really strange.
It's never happened to me and I drink socially.
It was worth being with my mother who protected me and brought me home practically unconscious.
She herself, who only drank one glass of wine, is in bed.
I really don't know what happened, but no more wine from that boat.",2
STAY AWAY,"I think that this is the first time i write a review, but i had to, as this company just gave me the worst experience ever on a tour.
I booked the tour, everything seemed seamless, the confirmation came immediately and I was really excited.
Everything else was horrible !
Tried to contact the company to understand where I could be picked up, no one ever answered until the morning of the tour itself. The tour guide, I think his name was Miguel, screaming at me, I couldn't believe this was happening, and somehow still apologized to him, not really knowing what I did wrong.
Now I know that he couldn't drive in a historic neighborhood, I had no idea.
The tour continued and it was horrible, the guide was rude the whole day, with everyone not only me and my partner, so we only did the pena palace and took a train back, just like a Dutch couple that left before us.
I should have known there was something wrong, but the price was too appealing.
Stay away",1
Tour cancelled with little notice,"Wish I could rate this tour but they cancelled the evening before, leaving us with no other options to see the Belém tower and monastery. Very disappointing. 😔",1
Cunards DOWNWARD TREND in class and service,"Just finished our 7th Cruise with Cunard and this time with the Queen Anne. UTTERLEY DISSAPOINTED with the service we got from the pursers and the voyagers office. To start with this ship lacked the grandeur of the other Cunard ships. The floor plan was messed up badly with the following points to note.
1) The Queens room is much smaller than the other ships.They could not host the guests on any day in that room for afternoon Tea and had to move us to the Britanua club.
2) The library seemed liked an after thought on the 12th floor in one squishy corner which quite often had no staff member there.
3) the Gym was tucked away in the bottom of the ship near the Theater with no atmosphere at all.
4) As for the casino it was nowhere as spacious as the other ships. Guests were using it as a main throroughfare to move up and down the ship.
5) Deck3 which used to be the walking or relaxing deck with deck chairs on the other ships had just small benches as all the tender boats were on that deck on both sides.
6) The quality of the food in the Britania Restaurant has dropped considerably. Most of the meat dishes were like chewing leather.
I felt they were trying to push guests to the alternative restaurants where we had to pay to get a decent meal. Even the shows in the theater were sub standard on some nights. They were sort of pushing us to pay for caberet shows in anotehr venue on the ship.

Now about the VOYAGERS OFFICE:
The staff were unhelpful and did not seem happy with their jobs. They cancelled our shore excursions before the cruise and during the cruise with no explanation or alternative options. It was a couldnt care less attitude to their guests.
When going on shore excursions on tender boats to shore we all have to take a STEP TEST to see if we can cross into the tender. I was horrified to see an elderley man who could barely walk and had to be assisted on and off the tender by 3 guest staff. On one of the excursions, the sea was really choppy and the staff chose to get him off first which took a long time whilst other guests were almost sick with the tender listing a lot. I complained to the tender staff and asked them how he got through the step test as he was really putting 90 guests lives at risk both ways in an emergency. I then went immediately to the pursers office to compalin and asked the Supervisor to contact me in my cabin. NOTHING HAPPENED. The ships admin staff just dont care enough.

THE PURSERS OFFICE:
Tucked away in another back corner of the ship.
They constantly tell all the guests not to bring adaptors or extension cords. When you ask them on board for it. They either dont have it or make it look like its is all too hard and make you feel troublesome.

Cunard send their guests a terribly long tedious survey (which they probably know noone will take the time to complete) which I have filled twice and asked for someone to call or respond to my greviances. It has fallen on deaf dont care less ears!!

This time I thought I would put it out there to the general public and make everyone aware of the quick downward trend the Cunard cruises are taking of late.

Hope this helps many cruise goers!!

THE GIFT THAT KEPT ON GIVING.,"My daughter had her wedding on the beach and all the family members were staying at this property. There was a total of 8 rooms we rented out. Problem 1: The elevators did not work all the time and we were on the 6th floor my husband has a bad knee and it took some time for him to get up the stairs. #2: PARKING What a joke we were there over Memorial Day and people who were not staying there just came in and took peoples parking when my son went to talk to management they would not call the TOW TRUCK (like the signs says) and told them to find somewhere else to park!! #3 When we went to park there were Squatters in the parking area and having a barbeque so it made it hard for us to park.. #4 To get into the pool you didn't need a room key it was broken and who ever could go swim. # 5 If you eat in the Restaurant they will charge you 3 1/2 % to your bill if you use your card and added on quite the tip. #6 After I checked out I remember I had left my swimsuit in the dresser drawer, and I called them and the Lady at the front desk said she would look into this. My Son had stayed and he went down to talk with them also BUT WE GOT NO WHERE They never called me back she never wrote it down and my son was diligent in going in and talking to them!!! GOT NO WERE WITH THEM... # 7 OUR room was NOT READY until Way after check in!!!!",1
YUCK,Use this place twice a week. Tonight was just AWFUL. Inedible to be honest and we actually phoned to let them know. Won't be having anything from here anytime soon.,1
Unprofessional and unreliable,Used their service for transport from resort to airport. Paid 50 euro in cash but the driver couldn't provide a receipt but promised to email one to me. Receipt never arrived. I contacted them and again requested receipt. They promised to send that day but never followed through.,1
Arrogância,Arrogância no atendimento telefónico indisponibilidade para resolver a situação. Muito desagradável .,1
Bad experience,Terrible orchestra with very low quality musicians. Does not justify fame Musicians who enter and leave concerts like bored employees despite being part of the most solid cultural institution in Portugal,1
Don’t bother to go there,It’s just an abandoned buildings full of graffiti. This is definitely not things to do when you are in Lisbon. Don’t waste your time to see it.,1
Awful,"We ordered Bacardi and he said our selection was not good. He insulted me because it is my drink preference. No
I will be back! Your response is disrespectful, the customer has the right to what he drinks",1
Good beer but poor and unfriendly staff,"If you want to enjoy a very good beer this is very nice place to go, if you fancy a female bartender to treat you like an animal, disrespectfully and unfriendly, this is your place to go!",1
Bad.,"Arriving at Piazza Martim Moniz, crowded with men, some sitting others standing, urinating in the corners.
It was about 20:00 h very dangerous I do not recommend anyone to make this walk in the evening, mainly pick up in this square.
An awful place smelling urine.
The electric car is crowded, the majority of people walk, like sardine in a can, bad for tourists and locals.
Misleading propaganda of the people that spreads on the internet.",1
Shameful.,"From day to day they cut the route from Chiado to Campo de Ourique, making a route that in nothing serves the users who make daily this journey. It was no longer enough to be almost impossible to catch one who stopped, or who did not go with people scattered to the entrance door. Since the pandemic they cut and a lot in the number of electric vehicles in circulation and since then tourism has tripled since before that and never returned them again. An authentic attack not only on tourists but on people who work and need to catch daily. A shame!",1
Run away from it!! Naughty prank!!,"Not worth it!!! It was the worst experience I've ever had!! There is absolutely NOTHING romantic, as some people say,!! There was a queue of more than 1:30 hours (and it was cloudy, imagine sunny!!) to catch tram 28 at Praça Martim Moniz. Extremely rude employee, doesn't care if there are children or elderly people. Only 16 people sitting and a few standing. Before boarding, there are some trams lined up waiting for God only knows what, before thinking about picking up passengers. Not worth the time and patience!! Tram 28 is just another public transport in the city and you can take it anywhere on your route, there is no need to stand for hours waiting. With the lisboa card you have free access without having to pay. I had seen a tip that said to take the opposite route (Ourique to Martim Moniz), there was less queue, but honestly I don't think it's worth any effort to take the tour that lasts more than 1 hour. Here's a tip, then don't say I didn't warn you!! LOL",1
Rude staff,"Nice place, but the bartender is so rude I had to leave. Be carefully, the staff won't treat you right. It's disrespectful.",1
Pesimo,"Pesima la comida, cara y un show muy de circo pobre.
No volveria, carisimo y malo
El precio de cada plato era carisimo.
No volveria ni aunque me pagaran",1
Sardines Price Jacked!,Mindless and price jacked for idiots. A can of sardines for $20 and up. They make employees dress up as circus ringmasters while treating customers like monkeys.,1
Disappointment to the max,Much Circus and little quality in the sardines... dry... hard and bitter a whole set to sue that sale of sardines of such poor quality and so much price .Fatal,1
Avoid...Classic Tourist Trap,"All hype. Funny and unique for about 30 seconds...then you see that it's a big marketing game...crazily priced sardines....better to buy high quality sardines either in lots of retail stores or even at the airport for ¼ of the price. Actually felt for the people working there - the vibe was sort of ""yep, we know that you know""...best case, walk in, walk around for 30 seconds, walk out and do something memorable...",2
I ADVICE DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM,"Nice rip-off, classic tourist trap, wonderful shop to look at, the products sold have absolutely nothing exceptional, they can be found at half the price in any supermarket. Definitely excessive prices and not justifiable in the photo below... the ""gold"" version paid €22 in the description indicated in black and white that there would be gold leaf inside... non-existent. CIALTRONI! DO NOT GO THERE",1
Unpleasant Sales associate was rude and condescending Attitude,"My recent visit was overshadowed by an unfortunate encounter with a sales representative who exhibited an unpleasant and disrespectful attitude! This individual consistently interrupted our conversation and went on to make assumptions about our knowledge and language skills.

At one point, we were examining a product, and although it did mention ""chocolate"" on one side, we were not solely focused on that aspect. Instead of patiently listening to our perspective, the sales representative abruptly interrupted, stating, ""It literally says chocolate on the side!” This response was unnecessary and failed to understand that we were enjoying and appreciating the products in the store!

Moreover, when we attempted to explain our viewpoint, the sales representative dismissively stated, ""It's okay; you don't understand because you don't speak the language."" This response was not only condescending but also reinforced the stereotype of tourists as ignorant individuals.

As visitors, we appreciate being treated respectfully regardless of our level of familiarity with the language or product. It is disappointing that the sales representative did not uphold these basic principles of customer service.",1
Total tourist trap,"It's one of those terrible tourist traps which spoiled our holiday. Fancy looking shop deco and packaging. For what? To fool tourists into buying canned seafood at twenty euros each when you can get these in better shops usually three to five euros for better tasting ones. Enter only if you have money to throw into the ditch. I do not understand why others give high reviews, must be too kind.",1
Guide wasn’t up to the job bearing in mind the cost,Saw interesting places with an inexperienced guide. Nice enough guy though. He did his best but wasn’t very forthcoming with details about the places we visited,2
Rip off,Says open bar but have to line up for an hour and it’s 1 tiny drink per person not worth the price. Way too much money for the price.,1
Boring Boat Ride,"Went on a “dolphin watching” tour mid-afternoon. Started with boat not being ready at the scheduled time. Waited around in the sun for almost an hour. No dolphins (I understand they are wild animals and can’t be controlled), but at least make the boat tour interesting! One staff member going from row to row to point out sights and give a brief description. We found this very boring!!! Should have just taken the yellow boat so we could ride closer to shore and get off to explore.",2
More info,Instructions unclear could not find the group to board. No number to call as well. More information is necessary ………………………………………………………………..,1
to flee,"Total scam, we were well over 100 crammed on a boat, full to bursting, the boat moves very slowly so we stay close to the sides which decreases the chance of seeing dolphins that we will never see, 3 hours of deep boredom",1
No engagement / Boring,"We had high hopes for this tour but were given no information from our tour guides once on board. The boat was full to the brim to the point one of the guides demanded 10/15 people who had rushed upstairs on a chance dolphin sighting to go downstairs.

The ‘open bar’ is one choice of beer and Pepsi max from a 2L bottle. We caught a glimpse of some dolphins spotted by another tourist and not a crew member. No information given about monuments as we passed them and no information given about dolphins. Would not recommend this tour.",2
Wouldn’t do it again,"The cruise is packed with people, so you spend quite a lot of the time just standing in a line. Secondly there are two floors and they only allow a certain amount of people upstairs (where you cannot get a drink). Think the information and pictures are really misleading, but we had a good time",1
Weak,"We haven't seen dolphins.
There was a biologist on the boat, but she didn't share any information about dolphins.
There was no experience or entertainment on the boat.",2
"Easy to forget, not recommended","I do not recommend, it was very boring and wasting our time and money
Well, we didn't see any dolphins at all
I will never ever try anything like this in the future",1
AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!,"AVOID AVOID AVOID. Complete scam of a company. We booked our sunset cruise tickets for a 4:45 pm departure, arrived at 4:25 to a closed booth and no boats in sight. The booth opened at 4:50 and the representative told us that they don't give refunds or any exchanged compensation while smiling and laughing at the 5 of us. I've never been more disrespected. We ended up having to call the cops to resolve the continually escalating issue as she smiled and laughed at us",1
Help 🥵👎,"The boat does not look like a vulgar catamaran music shuttle on board 🤪no dolphins seen despite the commercial argument put forward to avoid for 35 euros per person you are entitled to a first price fruit juice or wine in a plastic bag to avoid in comparison from the competition which for half the price offers a much higher level I advise against, to flee without looking back",1
A fuir !,"Nous avions réservé 2 billets pour 90 mn sur un catamaran au coucher du soleil.
Accueil déplorable, l'équipier nous accueille sans un bonjour ni meme un sourire, il nous compte comme des bestiaux...
Ensuite, bien que le vent soit de nord ce soit là (8 mai) entre 12/15 noeuds, donc très simple de descendre et remonter le Tage à la voile, pas question de mettre les voiles, nous avons donc passé la soirée sur un cata à voile mais au moteur...
Et vous avez droit à un verre de vin blanc de mauvais gout
Visiblement les 2 équipiers n'avaient pas envie de nous faire passer une bonne soirée...

Fuyez !! ou pour faire cela allez sur un bateau à moteur, ca coute beaucoup moins cher",1
Bad experience overall,"I am very dissatisfied with the jewelcrafter's service. The service was simply rude, the lack of professionalism is glaring, and the judgmental attitude is unacceptable.
The mood and the experience overall was bad, and honestly, I wouldn't recommend. There are certainly better alternatives.",1
"Monumental, but Italian sculpture is far superior","This ""Monument to the discoveries"" (geographical), realized in its current version in 1960, intends to depict, albeit in a very schematic way, a caravel: the inclined lines that house the figures constitute the edges of the hull, while the sails are the three arches above.
The multiple characters represented on both sides are mostly Portuguese explorers of the golden age (1500/1600 AD).
The interior is hollow and would also be open to visitors, but not when we went there.
Not bad, because to me it did not convey any particular emotion.
Moreover, the sculptures are not stylistically pleasing nor shine for refinement: Michelangelo, Bernini and Canova are from another planet.",2
Save yourself 10 euros,This view only has to deal with the inside of the monument and the 10 euro entrance fee. The monument itself from the outside is gorgeous and can be viewed for free obviously there is absolutely no reason to spend 10 euros to take an elevator up to the top which is a very small viewing platform to see more of Lisbon. Five would have been fine save your 10 and eat a good lunch,2
Worth Visiting as Part of a Package With Other Nearby Attractions,"After visiting the Belem Tower, we headed east along the river to the Padrão dos Descobrimentos or Monument of the Discoveries.

The Monument was conceived in 1939 and opened in October 1960. The Monument is a 52 metre cement slab over a steel frame that commemorates the various Portuguese explorers during the Age of Discovery. The monument is shaped like the prow of a caravel, the most common type of ship used on these voyages from the 15th to 17th Centuries. There are 33 figures on the monument, 16 on each side with Henry the Navigator at the apex or prow of the “ship” overlooking the river.

The monument sits on a square of beige red and black limestone in the shape of a 50 metre in diameter compass rose. This was a gift from the South African Government. The monument is located just west of the Belem Marina and directly across from the Imperial Gardens that front the Jerónimos Monastery.

Aside from the monument itself there is not much to see here, however a visit could be combined with one to either the Belem Tower to the west and/or the Monastery to the north as an outing from Lisbon.

The Monument is often included as part of tours of Belem with these other attractions. Conversely one can take either public transit to the Monastery and cross the highway and railway lines on the bridge, or the commuter train from Cais do Sodré to Belem station.",2
"Outside wonderful, Inside not so much.","The Monument is incredible, the surroundings including the mosaic world map astounding. However... What should have been a museum about the monument, the artist, and explorers was an expensive lack of cohesive information. People come from all over the world to see the connection from Portugal to their home, to learn their history in place instead of from a textbook. Instead, the museum inside the monument had an exhibit, good I'm sure, but out of place and irrelevant to the monument. We had talked to our granddaughter about how she would be learning about these explorers in school someday. They aren't even identified. Poor judgement on the museum staff's part. This isn't a local museum that needs up to date changing exhibits. It needs to cater to all the tourist who come once to see and learn about the Discoverers.",2
Huge let down. History cancelled by new director,"We went to this place to learn about the amazing period in Portuguese history when its brave navigators encountered new lands. But now there is no mention of these heroes. None! The new Director of the monument has cancelled these heroes, he has written them out of the monument's narrative. Clearly he is ashamed of his nation and determined to focus on a fashionable leftist ideology. Boycott this degraded space.",2
On the way but nothing more,"People visit this monument because it is located on foot between the Belém Tower and the Jeronimos Monastery. It's good for 2 photos but don't come just for that, it wouldn't be worth it. Personal impression, you be the judge.",2
Augmentation du prix de +50%,"Augmentation de + de 50%.
Passé de EUR 6.- à EUR 10.- en 2023. Ils prennent vraiment les touristes pour des distributeurs d’argent. BOYCOTTONS !",1
Não perca dinheiro aqui,"Dê preferência à ao monumento por fora. É belíssimo. Por dentro, achamos caro (tendo em vista outros locais que cobram menos e oferecem 10x mais) e sinceramente: desnecessário. Você tem a mesma vista na Torre de Belém. Pagamos 10 euros cada, para uma vista e uma exposição que nada tinha a ver com o monumento. Saímos chateados e com a sensação de que fomos enganados.",2
Déçu de l'altitude,"Tout ce que vous devez voir. Se voit de l'extérieur. Payer 10€ pour monter sur un mirador et voir juste une vue. Cher pour prendre un ascenseur et quelques marches.
Pour 3€ j'ai préféré le mirador de l'arche de la place du commerce.",1
Worth walking to if you’re visiting area,We only viewed this from the outside as we'd already been in the Tower of Belem and we thought the views would be very similar. Very impressive structure.,2
"Rudeness, dishonesty and bad cocktails","Bad place, very rude owner. We were dragged to this place with a scam telling us that they would offer us a drink to inaugurate the new place. At the exit we were chased like thieves.... we would have done without entering even xche 'the drinks are bad! Don't let them fool you! We tried better places.",1
PAGO EN EFECTIVO,"Seguramente sea un buen sitio para escuchar jazz, pero el pago debe ser en efectivo. Como si estuvieramos en el siglo XIX. Y lo que es peor, no vimos ningún letrero que avise de esta modalidad. Inaceptable.",2
Disappointing,Great place. Unfortunately closed terraces for private event. Not warned we were very disappointed and we are content to visit the garden... for the 3rd time. Why don't you tell the public?,2
Definitely too expensive,"The price of 7 euros (no reductions for children) for visiting just the garden, whatever the age of the visitor, is really unjustified. Not only some parts of the small garden are unavailable, but the visitabile parts are largely under mantainance. No water in many fountains. The only real beautiful thing to see is the black swan in the little lake. I had to understand the situation from the fact that barely 10 people were inside, but I don't feel guilty for that... 3-4 euros would be the right price.",2
Beware not always open on Saturday - check first,We went on Saturday as that was advertised as the day it is open to visitors. BEWARE - if the president is in residence or there is something going on it is NOT always open on Saturday. It was very hard to see how to find out about entry. I tried talking to the guard but he gave me a hard stare! Nothing on the walls anywhere to tell you about visiting or where to go in. Anyway this is a review of a non-visit.,1
Depressing building and experience - what a neglected building and gardens …. Better places to visit and go,"It’s ok for a palace.

You see some three nice rooms but overall a rather disappointing and perplexing experience. Quite a few parts of the building complex are just run down and in severe state of neglect. The gardens are in a rather neglected and poor state for a palace that is inhabited by “somebody” - its just poor when you look more closely - all neglected. The office of the president is just depressingly dark, and stuffy with severely used sofas. It’s probably not even a question of money …. It’s just neglect and being careless. Seen a lot of presidential palaces in Europe and other countries and continents ….. and this is one I liked the least.

The Museum is small and ok, specially if like and know the local personalities.

Overall a rather disappointing and depressing experience - one can not even believe it’s the President that lives and works there.

Cidadela in Cascais is well worth the visit but Belém you should just depressingly bad.",2
Sinking Sun Experience,"They sent me a text, 40 min prior departure, informing me that the they cancelled the trip; without any explanation. I guess they didn’t have enough passengers thus decided to not sail out as the costs did not weight against the benefits. In the meanwhile, they wasted our precious vacation time as it was too late to book another SUNSET trip with a competitor.",1
Terrible customer service,"If I could give this a zero, I would. Never got the meeting time sent to me or additional instructions other than unclear directions on where to meet. Had an issue with a bolt driver causing us to miss the trip by 15 mins. Reached out to the tour guide who was unwilling to wait. Was really looking forward to this for our honeymoon.",1
Difficult entrance and experience,"This is the only museum we had difficulty getting inside. We had to rent a locker for 1 Euro to deposit a compact umbrella that was in my purse that measured 5 inches. After a walk across the courtyard to do this transaction, I come back and then I am told I can not go in because I have nail clippers and that is also not admissible. These are items that made it it through TSA and went in the Louvre, and I am asking where exactly am I going that is more secure that those places? At this point they let us through. The only displays we saw were all behind glass from floor to ceiling. We never saw the rooms of the palace. I am still not sure what we paid to see. Not a good experiance.",2
Disorganized and rude,"Disorganized and poorly educated. Although it appears on Google and TripAdvisor that all channels have opening hours of 10-17:30, we arrived at 12:30 and it was closed with a sign on the door. A super rude and rude attendant. Terrible",1
Das war dann wohl wiedermal nichts !!!!!!!!!¡!!!!,"Eigentlich wollten wir nur ein ruhiges Wochenende in Lissabon verbringen als wir in unserem Hostel beim frühstück von einem mädchen angesprochen und überredet wurden an einer Citytour teilzunehmen.
Als wir dann am nächsten Morgen am vereinbarten Treffpunkt waren passierte nichts, als wir dann nach einer halben Stunde versuchten jemanden telefonisch zu erreichen klappte das auch nicht.
Im Hostel sagte man uns das erst wieder am Montag jemand von Pancho Tours vorbeikommen würde wir ja aber am Montag schon wieder abreisen würden.
Das geld für die Tour, dass wir im vorraus entrichtet haben, haben wir nicht wiedergesehen und auf die Kontaktversuche unsererseits haben wir nie eine Antwort erhalten.
Darum kann ich nur vor Pancho Tours warnen und gebt den bloß kein Geld im vorraus den das seht ihr wahrscheinlich nie wieder.
PS: liebe grüsse an Daniel Castello branco, Graca Putagueiro und Iris Disruptiva ¡!!!!!¡!!!!!!",1
No Service given,"I didn't receive any contact in mail or whatsapp to organize the tour, I went to the place in the description but no one was in the place, basically, I didn't receive the tour, and requested a refund.",1
Unpleasant welcome,"It was terrible and I had barely gotten in yet. The door was open and we were considering whether we would pay and a lady working at the pantheon came and closed the door on us, still being rude to us. I find such behavior towards tourists unacceptable. Friendly advice (from those who are used to visiting) the doorman's job is to be pleasant and make us (tourists) want to come in to see, not the opposite. I am extremely sad that I have no desire to join the national pantheon. These attitudes must be corrected.",1
Beautiful but doesn't dance,"The structure is beautiful, what it also represents, beautiful panorama from the dome but €8 paid by purchasing the ticket directly at the ticket office seems exaggerated to me, if you consider that the pantheon in Rome was free until two months ago and it tells a lot of history after much more, it really seems like a theft to me.",1

Offensive to the customer,"Seems like a nice shop but products do not meet the prices qualitatively.
The staff are mainly older, sour and downright rude women.
Was not a good experience...",1
Medium,"Extremely unpleasant place, with no respect for the people around, dirty and expensive. Medium, cafeteria is not, for the smell of intragavel garbage",1
"Long wait, incomplete order","If you feel like waiting a very long time for your drinks, it is highly recommended!
Then you don't get your half order, you have to wait another half hour..
I'd skip this place",1
Bad service and really arrogant and rude girl,"We ordered three beers (already at the time of ordering it seemed that the waitress was doing us a favor), after 30 minutes only 2 beers arrive, we request the third, but it never arrived. So after 50 minutes of waiting WITHOUT HAVING CONSUMED we leave. Arrived at the elevator we were blocked by the waitress who started screaming at us losing that we paid for the 3 beers (never arrived)",1
Terrible,"Awful! Terrible bar, terrible staff. Don’t waste your time on the long walk down there. There are far better roof top bars.",1
Xenophobic security and terrible environment,"It blocked my entrance and my friends simply because we were Brazilians, they were super xenophobic! They ruined our night",1
Turns away homosexuals,"Went for a drink here as a group of ten. One of our group was refused entry as the bouncer said “no gays” this was a disgusting backwards way of thinking, especially for a city like Lisbon we thought was more forward thinking. Imagine picking on someone because of their sexuality.",1
Awful. Wouldn’t let Gay friend in.,"Horrible horrible place! We turned up as a group and they wouldn’t let our gay friend in due to his attire. Shocked to still see this in these modern times, especially in a city like Lisbon. Ruined birthday, please don’t support this place. #supportLGBTQ",1
Rude and disappointing: Vibe killer,"Visited as part of a hen weekend. Venue is made to look like a casual bar with pallet type furniture and actually has great views and good aesthetics. Got there for a mid afternoon drink and just felt like they didn’t want us there (we were not loud or disrespectful, this was the second drink after a long walk). The bride was told to remove her “bride to be “ head piece, the staff were rude, service ridiculously slow, unhelpful and when we asked where some of the drinks order was, we’re told we need to speak to the other waitress ourselves. One of the group was reprimanded for sitting with her feet up on the sill for the plants, and as a couple of the group took sandals off whilst we sat in the 24 degree sun with our drink also got told we needed to keep foot wear on. Honestly felt that we were inconveniencing their day at work! Toilets were utterly disgusting.",2
Super Overpriced,"The place is not as pretty as in the photos, the place is a informal bar with wood chair who serves typical drinks with a super expensive price. We ordered two London mules and we paid 38 euros, they didn’t serve any snacks to combine the cocktails and it was overpriced.
We didn’t like at all and we won’t be back for sure.",1
Went to check it out,"We been looking for this visit as photos are amazing, drinks looks ok. We had chips to snack on which are actually crisps cold and for 5 euro I mean sorry.
Music , not my cup of tea very rude songs on and on. This place has good potential but not this time.
Then asked for the bill, there was problem with system and nobody knows what’s going on.
Team need to be train much better and smile more as all look like they don’t won’t to be there at all!
We definitely won’t coming back.",2
"Worse service ever experienced, stay away from that place","We had the worse night ever in that bar.
Our time time started very badly as we were welcomed by a very aggressive waitress that yelled that us since the very beginning because we were taking to many chairs outside since we were a large group.
But that did not ended there, at the closing of the bar that same waitress was so agressive with us asking us to leave and always wanted to argue with everyone of us and talked to in an inacceptable tone. At the end she started an argument with us and yelled and insulted us as the other members of the staff like the bouncer were taking her side and yelled at us and pushed us to the exit very aggressively even though we were not done with our drinks.
We never experienced a level of service that bad even though we ordered a lot from them that night the way we were treated was unacceptable. Finally the worst part is that when we left the bar and were waiting in the street, the waitress threw a bucket of cold water on us from the rooftop.
Her behavior is not that of a waitress, her acts were so immature and we won’t accept being insulted like that. She should find an another job where she is not in contact of the public since she spoiled our whole night that was for our friend’s birthday.
Save your money for other rooftops in Lisbon we’re the staff is more respectful, it’s not worth it to come her and get insulted, stay away from that place at all cost.",1
Bad,"AVOID !!! This bar was the worst night of my life. The waitresses were rude and liars, to a point I have never seen. The bouncer was violent. I denounce this bar: violence, insults and discrimination. The memmo rooftop is much nicer.",1
They charged a high price,"The price of the drinks was a steal! They charged me €15 for two draft Somersby ciders and a small flavorless rock water, and when the employee asked me if I wanted a receipt I said yes, and on top of that he only gave me the ATM receipt. Furthermore, I was the one who had to order drinks at the counter. I went to look at photos of the menu on the internet and after all the prices didn't match!!",1
Absolter Agrosecurity refuses entry without reason,"An extremely aggressive security guard turned us away as a friendly, good-looking group - for absolutely no reason.
The bar should hire staff who are interested in customers and not stress. Be careful.",1
Very rude and unhelpful staff,"Very disappointed! We had read in our guide book to try this place and we had high expectations.
Once we arrived staff were rude and service was extremely slow! we got our over priced drinks after a 30 minute wait and my aperol spritz was flat and my friends drink was very weak.

Cushions were disgusting and need replacing.
Such a shame as beautiful views from there but the staff and quality of drinks and furniture let it down. I definitely wouldn’t recommend.",2
"Lack of interest, discrimination and lack of education among employees","We waited a long time, and we asked three employees to place our order and were completely ignored. We noticed that whenever they are Portuguese they don't pay attention to their customers. When we were finally served, we showed our displeasure and before being served, the employee who served us first said to the other employee ""be careful, this one bites"", in a total lack of respect, I won't be returning and I won't recommend it.",1
Terrible experience,"Don’t go here. Extremely unfriendly staff. Not worth for the price, plenty of other bars that are much better. Wasn’t even allowed to play cards there when we sat all alone in a corner. Not even allowed to rotate chairs to watch the sun…",1
Betere rooftops te vinden in Lissabon,"Mooi zicht eens je de akelige lift of 6 verdiepen met de trap hebt getrotseerd. ""Cocktails"" zonder proefbare alcohol (of geen?) en een rietje is er gewoon niet, zelfs niet als je er achter vraagt. De mooie plaatsen zijn schaars dus volgens mij niet de moeite noch het geld waard.",1
Bad service and overpriced!,"Not recommended! Very poor service, waiters are just rude and demanding for some reason. Prices are high and the quality of furniture is low, it seems that this rooftop has existed for a couple of years and nobody has washed the pillows and seats. Although there is a beautiful view, I would suggest finding something else.",1
Je mettrais moins d’une étoile si je pouvais,"Très déçue, mes amis et moi nous y sommes rendus à 7 en étant très excité mais c’était pas du tout ça. Déjà l’endroit est pas très grand, les tables des gens d’avant ne sont pas débarrassés, le service est très lent et si on veut commander directement au bar on se fait refouler et on nous dit d’attendre à la table. Les verres sont chers pour être si peu dosés, la sangria est une sorte de salade de fruit gazeuse. Et lorsqu’on a la chance de se faire servir mais que le verre de cocktail a 12€ est renversé sous les yeux du serveur à cause d’une table instable on refuse de vous refaire le faire (ou de vous donner quoique que ça soit d’autre en échange). Jamais vu un endroit si peu commercial.
Il y a même pas particulièrement d’ambiance. Il y a pas grand chose à gagner à aller à ce rooftop, Lisbonne est rempli de meilleurs points de vues et meilleurs bars.",1
aller voir ailleurs,"Jolie rooftop donnant vu sur Lisbonne, mais très déçu. Plus d’une heure d’attente pour deux malheureux cocktails qui n’avaient pas de bulles. Terrasses pleine pour seulement un serveur. Quand j’ai décider de me lever pour aller commander au bar moi même, le serveur qui avait prit ma commande m’a dit « le service se fait à table ».
Très déçu je recommande pas.",1
Surcoté,"Pas de places assises le personnel pas sociable, super sélectif pour au final ne pas voir la vue, chère pour le service médiocre !",1

Contemporary Lisbon,"I insisted on visiting this very modern part of Lisbon, coinciding with the area that had hosted Expo 1998, intrigued above all by the cable car on the Tagus, but almost immediately regretted it. This infrastructure, unlike what I had imagined, runs along the right bank of the river rather than across it and has no use other than to offer an elevated vantage point.
I felt almost mortified to have induced my friends to follow me on this morning that turned out to be a waste.
For the rest, the district is characterized by modern architecture, among which the shopping center and a large indoor oval-shaped arena stand out, as well as some gigantic contemporary sculptures.",2
Not indispensable,"Not much to see around here around noon. This is very quiet. Quite pleasant walk along the water but aging park. Not very well maintained.
The only interest is to come and visit the oceanorium. Or the shopping center which is nice (with a food court).
It was certainly good in 98 for the Universal Exhibition but now it is no longer of much interest.",2
Include on your list of things to do if you have a special interest in gardens,"This is a very nice garden with a fountain so if you have time on your hands, then I would recommend going. Otherwise, I really didn't see the need for a special stop here.",2
LACK OF MAINTENANCE,"Another park without maintenance, unmowed lawn, hedges that overflow the driveways and especially a lot of waste.
The view of the river the city and the statue of the Marquis de Pombal is spoiled by temporary structures not dismantled.
So not great.",2
Simpel park,"The park is beautiful, however had a fairground placed so the view was not beautiful. It is a well-kept park.",2
A park,Fine as parks go. Why have an exceptionally large greenhouse that is not open to the public. Looks like a good playground if you have children. Clean and well maintained.,2
100% for tourists...at a tourist price,"Absolutely overrated. Focused 100% on tourists. Correct service, very normal quality of food, small and uncomfortable place, and between the first and the second there is about 1 hour of waiting time because they sing fados between the 2 dishes....when the second arrives (fish not very tasty) you have been digesting for a while....all this at about 75 euros per person",1
A bridge more useful than attractive,"This bridge in Belem crosses Avenida de Brasilia, the railway and Avenida de India. It is a more useful than attractive structure. An underground passage a few hundred meters away also does the trick.",2
Concrete,There is too much concrete. Natural beauty of meandering riverfront is sadly lost forever in this area.,1
Catastrophic,"What a failed experiment!!
We do not understand the rating and comments read.
1 cocktail really not great and another one too strong in vodka, nothing refined or nice...
Really ugly presentation (see photo) worthy of a cocktail in a cheesy bar or a low-cost establishment.
Anyway, we came a long way on purpose, big disappointment, especially for the price",1
Bad treatment,"That's bad! The owner is a very rude and I just call it that because otherwise they won’t let me publish the review: we kindly asked for a table for 6 they gave one for 5 we ask for another chair and my friend is pushed away and the owner pushes her putting his hands on her breasts, waiters worse still laughing like idiots. What a great shame",1
Care of poor quality,"Poor entertainment staff. They treated clients badly, without any kind of sympathy, giving signs of homophobia.",1
Horrible staff,"Very rude and poorly educated
Service 0
We're not back there anymore
We were also abused by the boss. They can't serve the customer
I do not recommend",1
"Dive bar quality cocktails, not worth the money","Came in with high expectations after reading other reviews. Ordered an old fashioned. First I was in a glass overflowing with ice, then they used rock guy Jim Beam to make it, then they throw in orange slices and a cheap cherry. This is what I would expect from a cheap dive bar that is known for beer. To say the least disappointing. On a good note, it is a really cool place.",2
Be warned this is a waste of time ! Don’t ruin your night!,After the excitement of ringing the bell we entered a hauntingly dead quiet place with no atmosphere and no smiles. A place lacking any sort of fun. All the staff were miserable which took away from the experience and made us feel unwelcome. The playlist (though it played tunes like MIB by will smith) did not fit the place at all. Though it is highly recommended I would warn everyone away from this place as it leaves you with an eery and uncomfortable experience that dampens the night.,1
Antipathic,"Waiters very dry and very unfriendly, I have known the place for about 25 years and it has absolutely nothing to do with what it was. Imposition of table, unfriendly, and obligation to consume any person of the group without exception. I will not take visitors there again, nor recommend, sorry for what was and is no longer.",2
Mediocre,"Portugal at its worst. One pretends. I don't even comment, I prefer to go outside. Instead of not having any fun going out to Lisbon on the weekends, I go to certain countries where partying is guaranteed even if it's just for a month.",1
A huge HUMILIATION and DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"I've known this bar for over 30 years! Since I was a teenager, in the 90s, I really liked going here with friends or as a couple...
Yesterday, May 2nd, the way I was treated was AN ABSOLUTE SHAME!!! A totally humiliating, disrespectful and disregarded situation. It should be noted that for the employees or those responsible for this bar, what matters to them is their comfort and convenience, but never the customer's convenience. They are not at all empathetic, they don't listen to the customer, in fact the way they act shows that the customers, in fact, that we are the ones we pay (and not cheaply) do not matter to them at all.
Yesterday my friend and I wanted to stay at one of the more than 10 available tables, which we were never allowed to sit at with the excuse that they were reserved. They wanted to put us in corners where it felt like we were grounded, where we couldn't even appreciate the beauty of the bar, which is precisely what invites us to enter. Or, alternatively, they guided us to tiny tables next to groups of people where we couldn't even be intimate enough to talk. In other words, tremendous disrespect and humiliation. And to top it all off, they put us in the last room where 10 English people were playing just like an Irish bar, shouting emails as we couldn't even hear each other talking. Faced with all this, the response of the inconsiderate employees was the cold: these are house rules... Wow! House rules???!!! Placing ""punishment"" customers on a micro table at the entrance to the door or next to people without allowing a private moment to talk or in the last room transformed at that moment into an Irish tavern, is this the norm of the house???!!! Very good! We must applaud your business model where the customer is the least important. The most ironic thing of all is that after having a drink and leaving, the so-called or supposed reserved tables were still empty and managed to ruin what could have been a beautiful evening for 2 customers, one of whom was actually a former regular customer. Conclusion: If you don't want to have a disappointing night DON'T GO to Pavilhao Chines, or go in to see the decoration and leave without consuming anything, as it will be a cheaper and more pleasant night, without humiliation. DISAPPOINTING!!!",1
terrible,"I give it 1 star because I can't give it 0. bad service, cocktails with unclear ingredients. not worth the price you pay",1
Terrible welcome,"I went yesterday, December 23rd, at the end of the afternoon. We were four people. The room had two occupied tables, one a group of five people, the other a couple.
They wanted us to sit at the same table next to the group of five people. We refused because it was a table located in a less comfortable place and because we were so close to other people.
We chose a table, but were told that we couldn't stay there as it was a table for five people.
If the room was almost full or if it was a busy time, it was understood. But none of that happened. We didn't stay and we won't go there again.",1
I didn't get it,"Not for me this one. Perhaps it's because we were there early evening, but the atmosphere was a bit odd, the music was cheesy (for me, terrible). The cocktails were average. The quirky decor looks quite cool but that's about it. With so many nice places to take in Lisbons scenery I wouldnt recommend sitting in a dark, musty bar. One thing I would say is that the service was fine and the staff friendly, given some other reviews perhaps it's just a bit patchy.",2
"Over-hyped, poor service and communication","Cool visual identity but over-hyped and overpriced (like everything else in that area), with a poor service and communication.
I've been to Pavilhao Chines tonight, for the first and last time. I wanted to order a simple cheese sandwich, with 4 cheese options available. I briefly talked over those options with the waiter and he suggested me to have an open sandwich with 3 varieties of cheese displayed in the plate so that I could try them all out and serve myself with the bread slices. Suggestion accepted.
Then to my surprise, when I got the bill, I was charged 3x the price of the original sandwich I meant to order. What the waiter suggested was actually a different type of dish, with a different price and size, and he was not clear about it. He didn't call the dish by its name nor brought that detail to my attention.
I explained the situation to the manager but he washed his hands of it. The waiter insisted that he correctly described to me what I was gonna be served with, I insisted the price and dish category difference was unclear, and no one came up with a solution or at least an attempt of a service recovery. I ended up paying the triple-priced bill.
I value my money and the transparency of the services I use. The miscommunication might have been unintentional (still questionable since the waiter and I share the same mother tongue and nationality) but its management was poor and reckless. All I got was disregard.
I'm not coming back and I don't recommend this service. There are plenty of better places to explore in the city.",1
Rude service,Rude and very authoritarian service. They don't let you choose where to sit as there are many free tables.,1
A wasted opportunity,"A friend recommended me this place. I found it to be a nice place ruined by bad lighting, typically insipid Portuguese service, and cheesy music",2
Desilusão,"Não ia ao Pavilhão há uns 20 anos....desilusão....independentemente do sítio em si que é tão carismático e o torna único com as diferentes salas, decoradas com vários objetos, mas chegar, passado uns minutos já dentro do bar, perguntam o nr de pessoas, no caso 4, empregado pede para ser acompanhado, e volta costas, larga o grupo e começa a anotar os pedidos de uma mesa. Ficámos especados à aguardar e ninguém a orientar. Foi preciso chamar outro empregado sem grandes sorrisos, e dizer que estávamos a aguardar mesa. Enfim....sem falar no tempo de espera para pedir. Para sermos servidos. E para pagar! Tivemos que nos levantar e dirigirmo nos à caixa. Experiência desagradável e desilusão para quem conheceu o Pavilhão Chinês de outros tempos e fazia questão em levar amigos de fora a experienciar um bar diferente! Não voltarei! Lisboa tem mais bares, únicos e também com história....é verdade!",1
Pretentious and overhyped,We were about as welcome as a hot dog turd. Tables reserved for ghosts that never appeared. Real bad,1

Dismal service,"Lamentable! The promise of an atypical place with a kitch deco between the brothel and the cabaret, unfortunately the service is deplorable, we were sitting in the middle of the passage, at least 4 different waiters passed in front of us snubbing, service at the head of the customer? Know what! In any case two customers came in asking for 2 seats and the waiter did not have a word of apology when we had given up our seats in front of him without having been served after 15 minutes of waiting while other tables had been served around us. A lack of customer respect and a lack of professionalism, to be avoided absolutely!",1
Bad service,"No longer lend. And increasingly badly visited. Now even gangs come in.
No longer worth your while. Poor costumer service. Even gangs now get in",2
"Don't bother, much nicer places to visit","Unfortunately this failed to deliver.
The cocktails were not nice and we left ours.
We sat outside and then were told to move because the outside closes at 10pm.
Very underwhelming, and would not bother again",2
.,"When you make a criticism do not let it publish why? Being great isn't just beautiful comments. But adults have nothing after the sadness they have done to people who have always visited your space in a cordial and respectful way.

Noisy creepy cliché.,"Hotel located in a night owl street (bar, nightclub at the foot of the hotel) itself having a very noisy bar on the first stage
Lovers of calm refrain.
Furthermore, the quietest room offered overlooks a low wall and is ultra dark, even a little gloomy. Nothing fancy...
Otherwise view of the street and its noise for a larger room.
We fled without even sleeping in the hotel, paying two nights for nothing.
In search of romance and charm, flee this hotel. For us, this was a mistake.",1
I think trash-ao,"I think rubbish. Every other day the electricity or air conditioning (which they control and not you) didn't work. The mess on the street below which is the kingdom of piss and vomit is constant. Exorbitant cost for such a dirty facility. A white stain on the sofa was waiting for us in the room as soon as we arrived. The (otherwise fake) invention of the dating house only seems to relieve the responsibility of daily cleaning. The staff is kind but does little to resolve the more serious problems, which are of general management of the structure. The common areas are really dirty and checking in at 5pm basically steals half your day.",1
Un peligro!!!!,Un desastreeeeeee!!! Los patovicas de la entrada le pegaron una trompada a mi amigo y le rompieron la mandíbula en 3! Este lugar debería cerrar urgente!!!!,1
Racismo e xenofobia,"Seguranças que liberam a entrada extremamente orientados a serem xenofóbicos e racistas.
Na minha primeira experiência, meu amigo estado unidense e um britânico (super bêbado), foram liberados numa boa, enquanto que o meu único amigo brasileiro e alterado pelo alcohol da mesma forma que os demais foi o único que sofreu comentários de que não deveria entrar (debatemos até que fosse liberado).
Se a primeira experiência restou alguma dúvida, essa de hoje foi o estopim. Fui acompanhada de mais 3 amigos brasileiros e um deles (o único negro), foi acusado de estar vestindo calças inadequadas (calça esportiva da Nike, a mesma que outro amigo branco também estava e não foi acusado de estar vestido fora dos padrões exigidos). No mesmo instante apontei para outros europeus que foram liberados com calças de elástico na barra ainda mais curtas, questionando a decisão do segurança que me respondeu apenas ""vocês não irão entrar"".
A minha resposta de indignação foi e permanecerá para todo e qualquer estabelecimento racista e xenofóbico como este, que ""não pisarei mais os meus pés""!",1

Waste of time.,"Checked the opening times on their website, turned up 1 hour after opening only to be told there were no English speaking tours until 3.00pm, a 4 hour wait..... apparently not worth entering if you don't speak Portuguese and don't or can't wait. Pity they failed to mention this before we travelled all the way out from the city centre,wasting lots of valuable time which could have been spent elsewhere.",1
Disappointed,"We went in family with great enthusiasm to attend a planetarium session.

The explanations a little monotonous",1
Weak,"The planetarium is in need of renovation and the price/performance ratio is pretty poor. The staff only play with their cell phones.

Bad experience at Plateu,"I was inside Plateu nightclub dancing with my friends when a security guard came to pick me up from the dance floor and asked me to accompany him to the door. I didn't understand why. Apparently, another security guard mistook me for a girl who had been there the previous week (when I wasn't even in the country) and had started some trouble. After explaining to the security guard that it wasn't me and that I didn't know what he was talking about, he continued to be suspicious of me and said “hmmmm, if it wasn't you, it was a very similar girl”. I decided to write in the complaints book about this incident and then not only could no one tell me the security guard's surname (I only know that his name was Carlos) but also the manager of the room (who only identified himself as “Joca”) spoke to me in an intimidating manner saying that if I made a complaint I would never be allowed to enter the club again. I don't think this is how you treat customers. it's sad, I don't intend to go back to this club and I recommend all people to avoid it.",1
Elevator closed!!!,"Lisbon card 24 hours:

Disappointing visitor experience,The bridge is magnificent but the bridge experience/visitor centre was disappointing. The elevator was not working. We could have climbed the 300+ steps to the viewpoint but decided not to. Information on the bridge construction is detailed on iron plates outside. Very difficult to read and it was windy & raining when we visited. Not much to see inside. There's one room in the centre of which under a glass table top is a model of the bridge.

Wine NOT? Not worth it.,"The best parts of the tour were going to a place that made the handmade and painted tiles from Portugal and the market where they sell fresh fish, meats and cheeses.
We were expecting tours of large wineries that made port, verses the small ones from the Douro valley. They did not have the pastries they were supposed to have. There was lunch in a very small town that didn’t have anything to really look at if you didn’t want to eat.

DO NOT BOOK,DO NOT BOOK. Tour operator is a dodgy setup. Meeting point is not where the ticket explains and we missed our time slot as a result. Operator then gave us a ‘dodgy’ ticket. Do not book.,1
We didn't go!,"After booking on Viator(owned by TripAdvisor) we received information about the tickets that we had to pick them up in a cafe which sounded very odd. Did some research and there are a few reviews saying this was a scam so I contacted Viator who said it wasn't a scam, it's just where the local company they use choose. So why wasn't there a time on the information to meet Mallick then? Why were there reviews saying no-one at the cafe knew anything about this? And why, most importantly did Mallick not reply when I messaged on WhatsApp? I've complained to Viator who are investigating. On the morning we were to go we received a call from Lisbon tour company saying it was cancelled as there was a fire incident at the location(no-one hurt). I was told to contact Viator to get our money back but then got an email saying they would refund it. Why aren't Viator paying attention when in these days of scams the customer is saying they don't feel comfortable with a ""pick tickets up from a cafe"" arrangement? Especially when Mallick (the name I was given on the info) didn't respond and made the whole thing stressful? Please just book tickets direct from the venue. Hopefully we'll get our money back but not at all impressed with this this whole situation.",2

Unable to get a response from the tour provider..
Had to purchase another ticket and wait in line for an hour.
Please do not waste your money.",1
"Terrible experience, disorganized and guide mistake","Do not recommend. The voucher provided is not a ticket. You have to meet a guide beforehand, it’s very confusing.

Never again,"So call skip the line ticket is a scam. You still waiting the line. You still wait during the visit and because it’s true or group you can’t move really from one room to another

It’s probably beautiful. I suggest going early morning and with a tour so they get you there for sure.",1
The park was great but the booking was a scam,This booking is not an actual ticket. They make you pick it up in town. They also charge 80% more than the actual ticket.

SCAM BEWARE - DO NOT BUY,"SCAM!!! Do not go, just book directly through the Quinta da Regaleira website. You can’t actually get in prior to 10 anyways. We booked this and were told to meet at a croissant shop to get our tickets. We arrived at 9am and no one was there, no one showed up to give us our tickets. We had no other option than to buy tickets directly from the castles website and luckily they weren’t sold out. There is no benefit from actually buying this experience. We requested a refund and they wouldn’t give it to us clearly because they just scam people.",1
Sad but nice,"we got ripped off for tickets from a guy so called operating our of a bakery/coffee shop, skip the line at 33 euros for each of the 4of us ,never got the tickets or could cancel ,.So we refought the tickets at the gate and they were really only 12 euros each, and no such thing as a skip the line.While inside we really did enjoy this palace and gardens, plus the cave tunnels.",2
A disaster,"Not only do they charge more than 10 euros than the tickets, but you also HAVE to go and exchange them at a croissant place! It's ridiculous!

This company sells you an experience, then change the date and time so often that you miss your tour and they keep all your money.
I complained to the tour operator and they say NO REFUNDS.
I alerted the Portuguese authorities of the SCAM but they offered no help.
I am putting together a class action law suit against these fraudsters. Post your story and add your name to the law suit (classactionsuitfarmexperience@gmail.com)",1
Heartless,"A heartless business. We had pre booked and prepaid a tour, including the lunch option. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we were unable to attend the farm at the appointed time. Our rental car broke down and it took over five hours to get a replacement vehicle and get back on the road. We explained this to the operator. We were prepared to just do the farm visit, without the lunch option, latter that day or the next day. They flatly refused any alternative arrangements. Nor, did they even consider a refund. We were really looking forward to learning the cork business at a cost of $350.00 Canadian per couple. Very disappointed that this heartless operation would not want to assist us…customer service was terrible. Their attitude was , simply, tough luck!! Just greedy!!",1
Very disappointing company experience,"Poor customer service
We booked a tour with this company and due to our rental car having mechanical issues we’re unable to make the tour. I called and explained the situation early in the morning prior to the tour to the customer service rep. I asked if we could cancel and if we could attend the next day. They were unable to accommodate another tour they said due to being full and also refused to offer a refund. They said I agreed to their cancellation policy which only spoke of cancellation due to not wanting to attend or illness. Considering we could not attend due to our extenuating circumstances they would offer no refund. I would never book with this company. We are out of pocket $700 and after numerous requests to be given another tour or refund due to a situation not in our error they stoped responding to emails and offered nothing for compensation.",1
Cork Farm Experience felt unsafe,The tour was called Cork Farm Experience for €59 per adult. My wife and I with our young child arrived at the permanently closed lot (according to Google) to find no one there except a 4 door pickup truck. This was the emailed meeting point. We traveled there via very narrow back roads and seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. I tried calling the contact number provided on the email several times without answer. Around 10 minutes after the scheduled tour start time a man walked out of the building and asked if we were there for a tour. Keeping in mind we were in the middle of nowhere at a permanently closed lot I asked the man what the name of the tour was. He didn't know but instructed us to get into his truck. I told him I didn't feel safe with that arrangement with my family. He said he was a farmer and someone convinced him to charge to give tours of his farm also stating that we could not follow him in our own car. My family and I left this tour situation because of feeling unsafe. Something to add is my wife and I have been on many tours in many different countries and never cancelled before because of feeling unsafe. This includes hiking up Mount Sinai starting at 2am for a sunrise tour with just my wife and the tour guide on a self arranged sightseeing trip throughout Egypt. The difference was there were other tourists in sight and the guide was knowledgeable about his tour.,1
False advertising,Would leave negative stars if I could. We purchased an experience that the winery did not even provide and the farm experience company refused to reimburse us for the full amount. The winery was embarrassed by these tour companies and how the continue to scam people. The winery tasting itself was amazing and we highly recommend going to pico wines but make sure you book with them directly!,1
They don't show up at meeting point,"We booked a daily trip and they did not show up at the meeting point. They did not even answer the phone at the number provided with the reservation for more than half an hour, and when they did they were only able to say they didn't see it. I read from previous reviews this already happened with other customers in the past, which makes it even worse. Highly unprofessional.",1
Guide was not very good.,Our guide was not very good. He seemed preoccupied with something else the entire time. Not that knowledgeable about Fátima.,2
Lacking in Professionalism,"My experience with Colleen from Portugal the Place was far from professional. From the start, she was often disagreeable and unresponsive. We had concerns early on about her ability to work with a couple like us—early retirees from a diverse background. Despite expressing these concerns upfront, particularly regarding her limited experience with individuals from different ethnicities and life experiences, Colleen assured us that she could meet our needs.

Unfortunately, over the course of two months, there was little communication or progress. When we asked for updates, her responses were vague and centered around “the process,” without any tangible results. This was especially disappointing as we had a pending visit and no clarity on where we stood. Her unprofessional responses to our questions made the situation even more frustrating.

After switching companies, we immediately saw a difference. Within 24 hours, we had two house viewings booked, and the new company provided clear, prompt updates. They were not only more responsive but also more affordable—half the price of Colleen’s fees. They even assisted with our visa process, going above and beyond in a way that Colleen did not.

It seems Colleen may be more focused on tours than meeting client needs, possibly due to being overburdened. For anyone who has experience living in multiple countries or states, I would not recommend working with her. She does not seem to have the skill set or the professional responsiveness to support those with more complex needs.",2
Plus jamais,"Première fois, le chauffeur a râlé au téléphone avec son collègue que le trajet ne valait pas le coup, qui faisait que gaspiller l’essence. Il parlait en brésilien et croyais que je ne comprenais rien.

Deuxième fois
Malheureusement Taxi jamais venu, mais cours déjà en avance.

Remboursement pas possible.
Plus jamais je réserve si c’est Top Tour",1
Shameful,"I was a teacher in this school in September 2022 and I have proof of everything I mention here. Teachers here are paid under 10€/h without any legal assurance.
They were completely non-transparent about the real hourly fee earned, avoiding to talk about that.

When I had to leave the school because I had a better offer, they were completely resentful and never paid me for the week of lessons that I worked for.
I have proof of the emails from their lawyer refusing to pay me for the amount that I worked for.

If you are ethically concerned about the working conditions in Portugal, think twice.",1
AVOID: Classes cancelled without notice due to teachers (without contracts) leaving AND refund refused.,"I was a student at Portuguese Connection from June to October 2022. The school was superb during the summer, that is from level A1 to A2. Unfortunately they struggle to fill classes at level B1 and on two occasions they cancelled classes at the last minute. On one occasion I had flown in for two weeks especially to study. On the second occasion I told them that it was not good enough and asked for a full refund.

The school has recently lost a number of teachers; they seemingly work without contracts, so can give notice on a Friday and the next week’s classes are cancelled and the school seems to believe that students should just tolerate it, worse they fell back on grossly unfair T&Cs which permit them top cancel classes without notice.

Despite repeated appeals they have refused any refund. So I would suggest that you avoid this school if you want to be certain (1) to receive classes you have booked and paid for AND (2) receive a refund if you can’t adjust your schedule to theirs. It’s a real shame because the teachers are brilliant. Other schools in Lisbon, do offer guarantees, I suggest you shop around.

To cancel classes and refuse a refund (over €600) amounts to fraud. Avoid.",1
Pena Palace - Not worth the long lines and overcrowding.,Pena Palace is a miserable experience. Whoever manages this place sells tickets for about 4 times the number of people who can fit comfortably and enjoy the visit. You are herded into a crushing line that feels like a death march. There is no opportunity to stop and look at things in detail. There is also very little information about the history of the palace and the people who lived there. What a missed opportunity.,2
"Unreliable, cancelled without notice",Not reliable. Researched and booked this company months in advance based on reviews. Confirmation tour paid for received 2 days prior in July then next day received email just advising booking cancelled without notice and refunded without a reasonable explanation or assistance in other options. Noted vehicle issues. Due to late notice and only having 1 day left in Lisbon that we could visit Sintra with trains striking left as not many options and scrambling to visit. The company held our contact details a more personal approach and explanation as to why cancelled without notice and advice on other options given this was pre booked months in advance would have been appreciated. If vehicle issues isn’t there a contingency plan with a back up vehicle.,1
Tourist Office,"Could not reach the tourist station 3 days without answer. No info on the site.
No other place found in Lisbon",2
Be careful of the taxi,"Be careful of the taxi recommended by the tourist office. My mother-in-law and her cousins visited Lisbon with a taxi driver and he took them to several places.
During one of these visits, he suggested not bothering with the handbags and they went for a walk, leaving the bags and the driver in the car.
On their return, they found that €900.00 had been stolen.
The driver denied the facts and they went to file a complaint with the police and complain to the tourist office.
Great ride and rent a car instead it will be less risky.",1
Pick-pocket,"Very nice place. Many tourists, I expected, probably naively.
I had to say goodbye to my wallet that left with a pickup pocket in a nearby street, with papers, credit card and cash.

This ruined the end of my trip, knowing that the registration of the complaint with the police station is only formal, no research, no stopping of this activity surely very lucrative.",2
Flavorless food,"Good location, nice view, but tasteless pizza and salad for an Italian restaurant. Service more than one industrial company",1
Attractive but blighted by the drug dealers harassing you constantly,"Remove the fake drug dealers and it would be lovely, all the way down rua Augusta (even in Avenida de Liberdade) and into the square you are constantly accosted by guys pushing cocaine, weed , hash offering to let you try the product.. mostly they will take the hint if you say no firmly but the odd one keeps pushing and you have to become a bit more aggressive to get rid of them. Sadly a complete blight on an otherwise lovely city with great people and because these dealers mostly only actually sell fake drugs like crushed paracetamol, crushed bay leaves etc the police cannot arrest and charge them with anything. It could be fixed if there was a will to do so , but I guess tourism in Lisbon is not valued very much. I imagine for some this would be a terrifying experience.... Just consider this carefully and be prepared if you decide to visit. Research it for yourself, quick search on Google..",1
Rien d'exceptionnel,Lors de notre visite de Lisbonne nous avons également visité ce quartier. La praça do principe Real ne montre rien d'exceptionnel. Si vous ne résidez pas dans ce quartier mon avis est que c'est une perte de temps que de s'y rendre.,2
Další z mnoha náměstí kde nabízej fet,"Tohle náměstí vypadá už jako bych se pohyboval v nějaké pofiderní části města. Navíc mi tu nabízeli za bílého dne drogy, přímo mezi lidma, hnus. Jedna, dvě fotky a rychle pryč. Bohužel, tohle se mi nestalo v Lisabonu výjimečně.",2
Pity about the Pickpockets,This plaza had wonderful interesting food and gift stalls dotted around the perimeter when we visited in late June '24 but we chose to eat at a curb side restaurant on the station side of the square. Food was unremarkable but the pickpocket that relieved me of my credit cards will remain in my memory of Lisbon forever.,2
Do not use this parking station,We booked online and made a typo with the number plate. I went to the office to ask them to assist. He said bad luck pay twice,1
Poor stay on site,"The park itself is excellent, very well located, very well signposted, has great parking spaces, however they play music at high volume throughout the night, which makes staying there almost unbearable! I went to pianist Richard Clayderman's concert yesterday and I have a Berlingo Van that I usually sleep in to save money as I live in Guimarães and not in Lisbon. I spent a terrible night at this establishment due to the loud and non-stop sound. It is a situation of extreme lack of respect towards users.",1
Stay away!,"Just returned from Lisbon. Our hotel was overlooking Martim Moniz square and it's full of groups of men hanging around all day, some trying to sell you drugs - all very intimidating. The whole area smells strongly of urine. There is also a 'cardboard city' at one end and always lots of beggars around. The whole of Lisbon was a complete let down - mostly dirty, scruffy and covered in horrid graffiti - nothing appealing here and will never return - once was enough.",1
V noci tu sami nechoďte,"Tady jsem se octnul, když jsem šel pěšky z vyhlídky Senhora do Monte zpět do centra města. Už jak jsem procházel těmi uličkami, no tady bych sám v noci nešel. Na samotném náměstí spousta pofiderních lidí. Tady jsem se necítil příjemně a už vůbec ne bezpečně. Hlavně, že tu stojí jeden z nejdražších hotelů ve městě, vážně úžasný.",1
Not worth it and scary,"Except for the tram 28, and that near the castle of St. George, has nothing for which I would recommend to visit, we saw many people drugged and selling. We passed through streets that were scary and we didn't feel safe. Wouldn't recommend it especially late afternoon/night",2
Better avoid!,"If you want to eat authentic Asian food during the day, this is certainly a great place to go. But this kind of multiculti of groups of men loitering around is frightening. Unfortunately, you can't get around it to get to the hospital São José on foot, for example. At night I would definitely not go there and I feel sorry for tourists who have booked accommodation from provided there or even worse Above direction Intente/ Avenida Almirante Reis ! This is definitely not a poster child for Lisbon.",2
It's really scary coming here.,"This square is very central. You have to come here to catch Tram 28. The atmosphere is really terrifying. People from early morning to evening sitting around doing nothing. You see the same people in the same place at 9 in the morning as at 9 at night. They call you, they tell you things, they offer you things. I felt absolutely not safe in this area to go 2 women. All full of shops and bars from other countries.",1
99.9% migrants in flip flops loitering around,As the title suggests… that and homeless people. Been through in the evening as well where you see migrants eating basmati rice out of carrier bags with their hands. Does not look like Portugal. It’s gone and abandoned by the locals. Gone.,1
"Not what it used to be, skip this place at night","We had an appartement closeby so we walked here almost daily. Based on the reviews and description, I believe this place is not what it used to be. There were no markets and at night there were a lot of immigrants and homeless people. Since I was with my partner I still felt safe/at ease, but I think that I would've felt unsafe/not at ease with a female friend. There is a pretty decent supermarket for an easy breakfast/lunch.",2
Dirty and poorly cared for,"The square would not be ugly, but we found it poorly maintained and poorly attended.
The fountains were off, the flower beds left to themselves and in general it was not very clean.
To be avoided.",2
A hub for the homeless!,"I wouldn’t recommend visiting this area, especially not at night, it’s a hub for the homeless and unsavoury types and we were even warned to be careful by our taxi driver. Safe to say we quickly got out of that area or at least tried to, we jumped into another taxi but the driver blatantly made things difficult for us and clearly didn’t want to take us anywhere and I’ll admit I have slammed the door of a few taxis since being in Lisbon and by this time, in this area I had had enough. Please please don’t go to this area, it is not worth it!",1
Avoid,This is NOT a great place in Lisbon. Run down square full of trash and homeless people. There is really nothing to do here. There are wonderful squares just to the southwest. Much nicer with shops and cleaner.,2
Place without any charm,This place is no longer occupied by any stalls or businesses. Only status in the middle can be worth it. Place which may not be very busy depending on schedules,2
"Be careful, great social degradation","A degraded and poorly frequented square. I saw people urinating in front of everyone as if nothing had happened at 5pm, people selling drugs without problems. Be careful if you end up in these parts for tram 28 and 12, stay away from the central part of the square",1
Unsafe!!!,Feels very unsafe at night. Didn’t see a single woman on the road around 11pm while I got home. The area was full of sketchy men staring at you and whistling/catcalling - I felt very unsafe. This isnt an exaggeration. I wouldnt recommend staying here if you’re female and travelling solo,1
"Gathering of homeless people, drug addicts, illegals....","The square was filled with homeless people, drug addicts and illegals. The bushes at the park were used as a public toilet. No visible police.",1
Buyer beware,"Prices for tours are much lower than competition. Now I know why - received an email requesting deposit by pay pal and then remainder of payment for 8 day tour of 2600 euro in CASH TO the driver. Probably how they keep their costs down, but I don't travel with that much cash and won't deal with a company that works that way. Buyer beware.",2
Worst tour ever,"This tour was far from being Premiere!!
Showed up in a 1990s Mercedes and the aircon was barely working when we got going. As the day heated up, the aircon stopped all together. Had to drive around with the windows down. Too hot for that. Asked the driver to abandon the tour after four hours of stinking heat. Rang the office and the only solution offered was to get another car and start again. Way too hot for that now.
Management flipped the blame to the customer. That I should have rung him and reported it. Thought that was the drivers job as the coolant light came on in the first hour. And he did report it.

Ruined one of our last days in Lisbon!

Do not book with these guys. All about keeping the cash!!",1
Replacement tablecloth never happened; No help from the shop as I sent photos of the rewoven areas.,"September, 2022 I was so excited to find this shop as I was looking for a white tablecloth to bring back to Virginia. From the website I thought I might not be able to afford one but found one and paid cash for it. Unfortunately I got home with no receipt in my bag and the tablecloth had several rewoven spots in it plus some minute holes. I e-mailed the shop and they said they would get one out right away but it turned out they were not going to mail me one until I sent mine back at my own expense. I mailed it through Pak Mail and it cleared customs but sat in Lisbon since last November 10th, 2022. A return was requested and it finally arrived back in Norfolk, Virginia and the executive administrator for the VMFA was going to take it to Lisbon today, September 1st, 2023 as they were going back to this same hotel. However the shop owner or his granddaughter needed to pick it up at the hotel. I was not going to spend over $100.00 to send it back by DHL or Fed X. Well, they never answered my e-mails. Just a terrible experience when it was a lovely shop and some lovely linens. Beware of what you are buying and don't expect them to take care of something if there is a problem. Much disappointment for me.",1
Disappointing,"Music was not what we expected - 80s and 90s Muzak, and whisky sour was premixed which is a no-no for a good cocktail bar. Fun quirky decor though.",2
Horrible staff,"What kind of staff do you want to have in a place like this one? It deserves better.
One of the waiters spent 10 minutes outside while clients are waiting talking about her lovers and screaming some dirty words.
Non professional.
What a shame.",1
NOT INCLUSIVE OF QUEER PEOPLE,"I've been sitting at a table with my boyfriend for an hour when the waiter approaches, claims he has nothing against us BUT tells us we have to stop the ""movements"" (I assume he was referring to some innocent displays of affection). He also states that he has done ""much worse things"" in the same place where we were sitting, but with the bar as empty as it was that night, we couldn't have such ""movements"" because ""customers might complain"" and the boss had already noticed also.
On leaving, we ask the boss for the Complaints Book, who just tells us ""that's up to my colleague"", leaving. He approached us to question what had happened only when the complaint was practically completed, without ever, at any time, trying to compensate us or explain the situation to us. On the other hand, the waiter tried to offer us a drink which, in my opinion, is an admission of guilt.
I can guarantee that my boyfriend and I did not go beyond occasional kisses that would also be completely appropriate in public and family spaces, which leads me to believe that the problem was that there were two boys and, therefore, an act of HOMOPHOBIA.",1
DO NOT GO. HORRIBLE!!!,"Horrible!!!
You are rude and prejudiced!!!
They did not allow a 22-year-old boy to be in the establishment (just because he had trisomy 21)",1
Bar not inclusive!,"I went to this bar, which I went to many times, with a group of friends, one of whom was accompanied by her 22-year-old son. Because when we arrived we were ""advised"" not to go in because, firstly, she thought the ""kid"" was smaller and that he was very excited. He was told (the person who received us) that the so-called ""kid"" was not a minor and that he was actually 23. The big issue here is that, and once again, the so-called ""kid"" has Trisomy 21. He was accompanied by 5 adults, just like him. We tried to understand the reason for the very unfriendly and, in my opinion, very uninclusive reception, and the answer we were given, which was somewhat altered in a way, was one that had ""antiquities"" to protect! Moral of the story, not even the so-called ""much"" had changed, nor were there any antiquities to defend. Very unfriendly person. I was sorry I didn't write it in the complaints book. Everything this person can now respond to this comment in his defense is a pure lie!",1
"Bad welcome, dislike.","Antipathy on the part of the person in charge and her husband, who treat customers badly and do not seat customers when there is a table. Bad welcome.",1

Do not book if you are coming from Lisbon,"The traffic from Lisbon to Belem is horrendous for the sunset tour. We left with plenty of time but the traffic got progressively worse and worse. We contacted the company and kept them updated but they waited 15 min from departure time and left. We ended up arriving 5 min too late. The email with the information on the depature point was unclear because the photo was attached at the end and not embedded in the email where it said ‘here’ and so it was not
Obvious where the boarding point was. Doca de Belem is quotes a large area and the taxi dropped us off at the Yellow Boat area which was the wrong end and contributed to the lateness. The taxis will always assume that is the drop off area and there are NO signs for Pypas over there. Buyer beware when you are booking this tour and make sure you leave 2 hours to travel from central Lisbon if you book. You can see from the photo that there is no info on the boarding point. Don’t make our very expensive mistake.",1

Cheap Disney type of experience,"Not a museum as much as a cheap children's
Museum. I thought it would be about the history of Lisbon the quake and how it shaped the city. Instead it was gimmicky with cheap interactive devices. It references CA and Japan quakes ? Has a ridiculous quake simulation that is a mechanical floor just moving around. Its timed and you have to stay in a particular area for 10 minutes at a time. If you want to leave you have to ask and be escorted out

Staff seemed disinterested at best.

Waste of time and money",2
Nothing Special and Unclear When Buying,"I state that I am an avid museum visitor and leave a negative review reluctantly, but due.
I visited Portugal between late May and early June with my family (two adults, a child almost 5 years old and an infant). Wanting to avoid any queues, I searched for information online, and although it was not mandatory to buy the ticket in advance, it was strongly recommended, both for the presence of entrance timeslots (some already full), both for a discount in case of purchase the day before the visit, and by a nice BUY button that is the first thing you see when accessing the site.
I read that the visit was also suitable for children, so I bought tickets for two adults.
Too bad that once I arrived (a quarter of an hour in advance as always recommended on the site) I was told that access is forbidden to children under 4. Why is that? Company policy.
I asked how we could solve it and they told us that I could come in with my eldest son, and once I left my wife could come in. Comfortable, two solo visits that take up twice as much time.
I said I'd rather leave, and since I'd already paid, if they could refund me.
Of course there are no refunds.
I ended up visiting the museum only with my son while my wife waited.
Later I checked the FAQ and the age issue is explained unclearly. You see it better if you look carefully during the purchase, but it is easy to go further by simply thinking that under a certain age the price is reduced, under still it is free. I recommend putting a more visible alert.
Also you can always be wrong, I do not understand this rigidity in making refunds. I gave the money, if I leave without using a service it is quite logical and linear to return it. Also not in cash, you can refund the credit or prepaid card used at the purchase.
The museum itself consists of a semi-guided tour, in the sense that there are several rooms and you can continue in the next one only after a predetermined time has passed, so it lasts about an hour and a half with no way to speed up or slow down (you can stay longer in the last room).
There are several experiments, for example to visually explain how a tsunami arises, and the whole visit is focused on a sort of ""mission"" to travel through time and find lost documents. Not really my idea of a museum, but apart from my opinion, it is clear that it is aimed at children and teenagers, and for this reason I find it paradoxical that there is a minimum age to enter.
By the way, my son did enter, but he could not participate in a part of the visit, in which the earthquake inside a church is simulated during a mass. Sure, the benches were shaking a little, but nothing dramatic.
Moreover, the information along the entire route was not particularly thorough. I already knew this event well, but if you enter without knowing anything you learn little.",1
Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.,"Complete waste of time. Poor interaction and completely lacking in history.

Bad visuals. Scant information Rip off price for what it is.

Nothing. It is not worth visiting",1
Disappointment,"The idea is good, the realization much less on some workshops.
The timing is not good at all, adults would sometimes need time to spend on workshops, not up to the recommendations...
high price",2
Nice museum but really for small children,"Nice museum but really for primary school children. You definitely don't have to go here as an adult or young adult. Entrance fee of €33 is definitely disproportionate to what you see. Everything is recreated in rooms where you are locked up for 10 minutes each time. So you are not in charge of your pace and route.
People are friendly and everything is clean but really for small children.",2
"Expensive, too expensive","Strongly adverized ”museum” is more a commercial way to show an earhquake as a story. Interesting, but totally overpriced when knowing what else interesting is is Lisboa to see.

Young persons telling the ways to go and give information speak too quickly and are used to wverything but do not understand the information is new for customers. So it was a bit difficult to follow everything.

I would not pay this again. 15 euros would be enough.",2
Disappointing,"Disappointing, and exaggerated price for the experience. The stay in the rooms is too short to be able to explore them. I couldn't even see half the stations and felt like I was always being dispatched. The simulator was also far behind expectations. I do not recommend.",2
I can’t recommend this attraction. Kids might like it.,"If you’ve already visited all your places of interest in Lisbon, you might then consider Quake. Many people like it; we didn’t. The displays were not great and the shaking earthquake room is ridiculous. You get violently thrown around in hard wooden seats that is supposed to be like an earthquake. It’s a narrated tour with a silly theme that makes you part of a journey of discovery. It’s an attempt at Disney but not nearly as well done. Unless you want to get shaken around and listen to a contrived soundtrack, go online to learn about the earthquake. Finally, kids might it. Prepare to shell out a lot of Euros.",2
Disappointment,"What a disappointment!
It is defined as an immersive experience that allows to revive the earthquake of 1755 when in fact, and in short, it is an exhibition using videomapping.
I ended the visit quite disappointed.
As for the price of the ticket is exaggeratedly high for what is presented, does not justify.",1
Overpriced trap,"Tourist trap, unfortunately. Maybe more interesting for kids than for grown-ups even if I doubt about it as well.
The earthquake simulators are ridiculous and there are so many uninteresting info about politicians of the times of the earthquake.
I paid 24 euros for an 100 mins experience while walking around the neighborhood for free would be more entertaining.",1
This is a kids museum,"We went as two adult couples and the word we used to describe it was hokey. We thought this would be an interesting museum and we would learn some history about the Lisbon earthquake so we went but regretted going. If you are going with children, they will probably really enjoy it but this isn't an adult museum.",2
A big disappointment!,"The museum can only be visited at predetermined times and then only as a guided tour. The historical settings are only suitable for the film, but not for museum audiences. Overall badly done, very long-winded and boring. I have visited many museums before, but the Quake was by far the biggest disappointment!
Admission fees are simply a boldness.
Actually, no star at all, if that were possible.",1
Disappointing!,"This was possibly the lamest museum I have been to anywhere. Very disappointing. They could have done vastly more with the subject matter. The technology and visuals were poor, and the information scant.",1
Not for adults,"The place is pretty boring. A bit of childish communication from employees about security. There are many decorative things cheaply made with lights and audio which are not interesting. For my point of view the price for visiting such a place is too high for the value, as it is twice as expensive than some art gallery. Do not recommend going as un adult",2
Customer experience wasted by a visit time shipped! Disappointing at that Award.,"Fun museum that revives the seismic tragedy of November 1755 in Lisbon.
However, the time of the visit is imposed by the museum staff, and was shipped in 1h20 instead of 1h40 sold and hoped for.
In fact, we were unable to complete all the workshops due to a severe lack of time. This is really outrageous!
This spoiled our customer experience, and it wasn’t the ability to continue the experience offline using scanned QR-codes that improved it.
We much preferred Lisbon Stroy Center, Place du Commerce, 4 times cheaper, and without time limit!
With the desire to make the museum more profitable by shortening the visit time, do not be surprised to see its Rating decrease.",2
Useless Quake,"The staff is very prepared and super friendly. But the visit is very expensive, boring and useless. Waste of time. And in fact, nobody knows where this Quacke is, neither the taxi drivers nor the residents. Dedicate that lost time to getting lost in Lisbon.",2
"Pretentious, very time-consuming and impossible if you don't like the experience","Interactive museum with little interactivity, poor visual effects, slow explanations, perhaps only suitable for children, very expensive entry price compared to other incredible international museums by comparison (e.g. Expl. TEAM lab in Tokyo).
No possibility of leaving if the experience is not pleasant. Late. Boring",2
Complete disappointment,"Big disappointment, and accessibility is zero, the special effects are rubbish, I've seen museums like this in Portugal and I've never been disappointed",1
An experience to forget very quickly,An experience to forget very quickly. Way too expensive for what it is. We were extremely disappointed with this museum. The feeling it tries to give of an earthquake really failed. One has to wait a long time in each room until the next one is free. It is oppressively hot and there is a lack of oxygen. This is peasant magic.,2
Poor service and personal,"I came from far away with my family. They refused me access because I was carrying my baby (who sees nothing and hears nothing). I paid for my ticket for nothing, because of course they didn't want to reimburse me. Already 82€ for 4 people is excessive! No friendliness from the staff, no humanity from the manager. Not accommodating! It ruined our family time. My husband entered the museum with my two grown daughters.",1

Too costly for what you get and needs warnings for people with bad backs,"For an adult who loves science, and learning about earthquakes, tornadoes etc , I was disappointed. Too much slow time doing nothing. You go from room to room and read about or listen to info about various facts of Lisbon and the quake. It was a few minutes of learning followed by many minutes of boredom in each room. It could use some editing to make it more exciting and interesting.

If we had only done the earthquake room where you are sitting in cathedral pews during the simulated earthquake, and charged 5 euros just for that , it would have been fantastic. Otherwise it was way too expensive for the experience.

Being a doctor, I agree with another reviewer about the danger of the simulated quake. It could be very dangerous for people with osteoporosis (possible vertebral fractures) and spinal degenerative disc disease. The tour guide at the front very quickly stated that if anyone wants to sit on a bench in the back that doesn’t move, they could. But she was hard to understand and the statement was made very quickly right before the experience began. A more definitive warning with signs and speech would be prudent. I would also recommend big warning signs in the main lobby and that the ticket sellers mention this to each ticket buyer , especially the elderly.",2
No warning on dangers,"There is no warning.

WARNING:

This is an absolute NO for someone with back problems, mobility issues, young children, autism, sensory issues, light sensitivity, pregnant, or have a history of seizures. You are asked to sit in wooden hard benches and you are shaken for a three solid minutes. You cannot leave the rooms which are built like escape rooms. There are no bathrooms during the experience which last 1.5 hours. They heat you to experience the fires then the floods. We asked twice to be let out after injuries. They did not let us out. It cost 25 euros to get in. It is not worth the pain I am in. It blew my back out.",2
Stay away - so not worth it.,"This was one of the most sophomoric exhibits I have ever witnessed. It's a total disappointment from the amateurish lighting and poor performance of the ""employee/actors"" to the lack of true virtual reality technology I've seen employed to such great effect on other immersive displays. The Quake was a true tragedy and deserves a better treatment than what was done here. Plus, for the experience, its exhorbitently priced. My advice would be to go to the coach's museum next door.",1
Boring and expensive,"I found everything super boring considering how expensive it was.
It's not entertaining at all.
And as a tip, they should try to make the experience and treatment of customers better because you pay to have a good experience.",1
Rubbish!,"Interactive sections are rubbish. Boring, not educational and absolutely overpriced. Stay away from this tourist trap!",1
Too much too expensive and not that interesting,"Activity too, too, too (I can't repeat it enough) expensive for what it is. I think the people who gave it 5 stars haven't seen enough museums or countries to find this museum interesting. Even in the church room (the only one where there are supposedly effects), the only effects were the smells and the sound. At Disneyland alone, more than 20 years ago I attended a 3D show by far better where there were also tactile effects... Frankly to avoid we paid 100 euros and regretted it. If you still want to do it, buy the ticket 24 hours in advance, it will be a little cheaper.",1
Tourist trap,"A complete rip-off, considering the absurdly high price. Just a tourist trap, do not go there. Much better places in the city to learn about the earthquake.",2
Very overpriced & silly experience,"First off, my husband booked this and liked it. However, my 2 teenaged children and I thought it was so silly we couldn't help but laugh throughout the 1 hour & 40 minute experience. It was Euro 30 per person so was quite overpriced. The economics of this is not viable (noting the empty Coach Museum next door likely has a similar issue). We were a family of 4 & had approximately 12 people in our assigned group and you could see the venue accommodated not many more so I imagine there is not enough throughput to support this museum. Note, you are forced to pace your experience as you are closed into a series of rooms with your group. You must stay the entire 1 hr 40 minutes. This should be geared to children's school groups perhaps (but consider redesigning your lengthy stairs with no landing first). There is a flipping between space-age, futuristic rooms & historically designed sets which is confusing. Some of the information was interesting but the presentation was so overwrought & limited the experience.",1
"Expensive, not interesting","I did not enjoy this. I am a woman with an interest in history and geography. I didn’t learn anything new here, the info on tectonics and the interactive stuff is quite dull. The historical testimonials are invented. There are two earthquake simulations and neither is particularly interesting. The one in the church goes on too long and you have to remember this was a tragic event killing tens of thousands of people, and feels odd to try and make it “fun” like a theme park experience. Also you are stuck doing the whole 1 hour 40 minutes, you can’t leave. Way too expensive as well.",1
Big hyped up waist of time.,"This is the most overhyped and disappointing activity in Lisbon.
All smoke and mirrors, and NO value for money, not cheap either, and a total waist of time.
Un eganging and just plain boring, for a young ten and a adult thst are very open minded.
A big hype and not worth your time or money.
The staff was very on autopilot and disengaged, uninterested and non welcoming.
Not recommended and will not return.
Stay away much better options abd better value for money around.",1
Dececionante,"Forma ligeira e simplista de tratar a história da cidade. Publicidade espalhafatosa para a realidade modesta que o sítio oferece. Não deve ser confundido com um museu, mas para experiência - que é o que parece dominar os tempos e os projetos dedicados a turistas - é pouco inovadora. Não só as projeções de vídeo são grosseiras e pouco reais como as salas onde se tentam recriar tempos antigos são pouco convincentes. Há 30 anos as experiências deste género por essa Europa fora eram bastante superiores. Aliás, qualquer atração dentro da Eurodisney tem cenários mais convincentes.
Pessoalmente, não aprendi nada sobre o terramoto além do que sabia. Por tudo isto acho o preço absurdo. Na verdade não percebo como um barracão grande nas traseiras de tudo pode cobrar mais do que atrações verdadeiramente pedagógicas. Não recomendo.",2
Très décevant et trop cher.,"Le prix est très cher pour cette attraction. Il faut compter une trentaine d'euros par personne. Tarif exorbitant pour les portugais. Attraction décevante, ""effets spéciaux"" datés, valables il y a 30 ans ! Franchement très décevant.",2
A costly mistake,"I did not so what to expect with this tour. Was real short on time so hoped I could be in and out in maybe 45mins. I paid for the ticket with seemed a little pricey but it did come with good reviews. The agent then told me I wouldn’t be able to speed through it as I wished as the rooms opened gradually after a certain amount of time. She told me it would take an hour and a half. Realising my mistake, I apologised and said I would not be able to do it. I asked if I could have a refund. She told me this were not possible even though I had literally just paid for it. They let me just walk out the door having paid €30 without any shame or effort to apologise or refund me in any way.

Its for this reason it gets the 1 star. I thought this was so poor.",1
Very nice but way overpriced,"It was a nice experience. Carefully made with a lot of insights. However, there are a few drawbacks:
1. The tour is organized along a storyline. You cannot discover on your own but rather you're rushed from one room to another. The story is a good fit for children.
2. Its way overpriced. Don't get me wrong, I know that all the tech that is built in costs money. But 31 Euros for adults with no student or other discounts available is way too much.",2
"Tasteless, infantile and way overpriced.","Truly the biggest waste of 29 euros you can imagine. I can assume it would be enjoyable for anyone under the age of 12, but even then, it’s still wildly expensive. There’s about 15 minutes worth of information stretched out into a 90 minute experience that requires you to adhere to a strict timeline. Despite our desire to move on once we were done with a certain room, we had to wait. Toward the end of the tour, once we had heard for the 5th time the basic, Wikipedia-level details (actually, Wikipedia is far more informative than this exhibition) we wanted to leave the whole place early, but were prevented from doing so until it had ended. This is a ridiculously cheesy and infantile “museum” that transforms one of the greatest tragedies in Portuguese history into a tasteless, wannabe Disneyland experience. Avoid at all costs.",1
Very disappointing park,"This park is very small, the animals are parked in poorly maintained enclosures, some birds were dead, the green spaces are full of weeds, no signs, it is forbidden to touch the animals, everything is done in 15 minutes, fortunately it is is free and there is no parking.",1
Long waiting hours to visit,"We waited for 2 hours, long queue.. even thıugh you have a city pass you have to wait with the people who have tickets. Then you have the privilege to visit a small part of monastery. On the way out there was chaple which we couldnt visit cayse you have to wait another queue .. this is unrational and time consuming.. To visit a monastery you have to wait for two queues and pay two times.",2
Could do better,"Whilst the park is beautiful to look at, there was no information about the park, no interpretation of different areas, not disabled friendly, grumpy train driver . Dogs are not allowed on the train around the park. Bit disappointed",2
Oriented towards non-critical tourists,"The backing musicians were very hard and professional. The singer didn't spark. She just rinsed off her program and took a break of almost 15 minutes after just 20 minutes. There was no encore either. Measured by the entrance fee, a less than moderate event; it is more touristy and with little heart.",2
Lack of punctuality,"Good night, there is comfort inside the bus however there is a lack of professionalism on the part of the company when it comes to punctuality. I have walked several times and every time there is always a delay d and at least half an hour, a lack of respect!",1
Badly polite driver and offensive driving...,"We returned from Nazaré to Lisbon with this company, driver left late, started the trip with people standing, my wife fell on the stairs, another passenger sat in our place, I tried to change p/ sit with my wife, rough driver stopped the bus and made a fiasco, poorly polite. I complained at the company, they didn't give back. Choose to travel with the FLIXBUS, much better ....",1
,Waited a full hour for the bus to arrive after its due date and there was still nothing. Ended up needing to take a different bus to my destination.,1
Alentejo - Algarve: Bad experience,"Never take a bus from Alentejo to Algarve with this company. I had to change bus 3 times and wait half an hour in Albufeira because the driver caught traffic on the exit from Lisbon (without his fault), but I still took with a third change of transport between Portimão and Lagos after that. A trip that started at 17:15 from Évora, ended in the Algarve at 23:00. Just to forget. I think Flixbus is much more direct.",2

""I had booked a bus ticket from Coimbra to Porto with Red Express My bus was supposed to arrive at Porto at 6:45 PM. However, due to some reason, the driver did not know the correct route or perhaps did it intentionally and took the bus to Aveiro city The bus was delayed by an hour and only reached the airport at 7:40 PM, which left me with only 5 minutes to catch my flight. Despite my efforts, I was not allowed to board. As a result, I lost the 300-pound ticket. I want to file a complaint against Red Express for this issue. I am sending all the proofs, including the ticket I purchased at that moment. Please contact me.""",1
Dia 05 Julho viatura 23 09h15 Fátima/Lisboa,"Já é a segunda vez que faço uma avaliação negativa aos serviços dos motoristas da Rede Expressos. Frequentemente ao telemóvel, música do rádio alta, e falta total de educação e respeito pelos utentes.
Estas viagens frequentes entre Fátima/Lisboa/Fátima que deviam ser tranquilas mais parecem aventuras 😲",1
Unpleasant behaviours,(Bus) Drivers will never respect to passengers. No welcoming environment at all. Experienced unprofessional and cruel attitudes most of the time when use their services.,1
"Delay, dirt and bugs","I'd put 0 stars if I could. I went from Lisbon to Madrid on a bus that reached Paris. He arrived almost half an hour late, the line was not respected when he got in, the driver only checked the tickets to some people who got in, others did not, and he came screaming to everyone because we were ""late"", which was entirely the responsibility of the company when the bus arrived 20 minutes after the supposed departure time. That, however, was not the worst. When I got on board I noticed that the bus was incredibly dirty, which is amazing because they won't let you eat for the entire 7-hour journey. When I sat in the seat, I clearly saw several bugs walking on the seats and through the window curtains. Three weeks later, I noticed bed bugs in my house. The bus is very cheap but it wasn't worth it at all, it's a shame you didn't read the reviews before buying the ticket. I wouldn't come back even if I got the ride. If you have the opportunity to go with ANY OTHER COMPANY, whether it’s paying a lot more, do yourself the favor.",1
Dangerous Driving,"I traveled with my Yorkshire (2kg) to the Alentejo (Lisboa-village green of fist), the driver didn't want him to be next to me, when he paid a ticket too.The driver did not buy the schedule, was waiting for a passenger 20 minutes, with all the stunts and excess speed and various violations of the road code, we arrived with a 1h delay. It was the first and last time I already informed the authorities of what happened. I felt in danger. I highly recommend the kindness of the flixbus drivers and length of schedules",1
Physiological Needs,"Good afternoon.

I understand that toilet maintenance costs money. What I do not understand is that a customer of Rede Expressos has to pay for this service, since he is on a journey and paid for that trip. I have come to the conclusion that, the travel breaks, are all made in the Expressos network posts and never in service areas, as for example, it is policy of Flixbus.
With this policy, Rede Expressos ""mandates"" its customers, whenever they have physiological needs, to use the toilets of their stations and charges them the value of 1€. It's a very ""dirty"" game by the company.
I repeat, I understand that it is necessary to maintain the spaces, but when presenting the ticket the use should be free, as is in many establishments from the moment the customer consumes.
They are small acts, but get bad to Expressos Network, it's just a ""tax"" disguised.

A hug and good trip!",1
BIG FLOP NO AVAILABLE WC IN ALL THEIR BUSES,"BIG FLOP 👎👎👎I don’t recommend their service is the worst ever , I always take rede Expressos to move here in Portugal but always the same problem they don’t have toilet (WC) it’s always locked in every trip even for long trips of 5hours and more and the worst is they don’t stop for a break at least to look for a public WC",1
Terrible! Bus air conditioning not working.,The bus was on time however the air conditioning was not working and the entire trip (3 hours) felt like we were traveling in an oven. Horrible experience!,1
Terrible Service,"I was visiting Lisbon and had planned to take the train to Porto, but during my trip, the trains were on strike. Locals told me the buses were actually a better option anyway, so I decided to take the bus instead.

When I arrived at the station, I was a bit lost. Being new to the country, I wasn’t sure which bus to board—there were multiple buses labeled for Porto. I must have looked confused because someone kindly pointed me toward a machine where I could scan my ticket. It directed me to Bus 10.

Still unsure, I approached the driver of Bus 10 to confirm, but he was rude and dismissive. I hesitated, unsure if I should board. I noticed he wasn’t scanning tickets for anyone that had luggages in their hand so he was scanning tickets for people who had already stored their luggage’s. Instead of informing us he dismisses us. So I followed suit, loaded my luggage, and approached him again. This time he scanned my ticket without saying a word. I boarded the bus, hoping I was on the right one.

The ride from Lisbon to Porto is 3.5 hours. At some point, a few passengers needed to use the restroom, but it was locked. Two women had to protest and demand the driver stop so they could relieve themselves. Out of fear of being left behind, I stayed on the bus because bathroom lines were long so I had to hold my bladder for the remaining 1.5 hours of the trip.

Someone in a review had mentioned that tall people should reconsider this bus—now I understand why. I’m six feet tall, and thankfully, no one was seated next to me. Otherwise, my legs would’ve been incredibly cramped.

Overall, my experience was terrible. The bus driver was rude and unhelpful, and having no access to a restroom on such a long trip was unacceptable.

I hope you all see this review before you purchase your ticket and find alternative rides.",1
Worst company in Europe,The worst company in Europe. Drivers without training and education to deal with people. Usually late. Horrible service to all senses,1
:/ getting worse,"late 20 minutes and the bus seats do not correspond to those chosen when I bought online. I chose place the window, but does not correspond to the number and organization inside the bus",1
In need of so many improvements. Unprofessional.,Damaged seats in busses are not being repaired. Bus driver smoking a cigarette while serving clients blowing the smoke into the bus. Disgusting. Unprofessional.,1
"""Experiences with Rede Expressos: Closed Toilets and Poor Service""","While traveling from Lisbon Sete Rios to Porto Airport, I asked the driver to use the toilet, as it was closed. He informed me that it was not allowed, claiming they only open the toilet two hours after leaving the terminal, stating this as a general rule in Portugal. However, there appears to be no such rule in Portugal requiring this. I frequently use their buses, and they consistently refuse to open the toilet. Most notably, the bus drivers are often rude. I strongly recommend avoiding Rede Expressos buses unless no other options are available.""",1
Not recommended,"Not recommended.
On 14/02/2025 we were supposed to move from Zambujeira do Mar to Sines, via the 8:10 bus.
We were told by a girl that the ticket could also be made on the bus, so we didn't bother to do it on the internet and waited.
We found ourselves a very rude and annoyed person.
He ran me to the bar to go buy these tickets, then left before I went back.
My personal advice: stay away from it and use taxis instead.",1
Meeting schedules never happens,"I travel almost weekly with the Expressos Network and there is not a single day when the schedules are met. Delays range from 15min to 2h! Will it be so difficult to reformulate the schedules so that at least from time to time these are fulfilled?! And the relaxation with the situation and lack of respect for customers, both from the station staff and the drivers is impressive. The staff at the stations never know anything about the delays and the drivers stop in the middle of the trips where they are already late to change the driver or put on fuel and keep talking joyfully like nothing was. No more words for the Expressos network.",1
WC Miserable,"I have used the terminal and express network several times.
Sometimes ask for money for a basic need, like, use the toilet others do not. Some vwzes have soap others don't. Sometimes you can unload others not. Sometimes there's paper, there's pee on the floor, others don't.
Shameful bathrooms. Inside and outside the shy bathroom bus.
At the station there are two bathrooms available and only one is that is open and shamefully representative.
FINALLY. FINALLY.",1
"EXPRESS ROBE, that's what I call this company!","I scheduled a trip for January 19th, and by my mistake, I scheduled the time wrong. I find it shameful to only refund the ticket within 1h, and so I lost my money altogether.

The same day, already in Porto, I bought a ticket in Campanhã to go to the airport, at the ticket desk. I was told the pier where I should board, but to be aware that I could change... I was sitting on the pier that was indicated to me, showing on the respective screen the bus, until 2min passed (without exaggeration) after the indicated time. I asked the security, where I was told that the bus went to another pier, and had already left. It is very worth mentioning, that that bus did not go to that bridge, because another bus was there, no... that bridge was always empty!!! Not to mention I was traveling alone with super heavy bags!

Network of Expresses, what you do is not only a lack of sensitivity to customers, but also a ""smart"" way to earn extra money with customers who do not catch this bus, and have to buy another ticket!! I call it theft, be ashamed!!!!!",1
Horrible experience,"Horrible service. A shame for international tourism. I bought the ticket through the website the day before, the bus arrived late and when I presented the QR it showed that it was invalid. The driver didn't tell me why or what I should do and he pulled me out of the line. The lack of respect continued at the ticket sales counter where they did not offer me any help since they have nothing to do with online sales. In short, I lost the trip and had to buy another one through Flixbus, which left on time and without any problems due to the online purchase. Never again by Red Expressos.",1
Beaten by driver inside the bus,"Having traveled in the Express from 10:00H today on 23/01/2025 (matricula 76-SI-72) with a departure from Lisbon Sete Rios and destination to Torres Vedras I was assaulted by the driver (Brazilian) still inside the bus on arrival to the Torres Vedras Road Terminal with a
Cutting object having caused me several cuts in the right ear and surrounding area that needed treatment
in the emergency service of the West Hospital Center in Torres Vedras.
The assault was spotted by the fact that I pointed at him with my cell phone that I held with my right hand being
He was holding a folder with his left hand, telling him he was going to file a formal complaint for the fearful, aggressive and insecure way he was driving. It travelled the North-South Axis of Sete Rios to the end at more than 100km/h passing from one track to the other and on the descent ramp from the Grilo Tunnel to the A8 East for centimeters to hit the trace of a truck after a forced braking.
Formal complaint filed at PSP.
Think twice before you travel in this RE.",1
Rede Expressos-Not Express and No Bathroom,"I bought a nonstop bus ticket from Lisbon to Lagos. There were 4 stops before Lagos. There was no bathroom on the bus. Unfortunately I had the need to go to the bathroom for the entire trip of over 4 hours. It's probably worth the extra money to pay for an alternative transportation mode to be comfortable and truly travel nonstop

Today, January 13, 2025, with the tickets purchased for the value of 44€, for 08:00h with the destination of Régua, our arrival to the edge of the bus was exactly 08:00h, we pointed to the Exmo Mr. driver who was already inside the bus and who ignored us and ran off.
I asked for the exchange of the tickets, where I was asked to pay an extra 22€ for the exchange.
This is the system.",1
Network express bad character,"Site simply unusual, buy the ticket and want to cancel? forget, no matter the hours in advance you try to cancel will not be possible the refund and you simply lose the money. I don't recommend this service even to my worst enemy.",1
Bad for what they have in information,"Transport them without complaint. MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE GIRLS WHO HAVE WORKING AT THE INFORMATION POINT OF PORTO STATION, honestly it is very sad the lack of desire to help that they have already having ticket purchased. I needed to find my bus and I was coming from downstairs but I didn't know where to go or that... I don't know if it was because I didn't know how to speak the language but previously I have been able to communicate very well with other girls but well, they will treat them the same. NEFARIOUS",1
Can't!,"You have to pay to use the bathroom on the bus, unbelievable. I already paid for the bus ticket, what is that? They are corrupt pirates without shame!",1
Security? Not with the express network,"Choose your drivers better
the chauffeur of the Red Express bus, with registration number 99 UB 88, who was driving the vehicle on the route that passes through Ferrel, at 17:49 on December 17, 2024. The incident occurred as follows: while I was driving along the same road as the bus, the driver of the vehicle in front of me did not seem to like the idea of being overtaken. When I reached a zone of rectitude, where it was safe to go past, I signaled my intention with a flash and started the manoeuvre. However, when I started bypassing, the bus driver deliberately started turning left, blocking me and preventing me from continuing bypassing on the straight where we were. Thus, my vehicle was forced to deviate to the lane from the left, having the wheels out of the road",1
Lack of hygiene and sympathy.,"Very bad experience on a trip from Lisbon to the Algarve. The bus cleaning was very bad, not to say inexistent! It was very unpleasant to sit in two places so dirty (as you can see in the photographs). I have never traveled on a bus (or train) so dirty! Indescribable. The driver also owed nothing to sympathy. At a 10-minute stop at a service station on the highway, I requested access to my luggage to take out a power bank. The answer was: ""If I let him do this, I'll have to do it to everybody."" Looking around, only there was me and the driver himself!!! Unbelievable such evil will! It was definitely the last trip I made at this company. No doubt the train is a much better alternative. It's a pity. The trip was made on December 9, 2024, with a departure from Lisbon at 18:30 to Olhão, and the bus was number 93.",1
Pay to enjoy the bathroom.,"Having paid for the trip and still not being enough to be able to use the bathroom is not reasonable. Especially in today's times, where many people already use card instead of money, asking for a euro coin is asking for no one to use the bathroom.",1
Rough and incompetent driver!!!!,"Today had a terrible experience with this company. The bus driver been just crazy and absolutely incompetent!
It was a Porto-Viseu direction at 18:00
First of all the way he speaks to my sister was un politely and rough. When she asked him to wait for me for a minute( because first of all he got late for 10 minutes and changed the line of departure after he came) he refused and closed the door right in front of my nose!",1
Site and app not working,"The website and app are not working. I can't buy tickets for these channels. Is there any restriction for access outside of Portugal?
Is there any way for people outside Europe to buy tickets?",2
Very bad,"They go away and leave the passengers sick knowing they have passengers for this journey. In Porto, it sometimes does not appear on the screen from where a vehicle departs, which leads to misleading and people lose the journey. If people are not alert, easily order their vehicles",1
Scared and Hopeless,"Worst customer care ever. The staff in Fatima station is a disgusting person. I got off at the station to fill some water but when I came out the bus had already left. I asked him if it had really left and showed him the ticket on myRNE app. He says ""this is not a ticket!! Get a new one!"" My bag will all the important stuffs were left on the bus. I called the customer care more than 20 times, no answer. Tried to ask the staff for any contact for the conductor of that bus (the bus was 50A from lisbon to porto), he was so irritated to even reply to me. (Not so irritated to grab the woman staff working there which I happened to see him doing). I bought another ticket to porto but there was no trace of 50A. Tried to ask every other conductor if they had any contact or information as there was no office of redeexpressos at porto, no help.

Its been more than 10 days since I filled out the lost and found form, as thats the only thing they could suggest, I am still waiting.

P.S. the reason I got off at Fatima was because on the same day when I travelled from Faro to Lison on rede expressos, the bus had also stopped for a break and the driver counted every passengers and made sure everyone was present before leaving. It was a mistake to trust that pattern.",1
What the trick with the tickets prices offline?,"I had a good long experience with Rede until today, when I bought ticket twice more expensive in the Porto's tickets office.

Used offline purchase instead of online, because Rede website blocked me with 403 error.

When I finally found the wifi and checked the website, I figured out that ticket costs the half of money I spent.
So, 2 stars because of previous fine experience.
But in the future I would rather use Flixbus.",2
Do not use this bus company at any cost -Drivers🤔🤔,"My grandson travelling back to Sines where he lives had the infortunate problem with Rede express which left him stranded on a Sunday evening ,until the afternoon of the following day-missing a day at school.I unfortunately booked the ticket and unkowingly did the wrong date! When he asked the bus driver if he had free seats the answer was yes,so he asked him if he could wait 2mintes while he walked 30seconds to the ticket office to buy a ticket! the driver could see he was walking to the office to buy a new ticket ,in Lagos its such a small terminal and a small office! he could have easily just shouted to the office,or even better been able to pay on the bus!! Anyway as he was walking to pay for another ticket the bus driver drove off and left him stranded!!! Great customer service👏👏👏👏👏👏What is happening to people in general -no help from anybody!!!!",1
Totally Incompetent Customer Service - phone or email,"Booked a ticket from Porto to Oliveira do Hospital, via Coimbra.

Called again, without success - although the lady told me she would send an internal email and ask the manager to check.
Today, almost 3 months later (!!) called again and the Lady tells me I should try with their ""Encomendas"" department at the Sete Rios station in Lisbon.
This nice lady told me again that she would send an internal email...

Point is: does someone feel like taking care of their customers in this company?
The tablet is probably lost - but it would nice at least to hear from them.",1
Rede expressos worst traveling experience ever!,"This is my first review ever, but I feel like I have to. Rede express has been my worst experience traveling so far. Campagnha station has the most unclear and arrogant people working there who don’t want to help you. Every bus driver I asked to help me from Rede Express said something different and now I have missed 3 busses. You would think you would get some kind of reimbursement or extra help or something after this terrible service. Worst experience I have ever had on a bus, disgusted with the service of Rede",1
Lost and found,"Bad, they don't solve anything lost and found. In the background yesterday there was only one person in the case my boyfriend,forgotten a bag with almost 500€ in an envelope and the rest of the money in the wallet. The bag appeared in another accent in the morning and no one knows of anything that hell has no camera inside, but the money from the wallet remained, I think if I was a passenger I would take everything. Since you don't have a camera nobody would know. He was a student and his life depended on the cost to pay his tuition, he was there and cried that not a baby, they said to forget the money. And in the same bus was found a tablet, how did you find the night tablet and the morning bag? And why didn't the passenger take a watch and the rest of the value? There are so many questions and the driver who made the last trip is not reviewed finally the money ends the same",1
Bad experience,Very disappointed bus. No proper Ac in the bus 4 hours messy driving skills. The whole journey was terrible. Never recommend any one for their journey.,1
Malisimo very bad,"Os motorists são rudes e meu ônibus saiu 40 minutes late, very bad service, the drivers are very rudes, they are very bad, the drivers and my bus left 40 minutes late",1

Very bad service not recommended,"Bad service, APP with errors, not sending ticket only invoice, driver who says has nothing to do with the RNE and sockets that do not work .....only incompetence and very bad service and still it seems that it is me that create problems , a sadness...",1
Horrendous service.,"Without a doubt the worst and rudest staff I've come across. When looking for information the staff member didn't even look up. I had accidentally bought the wrong destination online and even though I paid more for this destination than the one I required they refused to change the ticket for me. When buying my new ticket I walked up to the window, the staff member was reading a book and did not look up even though she knew I was there. When I said hello she rolled her eyes and eventually looked up. I went to another information stand to ask where to get my bus from and the lady just started shouting that my seat number was number 10.

This treatment of customers is unacceptable",1
Driver without professionalism,"Good afternoon.
I come by this means to complain about the service performed on August 24. That day I got up at 6:00 to take a flight to Lisbon, arrived and went to lunch in a hurry because I had my bus ticket for 15:15. The time came and we were informed that because of an accident the bus was late. The solution was to take us to Seven Rios station to take a bus at 16h to Lagos. Until then all right, delays happen, but when arriving at the station of seven Rios the driver who was in service was very unprofessional and rude to us. The delay was not enough yet we were forced to wait for all the other passengers who were on their schedule and the bus of departure to sit and we who were late still had to wait to be able to sit in the vacant seats without a minimum apology and understanding. We were told we could sit anywhere. Me and my boyfriend (he ticket nr 5105072812) as usual we wanted to go together as it was supposed so we sat right in the front seat that was vacant. The bus followed and stopped in Almada where more passengers entered, to which a girl who asked me for the seat because I had paid to sit there. I understand that you paid but I also paid, and I refused to leave making me feel embarrassed to want to take the trip next to my boyfriend and as if I was wrong...The girl and the driver were arguing with us that she should go out for you to sit in her place. Besides this there was also a passenger who embarked wrong, wanted to go to Lamego and followed the one in Lagos, this because there was no check of the tickets, we entered without being verified anything. This customer (India ethnic) was thrown out at the gas station of Palmela and by the words of the driver “the monhé that unravel”. Then we made a stop in Grandola for 20 minutes, even the customers complaining that we were already out of schedule the driver replied that it would be 20 or even could be 25 minutes...
At the end we arrived at Lagos at 22:00 where the starting time was 18:35. I could no longer get a package I needed to take on Monday morning because the store closed at 7 pm and now only Monday afternoon I can get it. A very bad experience and I will definitely not use renex / express network anymore. I will prefer to go at another time or even pay more than to use this company that in response to a delay, which I know it can be to anyone, treats customers who come from a late bus below others who are within their time, when they should try to reward them and treat them with sympathy and respect.",1
Bad.,"Uncomfortable and outdated bus. On the ticket, it says it has Wi-Fi and socket to charge the phone, and none of the options were available. Rude and poorly polite driver who found it right to stop the bus in the middle of the highway to complain with a passenger. Bad.",1
"Quality, responsibility, punctuality.","Drove from Lagos to Lisbon for work. The bus was 1 hour and 45 minutes late. What was striking was that the driver, despite being extremely late , did not reduce by a minute the time he stopped - 15 minutes. It was the same on the way back. Only the stop was not scheduled, the driver got up in Portimao for 30 minutes, eventually the bus was also 1 hour and 45 minutes late. The driver just left the bus to smoke, chat, relax. We were all waiting for him. My husband met me at the bus station in Lagusa and waited 1 hour and 45 minutes.
It's incredible brazenness and audacity to provide such a passenger service.",1
Delays on arrival time,"I have picked up hundreds of times express buses, and there is almost no time where there are no delays with respect to the time of arrival estimated by them. It's ridiculous, after 8 years riding the expressed network this continues to happen. I have already made Trips to the north, south and interior of Portugal and it is almost always the same thing. A rough estimate, they manage to meet the arrival time on 1 out of 10 Trips.",2
Buses never again. The train is much better,"Horrible journey, uncomfortable, with swings and with immense delay between Lagos and Lisbon. The air conditioning was not working properly, there was not enough seating space, there were passengers vomiting. The after-sales service is degrading, have no attention with the customer just despise the same.
I usually use the train mostly and none of this happens. On the train travel is much more comfortable, fast and safe. The train is a quality service.",1
Hello to be frank I did not travel with this company fortunately because when I see the behavior of,Hello to be frank I did not travel with this company fortunately because when I see the behavior of their driver on the IC8 road in Portugal he passes us by the right on the lane of the vehicles to after cut us the left road while I went to pass him a real crazy driver the bus number is 565,1
Unacceptable,"Ridiculous, I don't understand how you pay for a service and still have to pay 1€ to go to the bathroom. After a trip that delayed 2h30, reaching 5h30, the bus never stopped at a service station to go to the bathroom. We lost the connecting bus and at the station also paid 1€ to use the bathroom and then on the bus that revalidated my ticket (1h30 after the initial call) also did not stop at any time and had no bathroom. I was almost 9h on the trip and hope you don't have to go to the bathroom?????? Or better, that I pay 1€ to use the bathroom on a service I paid for? Ridiculous.",1
Worst bus experience ever,"Worst trip ever. Driver was racist and rude. He stopped in the middle of the road and told a couple of Nepalese guys that if they were to use their phones he would kick them out of the bus. He was yelling the whole first 20 minutes of our drive and was talking on the micrphone while driving which I don’t find safe at all for someone who didn’t let passengers use their phones because of ""safety"". All in all I highly recommend avoiding traveling with rede express. I felt unsafe and very uncomfortable during the whole trip.",1
Express network,"Although there were 3 pairs of seats in front empty, driver did not allow us to change seats (we were at 51 and 52, the last of the background).
When he noticed our presence in front of him he reacted aggressively and rude, even after explaining that he was claustrophobic, and he roughly asked if he wanted me to call the INEM. He threatened to call the police. He almost stopped the bus even after telling her we were going back to our seats.
For this driver the rules (in this case absurd) are more important than the well-being of the passengers.
Speaking of the rules, he did not announce that the seat belt was mandatory - I think that tb is a rule - and even if he had done so I was sure he would not check... since in this he is not the only one. So there are rules that are to comply even absurd and at the expense of the passenger's well-being, and others...not even involving the safety of passengers...
Another rule not met, and not exclusive of this driver is to comply with the departure time, even as all passengers are already on the bus.",1
Bad reservation system and staff,"I bought tickets online. When returning, I had to change the time of return trip (from Fatima).
1- Telephone support takes too long.
2- I paid the extra cost for changing return time (revalidation) but they did not send me the new ticket.
3- At bus station (Fatima) the female employee did not know how to find my ticket. She kept saying it was made online, as if she did not know how to work with the system. Finally she found the ticket, after 10 min fussing around...",2
"Never again, dear Flixbus.","Asked very politely if they could open the toilet. The reaction of the bus driver could be more polite, in addition to that of a phone call during which one preserves on the highway.",1
Way too hot! No air-conditioning,"No air conditioning on the bus. One of the worst and hottest bus journeys I've had. It was disgustingly hot, everyone on the bus was struggling with the heat but the driver couldn't do anything about it.

I have been on older and cheaper busses and they have had air-conditioning above every seat.",1
Terrible,"No wifi, finding the bus was really difficult. All in all a terrible experience. I do not recommend. You could do so much better!",1
Rede expresso - problems!,"We bought tickets at the ticket booth for Leiria to Porto direct. The woman who sold us the tickets said she u senators my English, didn’t bother to clarify what I needed, was in her phone and looked as though I was bothering her by needing tickets and asking her to do her job! As a result, they would not let us in our bus because she had sold me child tickets not ‘jovem’. I gave her all the ages of the children and asked if she understood. She said yes annoyed that I continued to ask her if she understood me. When they wouldn’t let us on the bus, they refused to help us by allowing us to pay the difference so we wouldn’t miss our bus. It was their employee’s mistake and then they refused to fix it so we wouldn’t miss our bus. The bus left without us. We then had to push our way to the front of the line to get in the next bus which was not direct. Mistakes can be made but this company did not deal with their mistake as they should have. Next time - traveling with Flixbus! Or any other option.",1
Fake 5G advertising on buses!,"Internet doesn't work on buses. They advertise where they even mention the 5G network and not even 3G works. They have network signal, the data do not even see them!",1
Awful service,"The service is awful. Nobody gives out information, they're all unsympathetic. Nobody collaborates, they don't speak Spanish. There are almost no screens to see where the bus leaves. It's torture. The station is full of street dwellers. Very scary. There's nowhere to sit, nowhere to shelter. Tap drag the suitcase back and forth. All terrible. I hope I never come back!!!!",1
Aggression to passengers with infrasound in the sound system. for what?,"Isn't that Rede Expressos is sending infrasound sound (for those who don't know what the gentlemen do to get people out of the house, it's unheard and it hurts the ears) by the sound system, to the customers? What is this for?! Someone understands, gentlemen! Highly incomprehensible and liegal, an assault.",1
Horrible.,"Horrible. Lack of consideration for who works. I bought the ticket and they didn't send me anything to the email. I sent emails, they didn't answer me. I called a lot of times, they don't answer. When I tried to download the ticket came out a blank document. In the ticket stores it is not possible to load the ticket due to a system error.
Horrible, I do not recommend, on the contrary, I recommend not to use.
Driver also without any empathy or liking to help people, just communicate that you can do nothing and ignore what I was talking about.",1
Look at the little eur for cleaning the bathroom.,"Ridiculous at the level of ground support. Well, Our Lady, then in Fatima and I don't even talk about the famous euro to go to the bathroom, at least miss the lady of stupid explanations, alms only in the hall.",2
Ridiculous - Express Network (customer service),"In all the years that I have been using the express network, I have never before encountered so much inconsistency in the scope of services provided.
Bus yes, bus no, the bathrooms are locked and for the cost of 1 euro we can unlock the door and use the bathroom.
I mention again that this is bus every bus, because for the most part, you just need to ask the driver for the key and there's no problem.
On buses where the use of the bathroom is paid, most of them just steal the 1 euro coin they charge you and in the end, they don't give you access.
When this is mentioned to the driver, he assumes 0% responsibility and states that it is not the driver's problem, but the company's.
In the end, I had to urinate into a bottle next to the bathroom, not only because there was no functional bathroom, but also because there was no stop at a service area in the middle of a 4-hour journey.
Hopefully the bus was almost empty and I didn't shock anyone unnecessarily and maintained some dignity considering that the other option would be to urinate in my pants and down the seat.

This is to say, the lack of customer attention in a basic area such as having access to a bathroom is shameful and ridiculous.

I would have paid the euro, but the driver told me not to try because it wouldn't work and he would steal the coin.

Thankful for the driver's honesty, but I find it completely ridiculous that drivers don't have the power to open the door (if someone elderly or with limited mobility gets stuck in the bathroom, would the driver have to spend 1 euro to help? Or would they be stuck in the bathroom until you get to the next station?)

Here is what I think is a necessary complaint for a possible improvement in the services provided by transport companies in Portugal.

Once again, I repeat, ridiculous.

In the case of a pregnant woman, a child or someone like me who suffers from incontinence... this cannot remain as it is.

Thank you for your attention and happy travels.",1
If you can’t hold your pee for 4 hours avoid this company toilets always locked.,Toilets locked and driver wouldn’t allow us to use the public toilet he himself used halfway there. Four hours on a bus without a toilet is crazy. I now spend 300 euros on a taxi. Try FlixBus they have working toilets but don’t run as often.,1
Unbelievable to book us on a bus that didn't exist!!!,"Bought a bus ticket from Porto to Lisbon for 10:30. Tried to get on the 10:30 bus, they said wrong bus number. Went to information. Asked if we could get on the 11:30 bus which had our bus number...they said NO. We were told our bus we booked was an ""extra"" whatever that means and we could wait to see if it would show up. Wait where? Wait for how long? It wasn't listed on the scheduling board. In the end we had to pay 8 euros each to change to another bus from a bus that didn't exist!!!! Unacceptable!!",1
Don't recommend,"At the beginning was already a problem with the bags, where the driver didn't allow me to board with a backpack that wasn't completely full. Second driver said that we couldn't eat, drink in the bus and the bathroom required paying 1€, but the doors wouldn't open so it just ate the coin and the driver shrugged, said we need to go to the bathroom at the next stop and that the coin was lost,the driver was really unhelpful with the whole situation. The driver also said that we are required to use the seat belt however my seat belt didn't work. There is no outlet for charging. The AC didn't work but hey we had one bad light that worked at least. Wifi is slow. Also the trays were dirty. My trip was from Lisbon to Porto.",1
Terrible service!,"Terrible company! The bus driver, miss leaded me and other passengers saying it was not the correct bus!! We end up going to the ticket office asking why the bus was delayed, since it passed already 15 mits since the departure. They returned us the ticket price without any compensation. Never travel in this company, absolutely useless",1
Horrible driver!,"I took the bus heading to Lisbon from Porto on the 24th of April (bus nr. 23 to be exact).
The bus driver was super disrespectful ! Sorry for using this, but I got to say like it is.
Extremely rude for not speaking/understanding Portuguese and continuing to shout at me for the whole bus could hear even when he clearly knew I didn’t understand a word. (I’m not even sure what the fuss was all about!)

Please teach this specific driver how to go around with customers. What he did was in no way professional and sets a very bad image for the company and the country!",1
Trip Beja Lisbon 23.04.2024,"I booked a promo ticket to Lisbon for 3.90 a week before the trip, but the day before, having a lot of pain in my legs, I booked another ticket for 14 euros to have more space. The driver couldn't do it, scan the ticket, I showed the payment. I'm interested, go and complain to the ticket office, you couldn't do it either, I said - make me another ticket, the bus was leaving, I ran to show the other ticket, this one was fine, but I didn't want to sit in the bigger seat, I sat down ready to call the police if you told me came to say something, it's sad that people like that work for the public",1
Bad company,"Ignorant driver. The bus doesn't have a bathroom, when it stopped in Fatima it only took 5 minutes to go to the bathroom (it wasn't after getting off the bus that the driver counted the minutes before people got off the bus). A journey of almost 4 hours with a 5-minute stop. I went to the bathroom when I came back and he had already started. I was lucky that I managed to catch it before leaving the terminal. Now I'm returning by Flix bus and there have already been 2 express buses counting the bus. They walk like crazy and don't pay attention to their customers.",1
Of shame,"I would have a hard time explaining how disastrous our experience was. Of shame. I have not seen a driver as bad as the one we had from Zambujeira do Mar to Almograve on March 26, 2024 at 1630. If the company allows people like that, I will understand that it is just as responsible.",1
dirty station,"Escalators do not work and the elevators are in a deplorable condition. Absolutely terrible, this bus station in Sete Rios.",1
Impolite unjustified manners AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"From setubal to odemira bus n. 80 The bus driver obliged me to put my backpack in the bag store although it wasn't too big (half full 38 liters, 7 kilos, I just traveled with the airplane) and I told I just could put it on me and between my legs. Of course now aboard the bus is not so full of people and there's plenty of space. He was rude and misbehaving, it was raining and immediately told not to get on the bus. He asked in Portuguese where I was directed to (none of his business, it was clear he just asked it out of the blue) as if it wasn't clear I wasn't from here, I answered in English and he just made and awkward face. Never happened to me before in my entire life. I'm never using your services anymore, going to report it on as many reviews website as possible and if something should happen to my luggage you're going to hear from my lawyer soon. Shame on you.",1
Disgraceful company,"Disgraceful company, dishonest bus arrival times and lost and found items are a joke. Zero effort trying to find any lost item. Shameful. Start riding the Flixbus",1
Unfriendly staff,"Very, very unfriendly bus driver. Using the toilet costs extra and when I said that I didn't have any cash with me, the driver showed no mercy and just said that it wouldn't work. I find that pretty cheeky for a 4-hour bus ride.",1
Shameful,It is unacceptable to charge €1 for using the bathroom! A company that earns so much charges €1 for using the bathroom. Shameful. They don't stop and you still have to pay for the toilet,1
Customer Support doesn't work!,They haven't responded to the email with the refund request I made for weeks. When I call the customer service number I get an automatic response saying to send an email... but the problem is exactly that they don't respond to emails!,1
Worst Ticket Buying Experience,"The ticket buying experience in Evora was horrible. All the ticket machines were offline so everyone had to wait in a single line to buy tickets. After awhile the ticket person closed her window and all sales were halted for almost five minutes. No one could explain why. The likelihood of catching our scheduled bus diminished minute by minute.

Luckily when the window reopened we got our tickets and ran to our bus. We were the last to board as our driver flicked away his cigarette and climbed up behind us.

The bus ride itself was much a better experience than the ticket line. The drive back to Lisbon was smooth and uneventful and we actually feel asleep for part of the way. The seats were not too bad and the bus was not full.

There was a bathroom in the center of the bus and we watched one passenger approach the bus driver and came back with a key. Not sure why passengers just can’t freely use the restroom.

Overall Rede needs to improve their end to end service rider experience. Yes they have the lowest prices but don’t need to make it so stressful or difficult to use them.",2
Shameful,"Travel with flixbus first, here you pay €1 for using a bathroom that doesn't open, you get grumbles as a driver and buses from the other lady's time",1
Not a preferred travel option. Many other options.,"We reserved ahead of time and got a great ticket rate. However, the staff were a bit edgy, intolerant, irritated. Seats were small. Driver in Evora station was intolerant, unhelpful, irritated and yelling at people. The ride was fast, driver definitely negotiated tight turns and traffic in safe manner. Felt a bit like an entertainment ride being bounced around in the chairs, offered some comedy. Station in Lisbon was absolutely disgusting, filthy. Would not chose this method in future.",1
WC 50 cent on the bus,"WC 50 cent, ABSURD. I went by that compnay Porto-Madrid about 8 hours trip and WC on the bus coast 50 cent. If you have not coins you have in trouble.",1
A sadness,"We traveled from Lisbon to Algarve, Albufeira. We changed bus in Albufeira to Quarteira. Unfortunately, we forgot two notebooks from my daughter's 3rd year. She was doing her homework on the way..... We went everywhere to ask, in Faro, we called customer support, we already filled out the form.....zero. Nobody helped us find the notebooks. Apparently no one left them at any station. Someone really needed the 3rd year notebooks......or the driver simply threw them in the trash. 😡",2
WC out of service. Refund refusal,"Bus with toilet out of service and AC too hot with the hot air outlet near the feet, boiling.
I would also like to say that it is impossible to obtain travel reimbursements even if they try to do everything within the deadline stipulated by the company.",1
Unbelieving,"On December 28, 2023, I took an express bus at 9:30 towards Sete rios.
Leaving the pier right outside the door at 9:31 we were stopped for 30 minutes, possibly an accident.
Standing there
It was 9:31 a man arrived. in the rain asking please to come in.
There is which both drivers refused.
Extremely rude when enjoying it, even saying they couldn't open the bus door.
""Apamha Another""
Someone appealed to their humanity, but even so, adamant to the passengers' request, they left and looked at Mr. in the rain for 30 minutes.
You were certainly 1 minute late also because of this same accident.
Both nasty arrogant..... .
Even during this festive season, which is Christmas, where empathy and care for others are more evident for these two gentlemen. nothing moved them
(I must say it was right outside the pier)
Nothing deterred these beings.
We were all in disbelief, uncomfortable with the situation.
Anyway...
A good year to you
And more humanity please",1
Never use this bus service,"Terrible! Can't use the app without the tax number and the Portuguese mobile. Their ticket return DOESN'T WORK at all! I had to cancel my purchased ticket in advance, and they never replied to my email and the email reminder as well. So I never got a refund, as it was stated on their website.",1
2023 still no toilets at service!,The bus doesn't have toilet and some of the stops as well not! The stops with toilet you pay 1€ if you're not a human that needs to piss it is a very recommendable bus service.,1
Constant delays,"I think you have to be realistic with the schedules... I've never arrived on time... It's always 20 to 30 minutes later. So at least they should be honest with the timetables... I buy a ticket from my mother, I should arrive at 11pm... And at 11pm it's stopping in Albufeira... Really top... I even meet friendly people sometimes... But the service leaves a lot to be desired.",2
"Excessive zeal and intolerance, lack of professional kindness","Excessive zeal or ill will, I don't know, but a trip with approximately 30 people is all crowded together and when you realize
that no one else would enter until I left, I tried to sit further forward where there would be more space at a time when Covid still exists, the driver did not allow it and in a cold and intolerant way. I went to the place, I complied politely but it's regrettable...!

Bad service,After arriving 40 min late in Sao Bartolomeu de Messines the bus driver from the bus 90 Lagos to Lisbon I came into the bus and it was full so I seat down on the first seat but the bus driver made me change even dough there aren't any stops between Messines and Almada where I'm going. There was someone else sitting on my seat but I didn't made them change since I considered a waste of time. Busdrivers should be more worried about driving and arriving on time then where people are sitting and how much the tickets cost.,1

I was almost scammed to pay a fee when the company's bus was late,"I had a good bus ride from Lisbon to Porto. However, for our return trip the bus was late. The monitor first Saud it was 15 minutes late. On the PA system passengers are advised to keep looking at the monitors to find the depot number for the busses which are delayed. Long story short the bus eventually came but went to a totally different depot number from what was on monitor. We eventually found our bus and waited in line for our tickets to be scanned and were told there's an error message coming up and we need to visit the office (upstairs) to sort this out. We went and stood in a line for about 20 minutes. The attendant then informed us that our bus is late and THAT WE NEED TO PAY EXTRA TO BOARD ANOTHER BUS. I demanded to see a supervisor who reiterated the same thing. Reasoning with her that the company's bus was late and we cannot be charged. She was very nonchalant and at this point I became very irate and demanded to see someone else. She kept saying she don't work for the bus company and she can't help. When asked to see a bus representative, she shrugged "" a man in a blue shirt downstairs "". We returned to the depot and kept looking for a ""man in a blue shirt "". We got the assistance from 2 very nice security guards. We found the bus rep who was very adamant about us paying a fee to board another bus as we original bus already left. I was very insistent that I was paying no additional fee. I became loud and argumentative. Eventually we were allowed to board a bus to Lisbon. This was a very disturbing experience in a foreign country. I loved Portugal but this experience put a very different twist thereafter.",2
Beware of disgruntled bus driver with a bad case of portuguese halitosis,"Just asked this driver
if he was going to Leiria. Because I forgot to say Good Morning Mr. Driver first (I'm a 68 year old female senior), he went on a rampage and started yelling and screaming that there was still a thing called respect in Portugal. When I told him that I would complain, he dared me to take his picture so, here it is. This man needs a psychological evaluation before the safety of 50-60 Passengers is entrusted to him. Shame on Rede Nacional Expresso for allowing this type of behavior!",1
Bad experience,"Terrible experience in all ways.

-couldn’t book a ticket online and charged my card multiple times even though it said it failed and we got no tickets
-tried to buy tickets for us and bicycles at service desk and kiosk but neither worked, the system wouldn’t let ticket person complete the transaction. Ticket person said we could pay driver in cash
-when we tried to pay driver in cash he yelled at us and pushed our bikes then yelled more. A different driver explained that bikes needed to be in boxes, which is nowhere on website and was never expressed to us before the time of the bus.
-driver yelled at us some more. We couldn’t take the bus. We lost our money.

Not a good experience. Try a different bus company if you can.",1
Bad experience,"Easy access to tickets but terrible lack of information! The buses were not properly identified and the information on the signs did not correspond to the bus on the track! Not very helpful drivers, especially the one in vehicle 11 at half past midnight on 25.08.23 at the campaign station in Porto, who, when he interrupted his cigarette to ask for information, reacted in an extremely rude, cynical, rude and unpleasant way. as if he were doing me the biggest favor in the world when at the same time I was paying him his salary. It wasn't my bus but as a company employee I should have been willing to provide any type of information in a polite and helpful manner! It was enough to be in an unfamiliar area, at late hours, with information errors in the system and still have to deal with this attitude from the employee!",2
Bus driver with criminal behavior,"The bus driver, in addition to being rude, traveled late and on the journey from Covilhã »»»» Lisbon, with full capacity from Castelo Branco, he stopped for just 5 minutes (information provided by the driver, he left me at Castelo Branco station, as I went to the Wc (ladies), I point out that only 1 was in operation, at least 4 days ago (LISBOA trip »»» COVILHÂ) there was also a single Wc in operation, INADMISSIBLE for a station with these characteristics, and I had to walk to the BUS that had stopped at ROTUNDA SAIDA DA CIDADE!!! polytechnic students! Worse than transporting cattle!",2
Arrival at destination constantly delayed by at least 45 minutes.,"I take dozens of trips throughout the year Lisbon - Faro and vice versa. I've made trips at different times on more than 25 trips and the bus always arrives at least 40 minutes late. Either CHANGE the arrival time so as not to mislead people or stick to the times. Delays are unpredictable but this is too much, it is constantly almost an hour late.",2
Difficult to travel with your small dog in Portugal,"I travel with my little dog weighing 8kg, in her bag, she is used to moving around, she is good, silent, clean. And to get around Portugal I have to take the bus, I don't have a car.
During one of my trips, the driver refused to allow me to board with the bag containing my dog, he wanted me to put it in the hold, I asked kindly and insisted, it was impossible for me to leave her in the dark, alone .
He tells me that there are police at the roundabout...so impossible.
He feels no remorse, and no kindness.
Afterwards he tells me that I can pay for her seat, so I accept.....and they charge me for a child's ticket, and there it is possible to travel with her.
As you will see, we are not seated next to each other, but fortunately the gentleman agreed to take my dog's place so that she can stay close to me, thanks to him.
In Portugal, it is extremely difficult to travel with a dog, no one makes an effort, on the contrary only ""sticks in the wheels"".
Portugal is for abandonment and animal suffering! This company is a shame for acting this way towards animals.
When will this country evolve?
And since they have a monopoly on transport, I didn't leave the hostel on my next trips!
But I keep my dog, I will never abandon her.",1
High cornering speed,"Taken from Lisbon Sete Rios to Fatima Bus Station on 7 August 2023, departing at 4.30pm and arriving at 6.15pm. Hell of a trip! Reckless driver, without composure. High speed corners and cut corners. Zero responsibility.",1
The hassle on the bus,"A very bad memory, I took the bus towards Portimão.
The bus had to be direct.
He stopped for a 5 minute break.
Went to the bathroom with my 7 YEAR OLD daughter.
Back at the bus, he was no longer there. The driver left without us.
It was a hassle.",1
Bus without air conditioning,"Terrible journey from Lagos to Lisbon. Bus with broken air conditioning, with maximum capacity and temperature of 39 degrees, there was an oven.",1
Very uncomfortable trip,"Traveling with the express network is terribly uncomfortable, for starters, if you need to go to the bathroom, you will have to pay €1, as the ticket price does not include the use of the bathroom. Furthermore, the constant and freezing air conditioning can put you at risk of a cold or a sore throat. Therefore, if you are going to travel with the express network, equip yourself with a blanket and a €1 coin.",1
Horários nunca são cumpridos,"Há 2 anos que viajo com a empresa, fiz mais de 40 viagens e nunca cheguei com menos de 20 minutos de atraso. Continuo por falta de outra opção apesar da Flix Bus começar a ser uma alternativa pela pontualidade e preço.",2
Experiência Deplorável,"Minha experiência com a Rede Expressos durante a viagem de auto carro de Porto para Lisboa Sete Rios foi totalmente decepcionante. O motorista do autocarro, ao notar que o veículo estava sujo, começou a gritar com os passageiros, alegando que aquele não era lugar para as pessoas comerem e que não era a ""casa das pessoas"". Isso aconteceu mesmo com crianças presentes, criando um ambiente ameaçador para elas.

Além disso, durante uma breve paragem em Fátima, o motorista anunciou apenas 2 minutos para uso da casa de banho. Contudo, quando um casal de franceses decidiu comprar algo para comer, o motorista quase os deixou para trás e ainda os constrangeu, proibindo o senhor de entrar no autocarro com a comida adquirida. A senhora francesa ficou visivelmente amedrontada com a situação.

É inaceitável que os passageiros sejam tratados de forma tão desrespeitosa e discriminatória durante uma viagem de autocarro. Esperava um serviço de qualidade, mas infelizmente, a atitude do motorista estragou completamente a experiência.

Espero que a Rede Expressos tome medidas corretivas para garantir que esse tipo de comportamento não se repita e que todos os passageiros sejam tratados com respeito e cortesia.

[Seu Nome]",1
motorista descarado sem educação,"Da Rede Expressos, tive, até ao dia 18 de julho de 2023, sempre boa impressão.
Até que no dia 18 de julho, apanho um grunho de um motorista, malcriado, atrevido no tratamento..o facto de ter tb referido que se paga um euro para utilizar o w.c.
o facto de ir uma pessoa completamente execrável a falar ao telemóvel em vídeo chamada praticamente durante as 4 horas da viagem e o motorista nada fazer em defesa das pessoas que iam no autocarro..
houve quem tentasse silenciar essa pessoa, sem efeito... Posso dizer que começou mal e foi mau do início ao fim. No momento em que sai do autocarro, nem queria acreditar que o pesadelo de viagem tinha acabado.... uma vergonha... uma tristeza...",2
Só em último caso! Não cumprem o horário minimamente,"Atrasos constantes de 30min nem sao 5 nem 10… muito fraco mesmo, ando porque nao tenho outra opção..enfim",1
Serviço péssimo,"Cada vez está pior ,funcionários rudes.
Autocarro sem segurança, pois o cinto não funcionava.
Têm casa de banho e não a deixam usar ou seja pagamos por um serviço que não é completo.
Casa de banho treminal Albufeira um autêntico nojo ,que não dá boa imagem aos turistas.
A chegada sete rios um 1 euro para poder ir a casa de banho.
O mês passado fiz a mesma viagem e a reclamação que fiz por escrito e agora voltei a fazer a resposta é a mesma.",1
Fraco,"Lisboa para Monção, uma poca vergonha. Vão atestar I depósito em Viana do Castelo em vez de já terem o feito para a viagem? E nós que pagamos o serviço ainda temos de esperar por estas paradinhas. Não tem lógica. O tanque deveria ser atestado para a viagem e não durante a viagem",1
Pior viagem. Sem ar condicionado no verão,Se Deus quiser nunca mais viajarei de Rede Expressos. Uma viagem agora da Figueira da foz até Lisboa 2h40 sem ar condicionado é desumano. Um calor de matar. Tenho certeza que com uma frota de ônibus enorme dessa não teria necessidade disso.,1
Take a train instead,No washroom on board. Driver only stopped once for a washroom on 4hr drive. 5 minutes only to use the washroom. Wifi doesn’t work either. I would suggest to take a train instead.,1
Abusive staff,"On time was about the only good thing. Many of us were abused by an “enforcer” not the driver, who wouldn’t let us take on personal carry bags.",1
Asério RNE ??,"Agora até para ir á casa de banho dentro do autocarro tem que se pagar 1€ ....... ???????
No site diz que têm serviço de Wc. Assim sendo essa informação não está correta.",2
Muito Dececionada com o Terminal do Oriente,"Terminal Oriente, sem sala de espera, sem qualquer serviço de apoio, sem segurança.Tendo sido construida numa zona privilegiada como é possivel despresarem desta forma quem viaja.Expecialmente porque a Rede Expresso tornou-se o monopólio das viagens para o Sul do país.
Desorganização, na minha última viagem de Lisboa para o Algarve, foi-me dito que o autocarro das 21h estava lotado, só poderia viajar á 1h da manhã, esperar na rua, com indigentes, drogados, sem um bar de apoio, chegada de um voo internacional com mala grande, fiquei a pensar o que iria fazer, passado minutos veem chamar-ne para ir para o autocarro e dar 20€, entrei mesmo sem bilhete, só queria sair de lá.Afinal o autocarro apesar de ainda ter parado em 7 Rios, ainda foi com imensos lugares vazios para o Algarve.
A nossa capital, o nosso país merece condições adequadas.",1
Autocarro leiria-aveiro que comorar por dizer que iria demorar menos que 2 h e demorou 2h30,Maior transparência nos verdadeiros tempos de transporte de modo a que as pessoas possam organizar a sua vida e tempo de acordo com informação equivalente à realidade. Demorei 2h30 a fazer uma viagem que diziam demorar menos de 2 horas. Vergonhoso,1
Customer Service non-existent,"Terrible customer service. You can’t even ask the drivers simple questions such as “is this the right ticket: location” they refuse to help, and also give snark remarks. I get it, maybe you’re tired, maybe you had a long day, but is there really a need to be rude? Out of all of our interactions with public transport, and tourism staff in Portugal this by far was the worst.",1

Enviei este pedido à Rede Expressos através do meu registo. Resposta: será encaminhado e entraremos em contato. Nenhuma resposta apesar de vários pedidos! Não é assim que você trata os clientes!",1
Horrível,"Péssimo o facto de ter que se pagar por uma casa de banho depois de uma grande viagem em Sete Rios. Que nem fatura passam na hora. A rede expresso deveria garantir o acesso a todos a um wc com condições mínimas e de forma gratuita. Ridículo.

Os autocarros estão sempre sujos.",1
Racist driver,"The driver was very rude only with me ( black, Brazilian female) didn’t let me use the bathroom and scream at me when I asked for information.",1
Very bad customer service,Their customer service is the worst. 15 minutes long i waited for the guy to explain me how the lost & found works and he never did anything to help me. just said to translate the website to english? ridiculous,1
TERRIBLE,"Terrible service, punctuality is out the window. The busses have no windows and smell like piss. They offer wifi in the bus that does not work AT ALL. And if you try to speak anything other than portuguese to anyone on the staff team, they are rude as hell. Absolutely horrid experience.",1
Never use that bus company!!!,"When I was in Lisbon taking the bus to Nazare there was a problem with your system so I couldn’t change my ticket to another hour because your arrogant employee told me my ticket was already changed which indeed was not true. After all, I have never changed my ticket. After describing the issue to your employee and then going to the manager's office they didn’t help me and told me to buy another ticket so I had to do a formal written complaint at the operator manager's office. now, after more than 20 days, they told me that the ticket is not refundable and that’s all. They stole my money.",1
Overpriced nonsense,"Overblown and very expensive for what it is, the bar person (in honour of people that can make cocktails that’s all they were) put a cocktail in a whisky glass with more ice than I have ever had to make the cocktail look bigger, when I asked to take the ice out and put the drink in a cocktail glass , I got it back minus the ice with a pitifully small about of drink, they can only make what is on the menu and even that beyond a simple mixer , appears beyond them, worst bar I have been to in over 20 years , there are far better in Lisbon. Overpriced nonsense , made us wait over 15 mins before our 2 hour slot and then wanted us to leave after only 1.5 hours.",1
Avoid these scammers,"Tried contacting this place days in advance to cancel booking, and got no answer on the phone until the day of the booking over 3 hours in advance. They still charged a cancellation fee even though I had been trying to contact them over 48 hours in advance. What a scam!!!",1
Don't care about customer service / accessibility.,"Emailed the bar 11 days ago to see if they were accessible for wheelchair users - no reply.

Followed up and emailed again 4 days ago - again no reply.

Ignoring people who are asking for help to visit? Not ok.",1
45 minutes of torture before bailing,"Worst bar in Lisbon! Stay away. Super pretentious. Drinks are so bad they're almost funny. 4 of us went, none of us could believe how bad this place was. Will not return.",1
Not nice people,"Most unfriendly top 50 bar I have made contact with.
My hobby is to travel the world and try all the top 50’bars. Was excited to get a table. However suddenly it got cancelled 18 hours before with no explanation. Was asked to write to them. They never replied. A really unfriendly bunch. Avoid them if you can.
You are worth more.",1
Disappointing interaction,"We weren’t able to book, which is understandable but the arrogance and rudeness was totally unnecessary. Seem to think their world 50 status gives them the right to be condescending",1
Misleading - benefits from tourists,"Misleading communication. The seller indicated that they are very flexible and so 24h rental was a stretchable concept to 1-1.5h clearance. When we came back, there was immediate comment that we were an hour later. Directly also to pay extra, without discussion. Not friendly at all, once the sale was in.",1
Scooters lissabon,"Initially very satisfied, fine moped, seller very flexible when booking and made it appear that we could be an hour later, but when we brought the scooters in (an hour late) he made a big hassle and we had to pay a fine. So be very careful when you book here!",1
Disappointing experience,"We were a party of 4, and we booked the sunset sail and wine tour. We were the last to get on the boat and as a result we could only sit on the front of the sail boat which had a bean bag. The bean bag is big enough to accommodate 2 people, which meant 2 of us ended up on the floor. And that is how we spent the 2 hours, in the cold wind and nowhere else to go as none of the other passengers were willing to trade places. The only redeeming factor was the amazing crew who did their utmost to alleviate the situation. We have reached out to the tour company, and the excuse was that it’s what we booked. We do not believe that the sail boat can accommodate 12 people, and it was not clear that some passengers will need to be sitting on the floor.",2
Be aware - you don't get refund if rain out - even if voucher paperwork promises it!,"We cancelled two hours ahead of scheduled departure due rain. People in our hotel came running in with umbrellas canceling their outdoor tours as well. This tour stated it would refund in event of rain. However they did not hold to this agreement that was on our printed voucher. The local tour group said we had to get refund from Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor said they couldn't refund unless Local tour group admitted to rainout. It was not granted. Can't imagine a tour group going out in that rain! I would like to think Trip advisor would have refunded if Local group was honest with them.

Be aware that you can't trust you will get refund due to rain even if paperwork promises it!",1
"Nice trip, terrible organization!","On 12/31/2023 we went to the indicated meeting point. It was a corner of a building that had nothing to do with the boat trip. Google's georeferencing was also rough. Luckily we were intrigued by a long queue beyond the fence, outside the square. No indications, no signs, no one who spoke at least English, just a doorman who only nodded yes. Thanks to the people we understood that it was also our boarding, but there was only one huge queue for two different ships and excursions and no one knew which one was the right one. The workers had neither a barcode reader nor a lamp to read the names. Only thanks to our cell phones, after 50 minutes we managed to get on the right boat.",1
Extremely Unsafe and Unprofessional Guide Shauna— A Serious Liability to the Company,"I’ve joined over 80+ local experiences around the world, and this was by far the most dangerous and poorly handled one — solely due to the guide, Shauna.

From the start, I informed her it was my first time riding an electric bike. Instead of offering basic safety instruction or ensuring beginners were supported, she gave a rushed introduction of under 2 minutes and immediately took off — weaving through narrow, steep city-center roads shared by cars and pedestrians. I was left 3rd to last in a group of 10, unable to even see her tail light.

Within the first minute, I encountered a tourist who pretended to jump in front of my bike as a joke. I had to stop abruptly, unsure how to react. When I caught up, instead of asking if I was okay or what happened, Shauna loudly and sarcastically scolded me in front of the group: “You need to stay really close, okay? R-E-A-L-L-Y close.” — speaking to me like I didn’t understand English. Her lack of care or curiosity about a first-time rider’s safety was shocking.

But it got worse.

Mid-ride, my straight-leg pants got caught in the exposed bike chain. I nearly toppled sideways into a car lane — a life-threatening moment. Thankfully, two other participants saved me from falling under the wheels of a passing car. Shauna, who was 8 riders ahead, came back after the fact and simply said, “Oh, I didn’t see your pants! You should’ve tied them up. These bikes catch stuff easily.”
No warning. No pre-checks. No emergency training. Just a flimsy excuse.

This wasn’t just a bad experience — it was dangerous and deeply unprofessional.

To make matters worse, the tour overran by a full hour, ending at 7:55pm, mostly because Shauna wouldn’t stop talking about herself and her second master’s degree in sociology. Her self-absorption, lack of leadership, and disregard for safety protocols made the entire tour feel like a liability waiting to happen.

The bikes and the route were great. I have no issue with the company or its equipment. But Shauna should not be leading any tour involving traffic, equipment, or group coordination. She is inattentive, unsafe, and unfit for this role.

Avoid Shauna at all costs.",1
Frustrating,The tour company wasn't quite prepared...we got a late start by about 25 minutes and my bike seat wasn't adjusting properly. The tour guide's English wasn't quite as good as I would have liked! Had a hard time understanding him and it took him a long time to voice his thoughts. Lisbon is not an ideal place in my opinion for an e-bike tour. It is very very busy so there is a lot of stopping and starting and riding very slowly. Lots of people and traffic to navigate. Had to walk bike several times. I honestly think it would have been more fun to have a few places where we could just ride without stopping for more than a block.,2
Experienced Different Expectations,"This could be a fun and informative adventure. I have taken E-bike tours in Nice and Athens, both experiences memorable, which is why our family decided to do one in Lisbon.
The bikes were set out before we arrived, and everyone was friendly and enthusiastic. We got helmets and asked about our riding abilities. Unfortunately the women's bikes with easy leg passes shown on the website do not exist, so be prepared to pull leg over, which is fine except if you feel only comfortable with being about to get on and off easily.
No vests given either as picture shows. The guide was hasty at telling us about the gears and turbo option, maybe because we said we were familiar with ebikes. Unfortunately there was no riding around on flat surface to get oriented to bike or turbo, just right up a steep hill. All bikes are different, and it's essential and everyone prove to the guide responsible that the folks on the tour are proficient at riding, steering, changing the gears, using the turbo, and breaking. There were a few times that coming to a busy intersection, we came to a stop, but without keeping your hands on the breaks, the bike continues to lunge forward. Immediately I personally knew the turbo function was not going to be adequate for these hills. It has 3 levels, where the bikes I've had in the other experiences had 5. That level of power gives you the true confidence and support needed in steep hills like those in the Alfama neighborhood. My husband who rides everyday at home had difficulty on a few of the hills. I, being a large, but active woman, had challenges on almost every hill, which should not have been the case. Having to walk up the hill AND push the heavy bike, only made the experience much more difficult, and discouraging.
We passed areas that were attractive and would have liked to know more about, and stopped at areas too long that would have been better to pass up.
The guide was attentive to us all and encouraging to me to not give up, but with more information about the area, a 1/2 hour less, and more efficient e-bikes, I know we all would have enjoyed the experience so much better.",2
Waste of time,"Absolutely overrated, empty interiors, very long queues not only to enter but also to get on and off from one floor to another, which are still empty.",1
Do not book with this company,"After many attempts (instagram direct message, email, text, calling) I eventually managed to book a taxi ride with this company. At the indicated spot and on time, we waited for half an hour, but no-one showed up. They didn't pick up the phone or notify us in any way about a delay or cancellation. Because of this, we also missed our restaurant reservation. This was my birthday gift to my husband and I am gutted that it has been ruined. What a lack of respect. Do not book with this company.",1
VIP experience - avoid,"Being my birthday, being my first time in this space. I decided to buy the VIP pass. I'd be far from guessing that VIP was for Very Ignorant Portier. When I entered, I decided to the distraction caused by the person in front of me by the advanced state of drunkenness, the doorman only gave me the VIP bracelet and not a card. Being the first time in space, I did not know the need for this card. I consumed my three waters and at the exit I was faced with a fine for losing a card that I was never given.The help was nonexistent, the staff was horrible, even being sober. Avoid.",1
"SCAM, Charge without warning","Lousy record, they tell you free admission before 1:30 and reduced prices of consumption. We arrived for free before one and thirty so we went for free, WE DID NOT CONSUME and yet we were charged 12 euros. Which aren't worth it for the disk level they are. The guards are high-handed, they have a lousy deal.",1
Awful.,"Don't go, people are scammed. They put extra drinks and extra drinks on your card and on the way out they charge you. The manager is a girl with glasses, came and said she was only going to speak in Portuguese because we are in Portugal. We're Spanish and we didn't understand. They'd have to change the staff, especially her. Money not returned, nothing solved, racist, impertinent and ill-mannered. Don't go, it's not worth it.",1
Nothing recommended,"We were a group of Spaniards and they wanted to charge each one one one thing when we all consume the same, clearly they are not worth it and try to scam all the time, we were half an hour arguing so that we were not scammed and at least in the end we were not completely cheated but it was not profitable at all. The only good thing is that at least there was good music.",1
Full of slugs and con artists,If you're from outside they try to scam you at the door by overcharging you or without even explaining how it works as paid inside. It's also full of slugs that grope and touch you without your permission. I do not recommend it to anyone who comes to Lisbon.,1
Fake advertisement,"They create fake advertisement about night with free entrance on social medias and then they ask you to pay at the entrance and if you don't want to pay, bouncers gets really unpleasants and violents. Horrible experience.",1
HORRIBLE,"The worst night club in Lisbon. Body guards were super unpleasant and rude. They charged different prices according to your aspect, with no reason. DO NOT GO",1
Unsafe and violent towards women of color,"Staff are extremely violent and racist. They (the bouncer) choked someone I was with. Especially if you are a woman of color, don’t party here and do not give this establishment your hard earned euros! We must condemn violence.",1
waste of time,"This place is a joke. The staff are super rude and unprofessional. The place is very dirty. You won't enjoy it if you are in Lisbon. Don't try to visit it, it will be a waste of time",1
Terrible! Bad polite security,"I hated it. I went to space with my friends to dance and have fun but, unfortunately, it was just the opposite.
It was very tense, the security was feeling on us with a threatening air. The nightclub was almost empty, it had a maximum of 50 people (including the staff), and the security began to get involved with my group of friends because of some coats. You couldn't have your coats on the table, just a coat. I've always seen the security reprimand for everything and nothing, not just my group but the rest of the people.
In the end, this security (called Lino Almeida), grabbed my friend (a 27-year-old girl) and decided to expel her from the club for having a coat on a table. When he grabbed her he was super aggressive, to the point of grabbing her in the chest just to kick her out.
Terrible experience and I do not enter the establishment again!",1
WASTE of time...,"Drinks were terrible and prices were high.In mojito there was hardly any alcohol and there was no fresh mint. Worst experience in Lisbon...
DON'T WASTE TIME OR MONEY",1
Get a real doorman not security.,"So After working in the nightlife for 15 years in NY for the best clubs in the world , worked in fashion , Dj , I went to Rive Rouge for a InterNations meaning private event and the door security though I was not dressed properly because of his ignorance of fashion . So what is said in supposedly high class club they don 't even have real door person like in NY who is the one creating the beautiful ambiance and creating the vibe by letting the right people in. Here is another boring crowd nothing original . Really sad for the owner of Lux . No funky people, look like an office party . Before to open a club I recommend to learn from steve rebel, kenny Kenny, Steve Louis ,Wass , real door people from studio 54 , Tunnel. Life ,Marquis . Get a real doorman not security, someone who has a sense of fashion, who knows to recognize cool people.",1
Discrimination and prejudice,Highly prejudiced workers. I was refused entry because I was gay. They treated me super rudely and a security guard even pushed me. I had never suffered a homophobic attack at the entrance to a bar/nightclub. Disgusting.,1
Abuse and assault,"The worst experience of my life, I had it here today, when the “SECURITY” treated my friends and me like we were trash, they attacked me, suffocated me, when we tried to take out our cell phone to record what was happening, They took it away from us. As a Spaniard that I am, I recommend to everyone who reads this to never go. Obviously everything has been reported to the police, along with a medical report of the injuries and awaiting trial.",1
Terrible,"I hated it. I went to relax, dance. It was very tense, with the security guard always looking threatening. You couldn't have your suitcase on the table, just a vest. I saw the security guard always scolding other people for everything and nothing, and he didn't make me feel at all relaxed. I was always in tension because of that. I've never been to entertainment spaces where I felt this way, and I'm 50 years old. I've been to many, and outside the country, and it was the first time I saw something so unusual.",1
Horrible,"Xenophobic security guards, bad environment. After checking the guest list and informing the entrance fee, I was blocked because I was with two Mexican friends. After being stopped, I asked to speak to the manager and one of the security guards pushed me onto the public street! Disgusting attitudes! A criminal complaint was made to the police. These types of events are common in this place, disgusting!",1
Terrifying!!!!!!!!!!!,"They stopped two black people from entering because they were black and even called them ""unwanted customers""! Super rude, rude and super hyper mega expensive. The music was terrible. If you have epilepsy, don't go and anyone who doesn't have epilepsy don't go either as they will almost certainly have a mini epileptic attack. The drinks are not good and come hot.
Furthermore, I felt watched by the constant security guards on top of us.",1
Run away !!!,"Run away !!!

There were 10 of us for a bachelor party we had booked to make sure we could get in. (In hindsight we would have preferred not to be there!)
At the entrance to the club they give you one card per person. This card does not give you any extra drinks or services, it simply serves to rip you off. How ? I will explain to you: they give you the cards at the entrance and explain that if you lose it you will have to pay €50 per card. Except that we are not told at the entrance that this card is of no use to us inside the club. I wanted to use it for a drink. The waitress took it from me and asked me to pay for my drink but she didn't want to give me the card back. I had to argue to get it back! Their goal is to steal your card so they can scam you out of €50 (how do I know? 2 regulars explained to me how this deception took place. We were 10 men so I won't explain the short story of this affair to you if we don't We weren't warned in time!
The receptionists are not pleasant, rude. I don't speak Portuguese but Spanish and English very well and I can tell you that they don't care about the customers.
We were told that the club was full to bursting, we ended up with 30 people including my group! Just desperate.

The club opens at 1am so we take 5 bottles with my friends, so far so good. But the highlight of the show! The club closed at 4am! The bartender came to take the remaining bottles (2 bottles still closed) and took them to her bar at 3:30 a.m.! I went and asked why? And she tells me that the club closes at 4 a.m. so I ask for a refund and she refuses it (the bottles have not been opened) I decide to elbow my way to recover our dues with great difficulty I manage to negotiate that the we transfer our bottles to plastic bottles!

If I have only one piece of advice to give you, it’s to avoid this club!!",1
Terrible,"I would give zero if possible. Security limited itself to explaining why our friend, a member of the group, could not enter. He began to be aggressive towards the other members of the group. If it were possible I would give -1. Terrible service and environmenT.
Terrible service.

DO NOT ENTER.",1
Absolutely horrible,Absolutely horrible club. A lot of bar crawls end here but save your time and go to pink street or bairro alto instead,1
Terrible. Avoid at all costs.,"ABOID AVOID. terrible club and they charged us 15euro on the way out after 3 mins inside. Called the police and wouldn’t let us out of the foyer.
This place is awful. Don’t go",1
Vergonhoso,"Éramos 4 amigas, uma delas foi impedida de sair da discoteca pelo segurança Luís Tavares, pois alegava que a mesma não tinha pago o que que consumiu, à saída. Após a minha amiga mostrar o comprovativo de pagamento, o recibo de multibanco, não a deixaram sair. A funcionária Patrícia Lima, que efetuou esse mesmo pagamento, não quis ajudar e descartou-se. Os seguranças desadequados, a usarem a força física sem razão aparente. Recusaram-se a colaborar. Estabelecimento recusou-se a dar o livro de reclamações, demorando 20 min para o dar. Não aconselho este estabelecimento a ninguém e deveria fechar. Vergonhoso.",1
DO NOT GO,We went on a Saturday night and NOBODY was there. Bought thousands of dollars of bottle service before we went and we were still treated terribly. Staff is horrible and annoying and petty. The whole club is just set up so bad and it just straight up sucks. Please do not waste your time here!,1
Péssima experiência,"HORRÍVEL. Entramos à 1:30 um grupo de 10 pessoas por 12 € consumiveis cada um. Às 2:30 vimos as luzes acesas e dizer que há um problema técnico que arriscava a nossa saúde pois supostamente não cumpriam com uma norma de segurança e tínhamos que sair. Claro que esse risco de saúde não os impediu de nós cobrar o dinheiro, mas visto que havia muitas reclamações decidiram cobrar o que cada pessoa consumiu mais o bengaleiro (ridículo sendo que os 3€ de bengaleiro são de uma noite inteira e não supostamente de uma hora. Tinham ganho muito mais se não nos tivessem cobrado nada visto que foi um problema deles. Assim todos os que lá estavam de certeza que não voltam mais, pois nós somos os clientes e somos os únicos que não tiveram culpa de nada. Devido a esta situação as pessoas não tiveram para onde ir visto não haver transportes e àquela hora ser um balurdio para entrar em qualquer lado. Não recomendo pois não pensam nos clientes nem dos direitos do consumidor.",1
péssimo,"Má experiência, barraram dois amigos por serem estrangeiros ( nomeadamente brasileiro e peruano), e duas amigas portuguesas.
Extremamente desagradável, nunca mais lá voltamos, não aconselho, acho uma falta de respeito para com quem já tinha entrado, tivemos que pagar o dinheiro de entrada porque separaram o grupo.
Terrível, merece 0 em 10.
ps: dava 0 no trip advisor se tal fosse possível.",1
Péssima experiência,"Além de ser obrigatório comprar os bilhetes para entrada previamente e de, ainda assim, ter estado mais de 1h30 minutos à espera para entrar (venderam mais bilhetes do que o número de pessoas que aceitam e tivemos que esperar que saíssem clientes para entrar), foram altamente rudes, não nos esclarecendo as dúvidas que tínhamos em relação ao funcionamento do bar.",1
Disappointed with Lisbon Tour,Boring mechanical presentation. A lot of driving without seeing much and rivets that didn't allow for many photo stops. Wouldn't recommend. Disappointed and a lot of money.,2
They cancelled last minute,Trip was cancelled the day before we were scheduled to go on the tour. It was too late to make alternate plans by the time we saw the email.,1
Do not order from them,Do not ordered from these guys they can even find the place then when they ask if you wanna cancel and say test they bad talk you to skip,1
I went to take a break for a glass as usual with friends,Everything is much more expensive than last year.They asked for a slice and put the slice in the account without the knowledge of the customer.When I went to get satisfactions the person in charge was rude and still wanted to put the blame on the employee.I said that the person in charge was him and not the employee.Here the question was not for the euro that he wanted to return but a matter of principle.Because in Portugal it is forbidden to put the slice in the customer's account.I could give it or not.I will not return here anymore and I will tell my friends not to return there...,2
Small space high prices,"A small christmas market
Very over priced for everything I don't believe there was any vegetarian friendly food stalls or not that I saw
I think it's designed around family's spending loads of money with there kids
But no real value for money
It has a great atmosphere
But huge crowds make it uncomfortable
I will say that who ever put it all together
Done a great job overall place looks greet at night
But that's what your paying high prices for
You can buy the same things in shops down the street for a lot less hats bags scarfs bracelets ect have a look around first
Maybe pop in to local super market before and buy sweets chocolate drinks for the kids before you arrive it will save you alot of money",2
Disappointing christmas market,"This Christmas market was kind of disappointing. I thought it would be a lot bigger since it’s in the main square but Wonderland Lisboa was better than this. It’s your typical Christmas market selling over-priced souvenirs, bad food at a marked up price, and a few stalls selling alcohol. Thankfully, it was right by our hotel. I would have been mad if we went out of our way just to come here.",2
The worst,"A disappointment not to say anything else, the ridicule of the magazine made, men holding pq pants had to take off belts and suspenders and at the same time trying to take things inside the small backpacks or another is so dark there inside that there were children afraid.
IF THEY CLOSED, NOTHING WOULD BE LOST.",1
Bad service,"The girl who serves at the cafeteria is very rude, the service is slow and does not help you with what you ask. Dull, dark place.",1
Lamentable and useless,Lamentable. 10€ to see the wealth accumulated on so much misery! And misleading when you want to visit the Palace of Ajuda which is on the other side of the building.... A state scam! To flee,1
Do not go see this museum just outside the Palacio,"what a scam
7 euros to enter an all-black maze with very little lighting, even the jewelry in the armored display cases is in the dark
my partner and I complained about this 10 min visit. seen the dark places
it's not worth 1 euro we paid 7 euros",1
Perhaps disappointed in expectations,"We honestly thought the exhibition would be more engaging. To get in we had to go through a thousand checks, ... but that's okay. Very few people present.",2
What a disappointment...,"Rich and quite interesting collection. However, from a museological point of view, the exhibition leaves something to be desired: an environment that is too (too, I repeat) dark to be able to observe some of the pieces in detail (the visitor is very far away from them and there is no magnification), glasses that are not adjusted for the purpose (a lot of reflection, which makes it difficult to correctly visualize the pieces found on lower levels), the background where the jewels are placed does not allow for a careful observation of the exhibition (in dark, choppy wood), a very cluttered arrangement of the collection, replicas placed without any criteria, very small and confusing captions... Having some knowledge of museology, I can say that this museum is the perfect example of what should not be done. Furthermore (family of four), we paid more than €30, which is too high considering the purchasing power of most Portuguese people. Completely disappointed.",2
Disappointment,"The museum is interesting and well maintained
despite being a short visit for the price charged. The security check at the entrance is completely inadequate and completely ruined the visit. It is carried out by 2 inexperienced people who pass personal objects through screening n times as they do not understand what they are seeing. They ask to take cell phones, watches, keys, cosmetics (lipsticks and creams), liquids, everything from their pockets, coats... in front of us was a couple with a baby who had to test the entire range of baby creams on themselves and force the baby to drinking water in addition to passing their bags through the device several times asking each other what they were seeing on the screen. No words for the tremendous incompetence. Shameful",2
"I hope you improve the way you display your beautiful pieces, even if only a few pieces","Not very interesting, little content and very dark and not coherent exposition, some pieces had a number to identify others not.",2
Skip it,"Staff extremely rude. I was questioned about every item in my purse - from a metal pen I have (which I’ve never had any questions about) to my hand sanitizer. But even worse, my friend who has had two hip replacements was taken to a separate room and asked to pull down her trousers so they could ensure she was not smuggling anything in. It was absurd. They think that a stern and annoyed visage equals being a professional - it does not. Yes, I’ve been to the Tower of London where security is professional and the jewels more spectacular. This exhibit was nice but pricy ticket. Extremely low lighting. The descriptions of most of the items was minimal and there was very little historical context. Traffic was awful getting there from Baxia. Unless your love of jewels and silver out weighs being treated like a potential criminal - skip this.",2
Há melhores museus em Lisboa,"Caro e não vale muito a pena. Concordo com a crítica anterior, a catalogação das peças é confusa, para tão grande investimento não se entende que essa parte tenha sido descurada.",1
Um excelente exemplo de como NÃO devem ser expostas peças de joalharia !,"Bom acervo de joias reais relativamente recentes (o possível e que sobreviveu à História e à dissipação das peças ao longo do tempo).

Contudo, neste museu temos um excelente exemplo de como peças de joalharia não devem ser expostas!
- Não existe qualquer numeração que faça corresponder as peças com a sua legenda (descrição), o que torna muito difícil a sua compreensão;
- As legendas com a descrição das peças estão escritas com letra extremamente pequena, praticamente impossível de ler sem recurso a uma lupa;
- Além de não se conseguirem ler bem, as legendas estão mal colocadas, algumas vezes a cerca de 40cm do chão apenas! Para as ler, é preciso andar curvado ou de ""gatas""!;
- A maioria das peças encontra-se exposta em placas de acrílico (ou vidro) preto, cujo brilho e reflexo interfere com o brilho das peças, dificultando o seu conveniente visionamento e apreciação;
- As vitrines que protegem as peças também não são de vidro anti-reflexo, o que difuculta também o conveniente visionamento das peças exspostas. O reflexo dos vidros das vitrines aliado ao reflexo das placas onde se encontram as peças impedem o conveniente visionamento das mesmas;
- A iluminação das peças é de fraquíssima qualidade, o que dificulta também o seu visionamento;
- Além disso, a imuminação das peças reflete-se ns placas de acrílico (ou vidro) preto em que as peças estão expostas, impedindo o seu conveniente visionamento;
- As peças estão colocadas muito em cima uma das outras o que não facilita a sua apreciação;
- A sinalética, indicando o percurso a fazer, é praticamente inexistente e muito deficiente;
- As legendas disponíveis têm alguns (poucos) erros;
- Falta alguma literatura que descreva as peças expostas e que faça o seu enquadramento histórico convenientemente.

Não era sequer necessário que quem expôs as peças desta forna inaceitável saísse do país para ver como se devem expor peças de joalharia. Bastava visitar o Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, em Lisboa!",2
Commercial street to avoid,"This street could have been highlighted by the authorities with a nice view of the Arco de Triunfo. It's not so. Shops catch tourists, bars and restaurants of very poor quality at exorbitant prices and beggars. The whole panoply of a street to avoid at all costs.",2
Skip this one! Loudest hotel ever,"You may have seen on their website that they claim to be soundproof. Throw that out the window. This is by far the loudest hotel I've ever been in.
You can hear external street noise (You're right next to the famous arch in Portugal so there's lots of street performers) but also the hotel itself is very loud. There's constant door alarms going off, door slamming, and we woke up to a bunch of drilling. The rooms are very small and the hotel doesn't have any amenities",2
Unpleasant,"Street full of tourist traps of all kinds (restaurants, bars, souvenir shops made in China), beggars, street vendors, drug sellers and other touts. Too bad, this street offers a beautiful perspective on the arch, but the surrounding fauna makes wandering unpleasant.",2
Go your way,"Street vendors, touts, beggars, scams, exorbitant prices, drugs, cripples... what more can I say. Go your way.",1
Go your way,"Avoid, not amazing.
Not much to see other than the main square and the arch. Lots of scams and restaurants trying to get you to come and rip you off",2
An unmissable street and yet… it’s becoming catastrophic,"A must-see street in Lisbon to observe the arch of Praça do Comércio, one of the best known in Lisbon and yet...
Restaurants are tourist traps, don’t go there.
Lots of street vendors who come to approach you.
Be careful of the parallel streets at night.. very poorly frequented... watch your belongings!",2
Disappointment,"The Portuguese are not as welcoming as I thought
If they want tourists to come or return, they need to stop raising prices and be more welcoming.",2
Van eten tot aan cannabis,"Leuke drukke winkelstraat waarin ook de nodige en restaurants zitten.
En waar je veel, heel veel aangesproken wordt door lui die je verdovende middelen willen verkopen. Van cannabis tot cocaïne..je kunt het er allemaal kopen.
Dat doet echt afbreuk aan de omgeving waarin je bent.
Vandaar de twee sterren.",2
Cuidado com quem fica na rua oferecendo opção para comer,"A rua em si é bem diversificada e movimentada, porém a nota ruim foi para alertar as pessoas que ficam te ""pescando"" nas esquinas oferecendo pratos com preços mais atrativos. No final, cobram um caixinha generoso e ainda querem o pagamento em dinheiro. Evite isso. Pergunte antes de entrar no estabelecimento (alguns nem tem nome na frente) e pergunte tudo que será cobrada para evitar aborrecimentos.",1
Booking in advance is pointless and annoying,"I actually would recommend this place, which I've visited several times, but the reason for the low stars is because they've introduced a ridiculous booking system where you can't just turn up and buy a ticket - as you could for years in the past - but have to book in advance. This is adding a layer of totally unnecessary complication and for people visiting from cruise ships, it's impossible. They need to go back to their original booking system of buying tickets on the door. Stop making things difficult.",2
Never Opened or Got In,I waited outside the site for it to open for 15 minutes and it never did. The door was locked but you could see staff inside. Either they did not open for the day or I needed to book well in advance. Still it seemed no one booked in advance for that time either since I was the only one waiting outside. Nowhere was anything explained and no one bothered to talk to me about how to get in. Very disappointing and unorganized way to run a site. Would not recommend.,1
Bad experience due to reckless and rude people,"The worst boat tour I've done in my life, a boat without closed cabins and cold that got everywhere (4 of us got bronchitis) and without an audio guide to explain what we were seeing and without even anyone on the boat to do it. Horrible........not recommended",1
Disappointing,"First they tried to cancel it when they reached the meeting point or suggested we join the tour in English, because it was just us. There is no indication that the implementation of the activity depends on the number of people who sign up. Finally we were 6 and made the tour. The slightly chaotic guide gave us brush strokes of things but without order or context. He mixed themes and we didn’t see all the ones indicated in the description of the activity. He recognized that he hadn’t done a tour for months....",2
MINIMUM TIP,"We tour with a Guide, Antonio of Spain. The explanations and the tour was fine. The problem came when he asked us for the tip for his work done at the end of the tour , we gave him 18 € and in front of the rest of participants he was outraged and made the derogatory comment that my family's tour was paying for him.
I don’t know the deals you have with the company that hired the free service and that is stated in the invoice without contracted charge.
According to the Antonio Guide we had to give him a minimum of €40, why is that usually given.
If you had informed us before starting the tour about this forced tip we probably would not have gone.
The Pro part of his job was left under the shadow of his lack of education.",1
I will not repeat with this company,"We did the visit with Cecilia and she left a lot to be desired and a lot to forget too, since her attitude was unprofessional at several times.",1
A real shame,"The guide Cecilia knew about history, but she was rude and talked about money all the time, not at all empathetic. I haven't learned anything from Lisbon, except his opinion about not visiting St. George's Castle and that it had saved us money. Very bad experience",1
Primera decepción con los free tours de Sandeman,"Primera decepción que tengo con Sandeman. No me gustó, me pareció una pérdida de tiempo y no me aportó nada. No recomendaría hacerlo con el guía que nos tocó de nombre Vlado.",2
History lecture,I did the free walking tour with Jaime and initially it started well with a few key landmarks and interesting facts about Lisbon. As the tour carried on it become more of a history lecture on Portuguese invasion. Although informative the majority of people are here to find out about the local landmarks and any useful tips. Not a fun tour and it overan by 30mins !!!,1
Unprofessional behavior and poor customer treatment,"I experienced a disturbing situation in the face of this salon. After a previous treatment that did not give the desired effect, courteous and objective feedback was given shortly afterwards. The response from the therapist was that the effect could last several months. It was therefore expected in good faith, but unfortunately without any noticeable improvement.

Upon later contact to discuss a new treatment, as well as obtaining a professional assessment of why previous treatment did not work, I was met with aggressiveness and full rejection. Not only was the feedback ignored, but further treatment was also denied – even by wanting to pay for a new hour. This appears to be unprofessional and very customer-friendly.

Based on this experience, it is recommended to assess other, more professional players who meet customers with respect and openness. Listening to the customer is a basic prerequisite in any serious treatment service.",1
Recommended noise-cancelling headphones,"The boat is very good.
The view of Lisbon at sunset too.
However, there is not enough table outside for everyone.

And the music has a dangerously high sound level. Even painful.

Service at the middle bar. Waiters who openly mock certain tourists
Too bad!",1
Boat is unsafe and bar tenders are not respectful,"Boat is unsafe and bar tenders are irrespectful

Security issues: the loud speaker is not attached can fall over you if you try to hang on to it when the boat is unstable

Irrespect from batmen: the sound of the music is far far too loud. You can Become deft. If you ask them to reduce they will laugh at you. They will not reduce the volume. And they look at you as if tou are crazy

Never come here.",1
Misadventure,Very disappointed.. catamaran cancelled the same morning. I was offered a similar service on a boat that had nothing and cost much less... And to compensate for the Award difference (no refund of differences) .I am told it will be open bar... Actually open bar on softs .. not even a cocktail offered... It really wasn't worth the Award Difference. Luckily the view was top..,1
The tour was canceled without prior notice,"There was no tour, it was canceled without prior notice, we arrived at the place and everything was closed. Until now, without knowing what happened, it was paid on the card, without knowing how to go about requesting a refund. Bad experience!!!",1
"""Special boat"" - premium boat","The experience was the worst I have,
I bought the ticket for special boat, that was what they said, and they present me a small catamaran with very bad conditions.
I don't recommended this trip.
It's my second time in Portugal and I recommend others companies to do this trip.",1
Not What We Booked,"While in Lisbon we booked a TukTuk of the old city. The individual we booked with said he would give us a 1 hour tour for 100 Euros. He met us at the specified time which was 6:30pm. After we got in he told us that it was a holiday (Corpus Kristie) and part of the tour was closed until 7:00 pm. That should have been my first red flag. For someone who provides tour should have known this and said we could have booked for 7:00. Instead he convinced us to take a different tour for $150 Euros. Said it was a much better. Well we seen 3 monuments. While our guide was extremely knowledgeable I believe he basically scammed us as there is no way that tour should have cost that amount. He then tried to convince us to take the old city tour the next. I was like Nope! Fool me once my bad as I will not
Be fooled a second time.
If you plan a TukTuk tour while in Lisbon do your REAEARCH!",2
Not Worth The Money,We were supposed to have a tour of the old city for an hour at 100 Euros. When we met our driver we were told that it was a holiday and a portion of the tour are was closed until 7:00pm and we could not access. We should have been told this when we booked. So he talked us into a different tour that was supposed to be better that would last 1.5 hours at a cost of 150 Euros. Since we had booked we felt obligated and it sounded good. While our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable we only went to 3 monuments. In our opinion we were scammed. Do your research before taking a Turk Tuk tours. This was our bad as we should have checked for reviews which we could not find. This had to be the most unpleasant of our 17 day Mediterranean vacation.,2
"No visit due to Sintra sites constraints, no answer, no refund","Sintra sites were closed due to potential fire risk, all the tickets were refunded by the vendors, Scotturb is the only that neither answer to the refund request nor refunded tickets. Any further comment, terrible customer service. Not recommended at all.",1
Terrible experience – dishonest pricing and overcrowded buses,"I took a Scotturb bus in Portugal and was extremely disappointed. The driver refused to sell the regular €4 ticket, insisting that I buy the 24h pass for €13.50. On their own website, this pass is listed at €12, but the price on the bus is made to look like a discount (they cross out €18 to make it seem like a deal — it’s not).

To make things worse, the bus was completely packed, with people standing shoulder to shoulder for the entire ride. No comfort, no space, no respect for the advertised service.

A tourist trap on wheels. Avoid if you can — especially if you expect fair pricing and basic travel conditions.",1
Unique and expensive offer,"Going to Sintra know that you are captive! 1 fare now (13,5 € for unlimited 24 hours) but in itself, who makes the bus for 24 hours? We're all here to visit Pena. Unpleasant reception of controllers who placed themselves on the defensive immediately. All sheep!",1
"Rather, if you can, go on foot","One of the worst services I have ever used (so to speak) during a holiday.
The ticket office automatically issued the €13.50 24h fare, without informing anyone of the possibility of making the single ticket.
The buses follow two different circuits dedicated to the two main attractions, so you can not go directly from one to the other (Palazzo de Pena and Quinta da Regaleira), but you should return to the base and take the other bus, wasting a lot of time and hoping that the bus will pass.
So a lot of us did it on foot.
In the early afternoon, after waiting in vain for 3 routes marked on the timetable, I ask for information and find that for that day the bus has stopped running.
Bottom line: I took advantage of only one ride for the ""modest amount"" of € 13,50!!!",1
DO NOT BUY.,"The buses will not run if the parks are closed, we made it to Sintra in the morning, parks were closed due to overnight rain; there are no refunds. DO NOT BUY",1
Do not buy in advance,"On March 13th, I bought two transport combos and tickets to the storehouse. They just didn't send me the tickets from the ranch. I called, advertised on the website, on Instagram, but it was not resolved. Don't buy. I bought in advance to enjoy my trip to Europe peacefully. But unfortunately because of this company I have to stay every day trying to solve without success. Absurd. Terrible disrespect to the consumer",1
DO NOT USE!!!,"We bought tickets at the office. Caught the bus and got off at the first stop. We visited the castle & went back to the bus stop. Waited one and a half hours, no bus!!! Lovely Tuk tuk driver eventually took pity on us and drove us back to the train station, we’d wasted our day! Do not touch this company!",1
Avoid private alternatives,"A disastrous experiment. Frequency was not respected at all. Endless wait of over an hour. Driver pretending not to understand...
Avoid this service and even if it is more expensive, take a touk touk or use cars that offer the same service at the same price as a bus trip.",1
Onibus does not come every 5 min,"The buses don't go every 5 minutes, I'm more than 30 minutes in the rain and there's no bus coming.
Very bad experience, terrible!!!",1
Disappointing Experience in a Beautiful City,"I had high hopes for my visit to this stunning city, but unfortunately, my experience was marred by terrible transportation services. The drivers were rude and unhelpful, providing little to no assistance when we needed information.

To make matters worse, we purchased tickets to visit the palaces, only to find out that they were on strike that day. The staff sold us the tickets without informing us of this issue, which felt deceptive and dishonest.

I would advise others to be cautious when using this transportation service, as it seems to operate unethically. It's a shame that such a beautiful city is marred by such poor service",1
Just use local transportation,"The 434 bus was fine, but only used it once. I did see quite a few of them. The 435 bus was near impossible to find. Waited about 25 minutes for it to show up. When it did, and after the people had exited the bus, an elderly man started getting on, at which point the driver shut the door on him, literally hitting the gentleman in the body and forcing him backwards. The driver then, without any interaction with the crowd waiting, got out of the bus and walked over to a group of other drivers and proceeded to have a conversation for about 10 minutes. Upon returning to the bus, he was unfriendly and unhelpful while he boarded the bus. He then proceeded to sit on the bus for another 5 minutes while he texted on his phone. We did get to our destination. Unfortunately, from that destination we simply could not find another 435 bus to continue our journey, and had to use a bolt. After completing that destination, we noticed the sign at the attraction informing us that the 435 was no longer in service to pick up from that location. This information would have been nice to know when we bought the tickets. So, again, had to use a bolt to get back to the train. All in all, for a 24-hour pass, we were only able to use the bus two times. I would not buy this ticket again and it would simply use the local transportation.",1
Combo ticket scam ‼️,"We bought a combo ticket online for a 24-hour hop-on, hop-off bus and entrance to Pena Palace. At first, everything seemed fine, but when we arrived at the palace, the staff wouldn’t let us in with those tickets. The tickets were sent as QR codes instead of barcodes, so security couldn’t scan them. Fortunately, there were still time slots available for the same day, so we were able to see the palace. However, we haven't received any response from the ScottURB team, not even saying about a partial refund…",1
Horrible!!!!!,"Bad, more than 1 hour waiting, bus 20 min to fill that not a can of tuna, bad service, bad price,
Horrible unthinkable an experience like this, I never imagined anything so bad",1
Horror!!! Terrible!!!,"Horror!!! Terrible!!! Horrible !! DO NOT GO!!
Bad experience long waiting , half an hour to fill the bus that not even a can of sardines !
Terrible, the worst experience worthy of a Steven King League",1
Ticket sellers are liars and lack any quality of usefulness.,Employees selling tickets lie through the teeth. They try to make you pay for the full day pass which is 4x the price of a normal bus ticket. The bus driver for the 434 line is in beds with the ticket sellers and just doesn’t do jack when asked a question. If anything just pay a fee with the individual taxi drivers cause it is still cheaper than the day pass.,1
Appalling,"Appalling service. Overcrowded buses.
Fictitious schedule. No bus for an hour then 3 show up.Complete waste of money. Simply not possible to hop on hop off. More like a hop on - rip off.",1
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH SAVE YOUR MONEY USE UBER,"Well what can I say, I read a few reviews here and thought they can’t be that bad. How wrong I was. Absolute garbage apart from the odd decent driver. Don’t expect the 435 service to start until 10am from Sintra station. When you do get a bus like the 434 they are rammed full and you’ll be standing, unless it’s the smaller 435 where it is ‘illegal’ to stand 🤔 the services are few and far between, one bus drove past us empty and the driver just looked at us 😡 had an argument with the 435 driver because we’d been waiting for ages and he wouldn’t let us stand on the smaller bus but it’s ok on the big ones. Save your money use UBER, it’s efficient and you know when and where they will come. Don’t pay the 13 euros for the day pass you’ll use about two buses. Hopeless in every way, I really can’t stress how poor this service is, DONT BUY THEIR TICKETS YOU'LL REGRET IT.",1
"Way too busy, Sintra completely overflowing, traffic infarction","I arrived in Sintra by train from Lisbon. There was immediately a promotion team for the hop on hop off buses 434 and 435. But even though all alarms should have gone red (too many people, no coach but regular bus, completely flooded town, already stuck in traffic right after the station), I still fell for it. They offer a hop-on hop-off service, but since I was already 45 min on my way to the Pena castle in the morning and wanted to leave by 14:15 and had to wait 30 min for another bus and was only in Sintra city at 15:00, there is little interest left to get on again. There were so many people at the bus stop when I left Sintra that I just walked back to the train station.
I read somewhere that in the past there were 12000 visitors a day to the Pena castle, that is equivalent to 200 buses with 60 people, maybe even more. I would rather choose a tuk tuk oid next time, they drive around enough and are faster and more flexible.",1
Fraude,"1
Do not buy!!
They're doing a terrible service! Fraude

On 15/09/2024, all the monuments of Sintra were closed until 17/09 due to the risks of fire. The company also did not make the Trips by bus and I had bought the ticket over the internet! They refused to make the refund!
Absurd!!!",1
Ride faul,"Absolute Trash, waited 30 minutes without a Bus comming. WhatsApp contact cant speak english. Do yourself a favor and skip this. Just use bolt or Uber to get to the castles",1
DISGUSTING,"That sucks! Disorganized, unable to provide decent service, lines jumping all the time, 2 hours waiting for nothing. AVOID",1
Horrible experience worst service,"I don’t even know where to start, whether criticizing the poor condition of the buses or even worse customer service.

Buses as they sell them have 24h service and stop at the places of interest indicated on the map. Lie, the service ends at 18:30 and all they do is take a useless tour of Sintra, which with luck after more than 50 minutes and being locked up without air conditioning in the middle of August, takes you to the Castle of Pena. Sorry, I'm talking plural buses, when there's only one.

The driver could not be in the least interested in the stops he must respect, because in this experience even pressing the ‘stop’ button until we let him know that the bus stopped, he did not open the doors. Of course, I picked up people in lots that didn't fit in the vehicle because I guess money moves more than integrity.

Finally, of course we claim, which could not give more equal to the customer service since everything had an explanation and is that in the end it will be our fault that this service takes more than one negative reaction. Nothing to do with what they sell.",1
Don’t take these buses,"The drivers are rude. Take a tuk-tuk. It's the best way to manage your time and money. The buses take too long to arrive and are a big waste of money for what they offer. Take whatever you want, just not these buses, you will regret it.",1
Scam,"The other comments describe well
Take the tac at 20 euros (you can negotiate at 10 or 15) the same price as the bus and you will arrive at your destination",1
Misleading advertising,"It's supposed that line 434 ends at 7:00, with passes of 5 in 5', but that's not true. I waited at the stop next to the train station between 17:00 and 18:00, having stopped eight buses whose drivers informed me that they would be out of service. I moved to the services where they tried to convince me that at 17:25 a bus would have started the tour. If so, the driver lied to me because I questioned everyone who passed the mentioned stop.",1
Pessimo servizio costosissimo!,I do not recommend these means. Overpriced ticket(€13.50) to transport you from the station to the palaces! The town is tiny and there are Ubers and bolts much cheaper! Rude drivers on some rides. I absolutely advise against it. You can make a simple one-way ticket but as soon as you leave the station they block you and tell you there is only that chance. Ma non è così! Sintra is one of the richest cities in Portugal thanks to the pockets of poor tourists!! Una vergogna! Avoid it,1
"Sintra lovely, Scott Urb less so - explore other options for getting around","after experiencing excellent public transport in Lisbon and the train to Sintra, I expected similar in Sintra. this was not the case. Booked Scott Urb Hop on , Hop off through expedia, and it was over crowded from the start. The services are massively over subscribed. Luckily it wasn't raining for us, but still had to wait a while for the bus, only for the driver to refuse us because he was already full. They need to sell less tickets and improve the service, not just keep selling capacity they are already well over.

Based on above, I would investigate other options, as the stress did ruin the experience.",1
Anscam,"A word of advice, take a single ticket for 5 euros to go up to the Pena Palace and go back down on foot… we paid 27 euros for two for an unlimited service and we could only take one bus because the 435 does not had only one vehicle and only passed every 40 minutes, we ended up walking because it was quicker. Avoid, catch tourists and everyone falls in, it's cheaper to take taxis if you don't want to walk there...",1
Terrible,"Terrible, some tourists do not respect arrival order and cut line. Had to wait a lot, bus driver did not care to put order in the li ne",1
Don't use this bus,"Too bad, there are no buses they say they have, it takes more than an hour and is always full. It didn't stop for tourists at Quinta da Regaleira. Badly educated. Don't buy this ticket, use
Bolt or public bus.",1
WASTE OF TIME. DO NOT BOOK,"Give this a miss - Hop on hop off, more hop on and stand an wait …… it took over 40 minutes to get from Sintra Station to Pena Palace on a crowded bus that didn’t leave at advertised time until it was crammed full. In fact it took so long to do one circular tour (434) - we never even had time to do the other (435)
Better off finding another way or just paying a single fare. WASTE OF TIME",1
"Crappy service, cash grab, avoid at all costs","If I could also give this a zero I would. All the previous reviews are correct in this being a tourist trap and crappy service. We ended up walking between at least 2 sites as 434 buses were constantly full. The bus schedule was not at all accurate, with us having to wait sometimes 30-40 min per bus.
The 435 line bus is basically the hunger games on wheels. It only seats 19, there was no bus rep so people just pushed and shoved to get on. Avoid!!! Avoid!!! AVOID!!!",1
I would look for another transport option,"Positive: polite drivers who showed care for passengers
As well as the ticket sales team, right outside the train station

Negatives:
-the value of 13.50 is too expensive, for lines 434 and 435, for the service delivered
-the map is wrong, with line 435 not passing by Palacio Nacional de Sintra (the map is out of date at all bus stops). The driver himself informed that the bus no longer makes this stop as a road is closed.
-line 435 has a very long interval, 30 minutes, while line 434 takes 5/5 minutes
-a bus that was on line 435, had a 434 sticker, as I just looked at the side I missed this bus and had to wait 30 minutes

The idea of the service is very good, they just need to prioritize customers and rethink effective and correct communication for them",2
The worst transport experience,"The worst transport experience I ever had. Overpriced tickets with almost no options except 24h ticket for 13,5 Euro. If you don't need the day ticket, I think using a taxi is more convenient. By the bus 434 you can get to Pena and it is possible to buy one way tickets for 4.55 Euro from a driver, but you should repeat to the driver twice, because he is trying to sold you the day ticket. By the bus 435 they can't one way or return ticket, although on the site they mentioned about direct and return ticket for bus 435 for 6 euro, but don't provide it neither at office nor from the driver. It is cheaper to use public transport (for example 1253) with Zapping and make round trips, including Cabo de Roca.",1
Big scam,"13 euros 50 per person. The first bus (taken from the station) took us to the first stop. We then spent our time waiting for buses which did not pass, or did not stop because they were too busy. We had to do everything else on foot with the children on our backs. There were a lot of us tourists in this situation... to flee!",1
Transport scam in Sintra,"A service of two buses offering tours to the sites to visit in Sintra, for 13€50 per person, to get off and back on wherever and whenever you want. In fact, it's a great scam, we wait for the buses for more than 3/4 of an hour, then we leave on foot... Extremely lousy service!!!",1
Would 100% Avoid,"Waited at a bus stop for 40 minutes only to finally see our bus drive by without stopping. Signage showed we were in the right place, and the staff at the visitor center confirmed it. Ended up paying 9 Euros to an Uber to get us to the castle we had tickets for. When that castle closed we walked to the bus stop at 6pm since the brochure said the last bus runs at 6:30…looked at the sign there and if says the last pick up there is 5:15. That was not stated anywhere else, no times were given previously or other stops. Hopped on a random bus since we didn’t have phone service to find another option, so we then spent an hour on a bus getting motion sick as we had to go out of the way 45 minutes. So disappointed we went this route and weren’t served as promised.",1
Not worth is if you want info about the city,"Though it is labelled as a hop on hop off, the bus is merely a fast shuttle that gets you quickly to various places to visit sites you should have researched before since there is absolutely no commentary of any kind. A better option is to book tuktuk or other small vehicle tours since they are more capable of getting you to places and answer questions...they can also park pretty much anywhere in those narrow streets.",2
Tourist trap,"Very efficient ticket sales at the station. This is where the advantages of service end. no timetable information at stops. The lines towards Pena Castle (734) serve larger buses, so there is no problem with getting there, but the 735 lines serve small buses and it is not possible to board at the stops near the castles. Buses run very rarely, so even if you have a ticket, you may have to use an Uber or a tuk tuk.",1
They rob you on line 434 to Castillo da Pena,"Disastrous experience on the Pena Palace bus line 434, they have deceived us in our face with the tickets, the bus driver, I asked him for 4 round trip tickets to the palace and he sold me 4 24 hour passes, the difference The thing is that a single ticket is €4.10, there is no round trip ticket. They sell you a 24-hour pass that costs €13.50 without informing you, you realize it inside the bus, you inform the driver of the error and it doesn't matter, they do nothing to solve it, they lie to your face saying that they informed you, they send you to the bus office. company at the train station, when you go to the office they tell you with all their might that a round trip ticket is a 24 hour pass, I answer that if they think we are stupid, if they don't exist they don't exist, but fool the people with another product, I have come to think that the driver works on commission of the deceptions they make. A very unfortunate experience that ruins your day, not because of the €22 they steal from you, but because of the way they laugh in your face and the helplessness it generates in you.",1
Worst experience I had in Sintra,"Worst experience I've had. Very expensive, Rude, rude and without any training. I don't recommend it to anyone.
I recommend other transport options",1
Tourist trap and employees peddle tickets.,"This is a tourist trap.
As soon as u get off the train they r located outside the train station. Withh all the confusion and people u think u need to get on the bus but you don't .

Walk a block away and you will find public transport.

The employees are rude just peddling tickets.

Expensive and a tourist trap. No set time. Green route does not run all the time.",1
"abuse,","abuse....., yes more
On their website they indicate that there is a fee of 7.60 Euros to go and return to Palacio da Pena. We get to the bus and it tells us the rate is 13.50 per person (there are 4 of us), for the complete tour but 7 euros just to go to Castelo de Pena. I insist that I want the rate of 7.6 for going and returning, and he tells me that this rate is only for groups of more than 25 people (which he was not going to give me), that either we pay 13.5 for the tour or I stayed on the ground. We were afraid of not getting there because of the famous traffic jams that there are, in the end a robbery of 54 euros, standing, with a milk jam and the feeling that we were being kidded. I went to the palace, it's sad, and to the quinta da regadeira, now I think the best option is, Uber, tuk tuk, or cars with drivers, 20 or 25 euros per trip, you can get it, that's if no one can take it away from the traffic jam. One to go up to the Da Pena Palace and the other to go from there to Quinta da Regadeira, from there you walk back to the National Palaces (almost flat and 10 minutes), 5 minutes to the train station and 10 minutes to any parking lot you took in Sintra.",1
Expensive and bad,"Bus packed, it took us 50 minutes to make the trip, we almost lost the tickets to the Pena Palace, everything has been complaints, VERY EXPENSIVE, in the end we did not make transfers so as not to waste time on the road. It's not worth it, better to take private transportation.",1
Tourist trap,"Tourist trap, low frequency, no fixed schedule. You are better served on other transport services. Note that there are 3 bus companies offering similar services. Count on low frequency and no fixed schedule to get you organised and catch the next bus.

Some casteles are just a few min walk from eachother. For the longer distances, boog a private casr and share costs with fellow visitors. You'll get better service and be cheaper off.",1
Shameful and awful,"Absolutely avoid.
The most beautiful scam I have encountered despite my numerous trips around the world.
How can a town hall allow such a situation to persist, giving such a bad image to its city and its country?
Unless she too is part of this disastrous organization that is ruining your day.",1
Everything is bad,"If I could give a rating below zero, I would give it that. Very bad.
Everything is bad.
As for tickets, the only ones that we were told could be purchased were those for 12.50 which include the 434 and 435 route (otherwise around 4 euros for one stage, around 7 euros for the return trip). The 434 stops at Castello dos muros, Palacio de la Pena and the historic centre, the 435 makes another tour which includes Quinta de Regaleira (Quinta Regaleira can easily be reached on foot in 10 minutes from the historic centre; Palacio de La Pena can be reached in walk from Castello dos muros, but it is slightly uphill).
The 435 is a legend: everyone has heard of it, no one has ever seen it! The worst thing was turning to assistance, a grumpy girl who spoke to us in English and Portuguese to her colleague thinking she wasn't understood, and to the complaints about the fact that we had bought 25 euros worth of tickets but had only used them once once because the bus hadn't passed, he replied ""you made the wrong stop"".
Now, although I'm a foreign country, as far as possible, don't understand everything 100%, but if you allow me, ""at least"" I can read the numbers!
Highly not recommended!",1
Very bad experience,"Bad experience with buses that don't run as per the indicated time, the 435 line which should take a different route from the 434 and allow you to see attractions not covered by the 434 route is completely non-existent with people, even elderly people, waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes then forced to go on foot. I highly recommend the single route to the Moorish castle and then walking to the Pena palace (the distance is short although with a difference in altitude) and then moving from Pena to the historic center from where it is possible to go on foot (about 7/8 minutes) to the Regaleira (worth the visit) then from here consider whether to take another bus or go on foot (about 7/8 minutes); alternatively there are private tours for 10 euros or taxi-type tours for 5 euros each way. I highly recommend this last option, perhaps slightly more expensive (2.50 euros total in my case) but which saves you from wasting a long time waiting for these ghost buses. PS: while I was at the stop several people tried to contact the number indicated on the tables which was disconnected and I went to their office in front of the station without receiving any assistance (I also missed the scheduled train due to this delay and was forced to wait for a another hour).",1
Awful experience - wish I could give them a zero,"This group is immediately on the left when you come out of train station. (Everyone seemed to be going this way). Wish we had known to go right to public buses.

Staff was rude. Explained nothing, except that you could pay for an all day ticket right there in line. No options. It was way too expensive for the one trip we wanted, but we did it. They packed people on the bus like sardines….many standing. It took us a miserable hour to get up to the Peña Palace. No information about what we were passing.

When we finished with the Peña Palace we came back out to look for one of these buses. Nothing! Finally took a public bus (434, I think) back to the train station.

What a ripoff!",1
Terrible service,Terrible! They don’t show up timely and the bus is too full for everyone to get on when they do. Do not use.,1
Very badly.,"Slow and expensive. Since there is no other option, they do what they want.

A 15 minute trip takes more than 1 hour. And we lose the entrances to the palace.

0 information",1
Beware of scammers,"They shamelessly exploit their monopoly position. There are two ""pimps"" standing in front of the bus at the station who lie like crazy. Apparently there is only the €15 ticket. The single trip for €4.10 or the return trip for €7.60 is apparently only available for groups of 45 people or more. Literally: ""Are you 45 people?"" Then the single ticket supposedly costs €10. After 5 minutes of discussion I finally got the ticket for €4.10 and was even able to pay with a credit card.
These scammers should be put to a stop. I will complain to the tourist board.
If something similar happens to you, please complain officially.",1
Don't ride this bus. Waste of money.,"Bus, when or if it shows up, was always full. Rode it exactly twice before giving up and just walking.
Do yourself a favor, skip Pena (its way too crowded) and take a tuck tuck to the Moorish castle then walk downhill to historic Sinatra. Had a nice meal there and enjoyed shopping.",1
No kindness,"A most unpleasant welcome, no friendliness due to the language barrier.
She absolutely wanted to sell us the ticket for 24 hours, even though we wanted a simple round trip to the Peña Palace.",1
Do not use this company!!!,"The company that carried out the transport previously charged around 2.5 euros. This company is offering the tour for 12.5 euros in a bus without air conditioning. All the passengers, including elderly people, felt sick due to the temperature of this garbage bus. It's better to go there and back by Uber or Tuktuk, paying 20 to 30 euros, than using this pathetic company.
Driver was extremely rude and rude and drove without any care.
Anyway, don't spend 1 cent with this company.",1
SCAM ALERT!!! You will not get anything but ripped off.,"This outfit is pure SCAM. I wasted 22 Eu on a fraud. Please stay away. I will contest w credit card and report to tourist police. They have one miserable bus that will not be there. It runs every hour, but I never saw it after ride up. Pay less and get the regular tourist bus, runs every 15 min. Or take a cab, or call a Uber or anything but these clowns. There is some inane narration that works at some seats. The bus driver is no help at all and super grumpy. They sell hard, tell you it’s a great idea and you will be out of your money fast and WILL have to look for plan B rides. I ended up walking mostly and paying for my tickets w another bus. It’s a rip off. Don’t even think about it! I wish I had known. Feel so stupid wasting my money.",1
Do not us! Get an uber / tuk tuk/ anything else,Absolute rip off - can’t hop on hop off as they are full!! 12.5 euros each? It’s 5 euros for an Uber down from castle. And - Peña castle - interesting from outside but inside is a stately home you shuffle through in a constant queue of people. Underwhelmed,1
Bad choice. You buy it and can't use it.,"We bought it, paid 66 euros for 3 adults and we were very angry because at the exit of Palácio Pena (1st point we visited) we waited for 65 minutes and the bus DID NOT ARRIVE. We had to pay +8 euros to go from the Palace to the center of the historic town.
THE SERVICE does not work because the traffic in Sintra is a mess. Chaotic and has zero supervision. Tuktuks are very popular, they stop anywhere and exploit tourists without mercy. Other than that, there are carriages, taxis, regular buses, several tourist buses, Ubers, private cars providing illegal transport. In short, a real mess that makes the visit a hassle. A shame because the place is beautiful, but impossible to recommend.",1
Seriously incorrect behavior,"Once we arrived in Sintra, we tried to buy the €7.60 tickets (return to the Pena palace) but the ticket sellers refused, saying that they could only sell the €12.50 ones. I went to their office and threatened to call the police, they issued tickets. It really seems like a serious impropriety that perhaps the local authorities should check.",1
DO NOT BUY TICKETS!!!,"Do not buy tickets for this bus. Bus timetables states 20 minutes, but in reality it takes over an hour for pick up. When they do show up, buses are too small and full to pick anybody up.",1
Round trip ticket. No tour 12'50.,"BE ATTENTIVE!!!!
They sell you the tour for €12.50 to get on and off the bus as many times as you want.
The normal thing is that you go up and down one. They have a ticket for €7.60 round trip to Da Pena.
The sellers will charge you directly for €12.50. You have to tell him that you only want the other.",1
Scam and assault,"The experience with this transport company has been terrible. In short, a consumer scam with false information on the web, terrible and dangerous transport conditions for the client, impossible waiting times to access tourist attractions, and finally a cocky, threatening attitude that ends in attacks on their own clients. . INTOLERABLE.

We start with the purchase of the tickets, they do not give the possibility of buying the simplest tickets of a trip, but rather they force the purchase of the full-day ticket, this being 3 times the value of the single trip. The information offered on the website is not real.

After purchasing the tickets, we found a climb to the palace worth more than 1 hour, which made it impossible for us to buy tickets to the palace for that day. In their pamphlet it is supposed that the bus takes 15 minutes to get to the palace stop.
Once we decided to go down, to try to see other attractions, the waiting time for the arrival of the bus exceeded an hour, when they themselves in emails after the complaint indicated that the times are usually 30 minutes even if they are not done traffic charge in the area.

Once on the buses, conditions do not improve. Lack of air conditioning in the middle of summer, full buses with no space to move or get off at stops. One of the buses was rubbing the bottom of the car against the ground due to the weight it was carrying. The truth is that it is really dangerous to travel in these conditions on such a narrow road with curves and pedestrians..... Little happens to them.

As for the drivers, they are unpresentable, with a deplorable attitude towards the customer, aware of the scam they offer and wanting to laugh at those of us who suffer from it.
When trying to get on a bus on the way down from the palace, the driver did not allow us to pass, to which we complained because he had already passed us before and we had been waiting for more than an hour to get off. The driver's response was to yell at the bus saying it wasn't going to start, encouraging the rest of the bus to get off. Faced with this situation, we threatened to call the police because the screams he was making were not acceptable, to which he justified himself by saying ""I'm the professional, I've been doing this for 20 years"", the truth is that now it makes me laugh that boasts of professionalism. Seeing that there was no point in dealing with this person, we got off the bus to shouts and expletives from the passengers, encouraged by the driver. When I claimed it, the driver closed the door, hitting my partner and running away, doing an act of bravery and a clear demonstration of the attitude and intentions of this mafia.

Finally, we went to the company's office to file the claim. We asked for the complaint form, which we wanted to take to the police to write it up and let them know the treatment received.
The lady who served us refused to give us the sheet if we took it with us. Finally, after arguing, he gave it to us and when he was about to leave, he left the office to snatch the sheet from me and shove us out of the store with insults. UNHEARD is the treatment received by this company, which takes advantage of tourists",1
Appalling,"Shame driver and receptionist. They don't help, they are rude and on top of paying a real outrage the only thing they tell you is to take the next one. I have had to wait for 2 days and I have been there for more than 1 hour and a half to try to catch a bus for which I had already paid, every day mind you. Terrible service and treatment.",1
Fraud company cheaters,"Fraud company , overcharges , rude staff
Don’t travel with them avoid
They overcharge you instead of listed fare of 7.5 dollars they charge you maximum fare",1
Scammed and attacked,"I do not recommend taking these buses at all. We went on 08/08/2023 in the morning to buy round-trip tickets, which is indicated on their website. The woman who was there told us that these tickets were only for groups (which is false since the website does not refer to groups), and that she only sold us the full-day ticket for €12.50 per person. My husband told him that he should give us those bills and a complaint form. She started shouting expletives and refused to sell us the tickets or give us the complaint form. When I saw that things were getting ugly I started to record it and when she saw me she came towards me like crazy and tried to snatch the phone out of my hands. We were struggling because I couldn't let go of my phone, I was totally out of my mind. Between my husband and a bus driver, they managed to get me to let go and he forced me to delete the video in which it was seen how he scammed and insulted us. My hands were covered in scratches. A person in these conditions is not qualified to work in front of the public. It's a shame to go visit such a beautiful place and be treated that way. Scammed, verbally and physically attacked. In short, life will take care of giving you what you deserve. Conclusion: better to take a tuk tuk.",1
Not a Hop on Hop off service.,"OK, so not the hop on hop off experience that most expect, Firstly, we were very quickly loaded onto the bus, No seats available, then kept standing there for a further 10 minutes as more people were packed onto the bus, to the point you felt like the fish in tins that are so loved in Lisbon. The bust started on the journey, to wherever it was, because no information was given by the driver, At one point he said ""Garden"", as if this was somehow relevant information, and two people got of, 5 more got on making an already uncomfortable trip even more so. We went to the moreish castle, very impressive, But Im still not sure it was worth the extra €45 we had paid to get there, the €22 entry was worth it though.

Pick a number of passengers, and stick to it, Far too many people on the bus to make it an enjoyable experience.",1
Vente forcée,"Surtout, si vous ne voulez faire que Pena, ne pas acheter de ticket dans le bus, ils vous arnaquent en vous faisant croire que le seul ticket possible est un 24h pour 12€50 ! Il faut aller au bureau de vente de la compagnie situé en face de la gare. Là il faut encore demander pour avoir seulement un aller à 4,10€ par personne sinon ils vous vendent le billet 24h. Les chauffeurs de bus ne renseignent pas du tout, ils doivent être payés à la commission !",1
Worst experience ever,"THIS IS THE WORST! First of all, it costs a whopping €15,00. The busses simply don’t show up. We waited hours, but not a single sign of a bus. When you’re extremely lucky and manage to see a bus, they just drive by with a half-empty bus. Do yourself a favor and take a taxi or tuk-tuk. AVOID THIS COMPANY COMPLETELY!",1
"Don't, just don't","Most terrible service ever!! First off all it costs 15.00 euro per person. Its not worth your money, they just dont show up or drive past without any notice. We had to walk most of the time because of it. Please do yourself a favour and take a taxi or tuk tuk......",1
Pessima esperienza,"Pessima esperienza! Volevo visitare Montserrate Palace e ho acquistato il biglietto da € 15.00 tanto pubblicizzato.
Sono salita alla stazione di Sintra, sul bus 435. L'autista ha sparato a mille la musica: assordante e sgradevole. Non ha fatto fermate e ci ha riportati, dopo un lungo giro, alla stazione di Sintra.
Alle lamentele dei turisti, increduli e arrabbiati, ha risposto che Montserrate era chiuso.
E perché non é stato detto o segnalato fin dell'inizio? Perché dovrebbe essere interessante fare un giro a vuoto?
Ho perso soldi, tempo e non ho potuto vedere nulla.",1
Kein Verlass!,"Ich würde den Bus auf keinen Fall mehr buchen. Es ist einfach kein Verlass. Wir haben über eine Stunde auf den Bus gewartet und haben deshalb den bereits bezahlten Eintritt in den Monserrate Palast verpasst. Eigentlich sollte er alle 20 Minuten fahren. Für die paar Kilometer, die man mit dem Bus zurücklegt sind 15 Euro auch viel zu viel. Nehmt besser ein TukTuk, die sind flexibel und auf Zuruf verfügbar.",1
Pésimo servicio y caro,"Pésimo servicio y caro. Tienen publicidad engañosa porque no sube al palacio de la pena como pone ahí, pero lo peor es que no recogen al cierre de los palacios. Un conductor nos ha dicho que cada media hora pasaba una y hemos estado esperando una hora y no ha pasado ninguno. Una vergüenza de servicio.",1
Poor service on bus 435 in Sintra,"We took bus 435 to shuttle between the Regaleira Palace, the Monserrate Palace, and the Sintra train station. There was no published schedule in the brochure. We have to wait a long time for the bus at each stop. The bus was also very crowded being a small bus. it was not a pleasant experience.",2
Scandaleuse arnaque !,"Tout d’abord, je déconseille le déplacement vers Sintra.
Le voyage en train est assez déprimant, qui traverse des banlieues, absolument sinistres, noyées sous le béton.
Sintra était peut-être autrefois un joli petit village, dans un espace montagneux verdoyant.
Victime de son succès, ils est très difficile de s’y déplacer à pied ou sur les petites routes, totalement encombrées par les autocars de tourisme, les tuk tuk et les automobiles.
La visite du village lui-même n’a pas grand intérêt, les ruelles étroites sont noyées sous les flots de touristes qui se ruent dans les multiples échoppes, qui vendent des souvenirs frelatés, fabriqués à des millions d’exemplaires…
Le pire, c’est le ticket de 15 € que la compagnie de bus vous vend pour faire le tour des différents châteaux à visiter.
Le jour où nous sommes venus, le 9 juin, nous nous sommes acquittés du prix de ce transport, et nous sommes montés dans le bus, sans que la personne chargée de vendre les tickets n’ait pris la peine de nous informer que tous les châteaux, à l’exception d’un seul, était fermés, en raison d’une grève…
Quelle malhonnêteté !
Comme les autres, nous avons donc parcouru un trajet interminable à l’allure d’un escargot , (bien que très court en kilomètres), en pure perte, puisque nous n’avons pu rien visiter.
J’ai écrit à la compagnie pour être remboursé de ses billets.
J’attends toujours la réponse…
A la lumière de mon expérience, je mesure combien Sintra doit être un véritable enfer pendant la haute saison touristique, en juillet août.
Épargnez -vous surtout cette peine !
Aller plutôt visiter l’église Notre-Dame de Lorette des Italiens , à Lisbonne, c’est une merveille incroyable, qu’ on ne soupçonnerait pas si on n’était pas poussé par la curiosité de pousser la porte.
Et c’est gratuit !",1
GARBAGE,"The buses were nonexistent on certain routes, paid expensive and still had to walk. Terrible company.",1
Avoid at all costs. Take local transport or tuk tuk instead.,"If i could rate it zero i would. Utterly misleading. Buses anyways cramped, the guardrails were broken in two if the buses. Instead of letting passengers know, the driver stood there laughing every time someone tripped on the rail. Drivers deliberately give misinformation - when asked where to take 435 bus, they said go to next stop - no such stop.
Just take local transport and support the economy than this lying pos company. The tuk tuk drivers were much more honest and forthcoming with information.",1
BEWARE⚠️,"BEWARE! Make sure castles are opened as strikes have occurred randomly without notice at all castles except the Quinta da Regaleira for the past few months. When the bus sales ticket agent was questioned she responded, “I sold you a ticket for a bus, not for castle admission.” Hundreds, if not thousands of tourists were stuck in long lines at closed castles trying to get a return seat. Shameful business practices. Perhaps they are preparing for Boca de Inferno?",1
Lied to for an over priced bus ride,"DO NOT LIE!!! Over crowded buses and they said entry into the palaces was included in the price, it was not! Labelling the buses public is misleading, commentary is NOT worth the extra money AVOID, AVOID AVOID",1
Un servizio pessimo,Abbiamo pagato l'abbonamento giornaliero chiedendo anticipatamente il servizio offerto e ci è stato detto che vi erano 15 bus che giravano continuamente passando ogni quindici minuti da ogni stazione. Preso il primo bus non siamo più riusciti ad usufruire del servizio in quanto i bus o non si fermavano perché pieni o non passavano proprio.,1
Ripoff,Appalling customer service. They knew there were road works so only one route open but sold tickets for both. And then refused to give a refund despite drivers saying there eoukd be no bus,1
Mauvaise expérience,"Mauvaise expérience
On pensait que la gare de Sintra était en face du parking gratuit P1N
En fait la gare de Sintra où l'on peut prendre les bus 434 et 435 pour les palais de la Pena et quinta de la regaleira est à 15 mn à pied en direction du centre de Sintra.
Nous avons attendu le bus 434 ( arrêt de bus matérialisé) pour le palais de la Pena pendant 1/2 h avant de se rendre compte que l'arrêt était en fait 50m plus loin ( plusieurs bus étaient passés devant nous sans s'arrêter). Quand nous avons fait remarquer que l'on avait attendu à l'arrêt marqué 434 on nous a retorqué que le véritable arrêt était celui ci !!!
Après la visite du palais de Pena nous sommes revenus devant la gare pour prendre le bus pour la quinta de la Regaleira ; pas de chance une partie du parcours du bus n'était pas accessible et nous avons du reprendre le bus 434 qui nous a laissé à l'arrêt Quinta de la Regaleira mais qui demande une marche de 15 mn pour accéder au site.
Beaucoup de temps de perdu et avec un coût élevé pour le forfait bus journée à 11,5 € par personne.",1
Autobús 434 a Pena muy caro,"Engañan al turista , en la misma estación de Sintra donde se toma el autobús 434 para subir a sintra , paran taxis y tuc tucs , el taxi cuesta LO MISMO el trayecto y puedes decirle a más gente si quiere subir contigo y compartís gastos , no vayáis en bus , son 11'50 por persona , es un robo , el taxi cuesta lo mismo y si subís 4 personas saldréis a 3 euros,",1
Do yourselves a favor and take a cab,"On paper, the idea is great. There is an affordable hop on hop off service, running every 20 minutes, taking you to all Sintra s landmarks. Then you arrive and pay for the ticket and wait 50 minutes for the bus to arrive. It arrives. The driver parks and tells you they'll be back in 5 minutes. You wait another 10 minutes. The driver arrives. Finally you go. Then your visit is over. It's five thirty pm on 3 January. It is chilly. You start waiting for the bus and it arrives AT SIX TWENTY (and remember, there is supposed to be one every 20 minutes) and the driver tells you that it is better if you walk, because he would like to keep the space on the bus for people at the further stops and walking it is only 15 minutes. Now. Letting aside that if I could have walked I would have. I am not giving zero stars because it's not possible. I would demand my money back if I could. Next time I'm taking a cab.",1
Unfortunately bad experience and for me not worth the price...! Shouldn't be sold like that.,"Unfortunately, I was blinded by the reviews. Contact with the owner was nice and friendly. Unfortunately, the tour was a total disaster. But that was probably more down to the captain of the day. It's more about speeding over the waves in a Zodiac (speedboat) and, with a bit of luck, spotting a dolphin or two. There are no real seats on the Zodiac, you sit alongside on benches and half of the people don't have a backrest. So far, OK. On our day, however, the waves were relatively high and the captain didn't care whether you got completely wet from the boat hitting the waves at full speed or whether you sprained your spine. After I complained, the captain threatened to leave me on a deserted island in the bay of Lisbon. But he didn't do that and just drove back to the harbor. The owner called after the tour and tried very kindly to clarify the situation and said he would get back in touch later, which I actually really liked. Unfortunately, the second call didn't come... My conclusion: This isn't about dolphin watching, but rather ""speedboating"" for too high a price. And there was definitely no marine biologist on board!",1
Over priced and under delivered,"We booked this tour partly based on the photos that the company posted on their webpage . Nothing could have been further than reality. The food was minimal. You only got half a Befana which was in all honesty quite bland - compared to one we ate in Porto . The “meal”:we had a the restaurant was ok but minimal . There was no cheese as shown in the advertising, the cured ham was one small piece rather than the plate of ham in the photos . We then had 1 croquette each which was half the size of a golf ball, a small slice of toast with a sardine , the “surprise dish” which to be honest was hardly surprising.
We then went to another location and had syrup soaked fig then to another location for the tart which was probably the highlight of the tour.
We left the tour quite underwhelmed.
We paid $300 AUD this money could have been better spent at a traditional restaurant, we would have been very satisfied and with change in our pocket.",2
There are better tours,"Lacked direction, food was minimal at best, the cost and delivery did not match a bit rushed and some facts told
Did not what was written.",1
Grossly overpriced....,"Vanda was a wonderful guide, great knowledge and food was good. Issue is the price. It is greatly overpriced. I chose a more expensive one specifically because I expected a more high quality experience at off hours (4-7 and thus a ""happy hour"" discount). $83euros/person + tip for half a pork sandwinch (whole sandwich us $3 eu), a piece of cheese and portuguese ham, a light dinner and a pasties da nata and espresso, is way too much. Live and learn.",2
Worst company to deal with,"One of the worst companies I had to deal with in Portugal. My daughter and I were not able to adapt on segway uphill - we requested to switch it to tuk tuk option, they agreed on that. Our original tour was 3 hour and it says on the site the time starts only after the customers are adapted to the segway. But they only gave us 2 hour tour claiming that we wasted their time adapting to the segway. Also, claiming that we requested them to stop the tour in 2 hours. I will never deal with companies who like to take advantage and make dimes off frauding the tourists.",1
not what we expected as far as customer service and punctuality,the driver/guide did not arrive on time; he was rude and after getting in the van he was rude to one girl of our group; this made us get off the van and not take the tour.,1

Prix excessifs pour repas mauvais
Chanteurs et musiciens au top mais prestation trop courte et ponctuelle",1
Fine but could be much better,"The location of the bar itself is great and it isn't expensive. The staff was pleasant, although I wasn't a fan of one of the bartenders.
I find it unprofessional to be frequently on the phone with headphone and speaking arabic during the shift, and worse, making video calls, which can easily record us clients while we would prefer to keep our privacy.
I personally found it quite disrespectful.",2

Atendentes grosseiros e xenófobos,"Fui diversas vezes ao Shelter e gostava muito. Apesar de saber da já famosa grosseria e xenofobia do staff nunca tinha sido de fato mal atendido. Porém ontem à noite tive uma péssima experiência. Estava com mais 4 amigos, havia pouca gente no bar pois estava chovendo, e ao fim ficou só o nosso grupo. Os funcionários então resolveram fechar, apesar de estarmos todos ainda com copos cheios de cerveja, que haviam acabado de nos vender, acenderam as luzes e tiraram a música. Entendemos que era hora de ir embora, apesar de ser muito antes do horário normal de fechamento do bar. Pedimos copos descartáveis para levar então a cerveja recém comprada e ao sair vimos que estava chovendo muito forte. Pedimos para ficar na entrada do bar enquanto esperávamos nossos ubers, mas o funcionário simplesmente disse não e bateu a porta, nos deixando debaixo de um pequeno toldo com uma chuva torrencial. Por sorte um de nós tinha um guarda chuvas, e conseguimos nos abrigar minimamente no toldo e chamar nossos carros. Passados alguns minutos o outro funcionário do bar abriu a porta e disse que ia recolher o toldo! Ou seja, ia nos deixar na chuva forte! Por sorte os ubers chegaram logo, senão teríamos ficado encharcados por pura maldade dos funcionários do bar. No mínimo irônico em um lugar que se chama SHELTER e se diz um ambiente acolhedor.",1
Mix of crap music and nasty staff,"Went there to have a good time, instead got crap music and nasty staff. Not planing to go back anytime soon",1
Poor,The staff had great communication when booking an appointment. I went for a relaxing massage with oil. The massage room was quite nosy as it was close to the entrance and there was only a curtain as separation. The massage was quite vigorous despite me asking for relaxing. I ended up with swollen and painful temples as a result of the head massage section. I was also quite disappointed when the masseuse walked out abruptly during the massage to serve another customer. This time was not reclaimed. Not really what I was expecting.,2
Avoid for dinner!,"Overpriced for ordinary quality (we eat just as well or better in a regular sushi place around the corner, but for 5 times less expensive)

No seasoning, €12 for 2 gyozas, €6 for a carafe of tap water, €26 for a small bowl of dry rice with 4 small slices of salmon on top...

Oppressive and cold service (surprising but true)

We pay for the view and the decoration.

Go as far as possible to have a drink with a view, because the cocktails are good.",1
A disappointment,"Great view of the city.
Nice service.
Below average food at prices that were beyond good and evil.
Would definitely not recommend this place for dinner.",2
NOT WORTH IT,"Service leaves something to be desired, the price is absurdly incoherent, I've been to several in Lisbon such as SUD, Sala de Corte, Brilhante among others. I don't mind paying a higher price but it needs to be very good. Paying a lot for nothing doesn't make sense, so it's worth warning because this place despite a beautiful view (the only thing) is outdated music... it's not worth it. The portions are mega small and the prices are super high, famous as “tourist catch”.

I'll leave a photo of the chicken kebab that costs €15 and the pieces are smaller than an olive 🫒(I said I wouldn't pay) they removed the price but it costs €15.",1
very bad,very bad place small menu card no stock of things on the menu very bad experience not recommended,1
Just OK and overpriced,Not as impressive as they like to think. Sushi was OK. Overpriced. Service was OK. Great view but unfortunately that's the only thing really positive about this place. Which was disappointing as I pre booked weeks before my trip to Lisbon. Lots of nicer places so don't waste your money here.,2

odd,We went for late night drinks and the vibe was strange. Entry is via a dingy lobby and elevator. My mojito was warm and tasted horrible - expensive too. We left quickly as there was a strange atmosphere - which was hard to pinpoint.,1
Fomos expulsos por não terem clientes,"Absolutamente terrível! Eu e os meus amigos decidimos dar uma oportunidade ao Silk Bar Rooftop, mas fomos tratados com total desrespeito e desprezo. Pagámos a exorbitante quantia de 20 euros para entrar, apenas para sermos expulsos como se fôssemos lixo!

Quando perguntámos sobre a hora de encerramento, disseram-nos que o bar fechava às 3 horas. No entanto, às 2 horas em ponto, fomos mandados embora. O segurança responsável pela expulsão foi rude e seco, sem o mínimo respeito pela nossa presença. Foi uma clara demonstração de falta de profissionalismo e falta de consideração pelos clientes.

Indignados com esta atitude, procurámos o gerente para expressar a nossa insatisfação. No entanto, ele simplesmente recusou-se a fazer qualquer coisa, alegando que estavam a fechar mais cedo devido à falta de público. A sério? É assim que tratam os clientes que pagaram para entrar? Simplesmente fecham as portas porque não têm pessoas suficientes?

Há muitos outros bares e rooftops na cidade que oferecem um tratamento muito melhor aos seus clientes. Definitivamente, não recomendo o Silk Bar Rooftop a ninguém!",1
Passez votre chemin,"On est accueilli dans le hall d’entrée de l’immeuble par quelqu’un qui vous explique que le rooftop est accessible pour la modique somme de 20€ avec une boisson incluse … les cocktails sont entre 14 et 22€.
Nous avons pris un Gin Garden chacun a 18€ inclus donc dans le forfait de 20€. Pas trop mal mais à 20€ le cocktail ça ne vaut vraiment pas le coup.
La vue est bien mais la terrasse est assez petite.
Les serveurs étaient par contre sympathiques.
Nous avons ensuite découvert le Palacio Ciado qui propose d’excellents cocktails sensiblement moins chers et dans une ambiance unique/atypique.",2
Para enganar turistas.,"Espaço com algum interesse no interior, no exterior muito pobre e pouco cuidado. De lamentar que não se possa aproveitar o sol para usar o exterior para beber e comer, sendo que é proibido comer no exterior.

Mas o que fiquei mesmo estarrecido, foi o com o preço das bebidas, já que estas não tem qualidade nenhuma, e sobre os valores da comida.
Consumimos, 1 caipiroska de maracujá que estava horrível, um Porto Tonic, 2 gyosas, 2 peças de niguiris com peixe branco e 1 carpaccio de salmão. Pagámos 72 euros. Seria para jantar mas pagámos está conta e fomos jantar ao lado no Boteco.

Dissapointing experience for our destination wedding - would not recommend,"We used SimplyBus as the transportation service for our 250 person destination wedding. For us it was this was a very important service for our wedding as every single person was form outside of the country, and wanted to ensure the experience coming in and out of our venue was a good one. We paid to have buses every 30mins starting at midnight until 430am for the comfort of our guests. SimplyBus showed up delayed and failed to meet the required timelines through the night causing a lot of discomfort for our guests, some of which had to wait ~45mins for the bus to show up and leave. Not to mention that we had paid for a service that was not delivered. When we tried to address the issue with the team, they ignored us and completely disregarded that they did not meet our agreement. I would not recommend Simply Bus to anyone that expects a relaible service and good customer service.

In summary, our experience with Simply Bus was marred not only by delays on our wedding day but also by their refusal to address the issues afterward. The impact on our guests' experience was substantial, and the lack of a satisfactory resolution speaks volumes about their commitment to customer satisfaction",1
No show host,Terrible! The host did not show up and did not inform me the tour was canceled. We were there early and waited for 15 minutes before calling to inquire about the tour. The shop has been renamed by the new owners and confirmed I was at the right place. The help line staff couldn't reach the guide so we left. It ruined my day as I had made plans based on this tour. This provider should not be allowed to work on tours for you!,1

"Attention, please do not rent cars here.","In September 2024, out of necessity, I once rented a car with Sixt at Lisbon Airport for a lot of money, other rental companies were half cheaper, but I only had my credit card digitally and not physically with me, which was the favor of the hour for Sixt to relieve my wallet. I had resigned myself to it, should have expected that not all landlords accept digital cards. But the real hammer came only later. SIXT wrote to me and told me that I still had to pay the tolls to the Pagamento de Portagens (Administration for Tolls). The rental cars are equipped with sensors and the SIXT dealer had told me that the fees are fully covered by the rental price. This is primitive rip-off, please don't.",1
excessive unjustified charges,"I had an incredibly disappointing experience with SIXT, which has left me feeling completely taken advantage of. After a simple tire puncture from a nail, SIXT arranged for a tow truck and a replacement vehicle without informing me of any alternatives. They chose to bring a replacement car from Porto, instead of the much closer city, and then charged me over 400 Euros for this service—without giving me any advance notice of the cost.

To make matters worse, SIXT charged me 190 Euros for a single tire replacement on a Dacia Jogger, even though a new tire typically costs around 80 Euros. They also charged me for road assistance, despite my contract clearly stating that it was covered under “Extended Assistance.” When I returned the towed car with a nearly full tank, SIXT billed me over 90 Euros for fuel, and after a complaint, only 30 Euros were refunded.

This experience feels like SIXT is taking advantage of customers through hidden fees and a lack of transparency. I complied with all my contract obligations, yet I was hit with excessive charges. This is not only frustrating but feels borderline unethical. I’m considering filing a formal complaint and would strongly advise others to be cautious when dealing with SIXT.",1
Sixt Lisbon Airport is Awful,Do not rent from sixt lisbon airport. Useless human beings in a god awful process. 2 hours to get car. Its worse than the seinfield episode.,1
"Terrible experience with Sixt car rental, Lisbon city center","I have just written a review regarding waiting for 2 hours at Lisbon airport to pick up the car. We thought that was bad, but the worse is yet to come, when we dropped off the car at a Lisbon city location.
When we booked our car online, we chose to drop off at a Sixt office located at the carpark of Hotel Tivoli, as it was more convenient for us. It was accepted by the system. When we picked up the car at Lisbon airport, the staff further confirmed with us the drop off time, date and the depot office are all ok, and printed the address of the depot office at Hotel Tivoli carpark with its opening hours. It reads “Sunday - 9 am to 6 pm”.
So that was it, at least we thought so. When we arrived at the return depot on the Sunday, the office was closed! The door of the office said Sunday - Closed. So we called the hotline and obviously they didn’t know how to handle and put us on hold. After much waiting, they suggested us to drop off at another location which was a bit far away. But we could not do it as we have already made plans and reservation that we have to go to. Even without this, it is not our responsibility to drop off to another location. After a while, the help line reluctantly asked us to park the car in the hotel garage and return the keys and the parking ticket to the hotel reception. This is after 30 mins on the phone. So we did as was told but when we tried to drop the key and the ticket at the hotel reception, it refused to take them as there was no instruction from Sixt and they didn’t want anything to do with it.

So we called the hotline again and another staff answered our call. He repeatedly asked us to drop off to the other location. We said we couldn’t as we have an appointment. He put us on hold and then hang up on us. This was another 30 mins!

We have no choice but to leave the car at the hotel car park. The next morning at 9 am, we made a special trip and returned the car keys back to SIXT's office at the Hotel Tivoli. Once we showed them the parking ticket, they said we have to pay for the parking fees, how ridiculous! We refused and after some checking, the staff came back and said that we are ‘lucky’ as the hotel won’t charge it!!!! They even dare to tell us that this is not their mistake, it was the airport office colleaques' mistake as they have told them many times that this office does not open on Sunday. What kind of attitude and customer service??? We, as customer, had to go through all this nonsense and at our precious time to make a special trip to return the keys, not to say that we are tourists with only limited time in the city. Instead of getting apologies and appreciation in return, we received such 'service'. Very disappointingly, the SIXT's staffs at the Hotline and in the office at Hotel Tivoli were impolite, unprofessional and absolutely unhelpful, not to mention SIXT's management and its on line system really requires some major reviewing and revamping. Bottom line, I shall never return to SIXT!",1
Beware Sixt,"This company rents decent cars. BUT, they do try to strong arm you AFTER returning the vehicle. This is first-hand experience. Burn mark in a seat cover, made by a NON smoker. ? A button on steering g wheel popped off. It is a volume control tab for an unused radio.
So, beware, they will bill your credit card for damages you've not done. In spite of accepting the option of full coverage, Insurances via them.",1
The worst service experience in Lisbon,"The worst gastronomic and service experience I've had lately. Excellent, bad service, very dirty bathrooms... all bad. It may be very well decorated and have fantastic views, but that's not enough...",1
Disappointing and Exorbitant Prices,"The experience at Sky Bar Oriente was far below expectations. To begin with, the sound environment was almost non-existent – an indefinite background noise, without any decent ambient music. A space of this level should invest in an appropriate sound system, which would really create a pleasant environment.

The prices are simply absurd. There is no single bottle of wine for less than 30€, which is already an exaggeration, and the food follows the same pattern: 4 guides, 8 pieces of sashimi and a small nail cost about 100€. To make it worse, the sashimi was of doubtful quality and I don't know anything special about it. If it was a top-notch restaurant, maybe the price would be justified, but here it seemed just an exploitation.

In addition, the place was poorly visited, which would not be expected in a space that costs so much for the experience. In short, a place that could be a reference point, but that fails in both the gastronomic offer and the environment. I do not recommend and will definitely not come back.",1
Bad behaviour,"Bad service all staffs are use bad language with clients they don't have any kind of experience about high profile bars, how to treat clients. Do arguments with us about reserve tables.",1

Great view terrible customer service,"Great view with potential for being a great place to sit back and relax with friends. Unfortunately our 2 experiences were not positive!
As guests of the Tivoli hotel we invited friends to join us at Sky Bar. Upon arrival, we were asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside. I walked over to the outside to see how it felt. The Brasilian waiter very quickly said, ""you can't go out there without unless Isay so"" I didn't realize it was so restrictive. Considering it was 35°C outside and around 29 inside NO AIRCON!! I was looking for the coolest place for us to sit. The rest of our 3 hours there were forgettable. Service is 1*. The worst daiquiri we've ever had, when we asked if they had some kind of munchies to accompany the drinks, it took 10 minutes for them to show up with thimble sized bowl of nuts.
The second day we went up there ( the view is great)we asked for an outdoor table. We were seated in a back corner, all the nice seats were taken.
The gentleman who sat us said if one of the nicer tables became available they would move us. Before we even looked at our menus, two tables became available immediately and we moved to the one with two empty glasses from the previous guests. The same Brasilian waiter came to us a few minutes later and, once again, scolded us because we couldn't sit there until he cleaned the coffee table!! Really?! Instead of coming over with a ""allow me to clean this table for you"" he made a point of scolding as if we were children!!! So we walked out!!",2

Long lines to enter even after purchasing ticket,"Even after you purchase your tickets there was , at least, an hour long wait time in line to enter. Plus the ticket office, on site, apparently closes for 1.5-2 hours each day around noon.
Very interesting looking from the outside, but after asking several other tourists who had been inside, and the ticket office employee (who was very patient and informative), we decided to not wait 1-2 hours standing in line to get in the austere Belem tower. Several people said that the monastery down the street (walking distance) was a stupendous example of Manuelleta architecture, and definitely worth the wait in line. And the famous original Belem pastry shop is close to the monastery.",2
Captain left my family at the dock yelling “welcome to portugal”,"There are so many great sailing companies in Lisbon I recommend taking any other besides this one. We setup a pickup at the dock at 7:15. We arrived at 7:10 and after multiple calls to the office asking where the boat was it finally came at 7:45. I asked about the delay and he proceeded to yell at me, tell me their delay was my fault, and that we weren’t there on time (I sent him picture evidence showing that we were there on time). He was triggered by the picture evidence and responded by screaming at me that we weren’t in America anymore, welcome to Portugal, and that we couldn’t come on the boat. My family and I had this specially planned on our last evening of the trip, so this was a bummer. We thankfully were able to shake this off and have a wonderful evening elsewhere, but I’d be aware of the owner of this company — he was out of control and continued to message me me via WhatsApp in such a horrible way that I had to block him. I hope you can find a company that won’t cancel on you and yell at you.",1

Host cancelled five minutes before tour,"Tour guide cancelled on us 5 minutes before the tour was going to begin, claiming car problems (we were already waiting in the meeting place). If you had car problems, you would know more than 5 min in advance. I think they cancelled because they didn’t have enough people and it wasn’t worth their while.
We still tried to go to Sintra on our own, which was very difficult without a car or any reservations to the various attractions.
It was a very disappointing experience. Beware before booking!!",1
Anticolonial Lisbon,"A recent statue, inaugurated just eight years ago, romanticizes the ""exploits"" of this man, a Portuguese man who went to Brazil where, in the name of religion, he committed genocide against indigenous communities, murdering the fathers and mothers of children whom he then sent to the order's schools, where they were abused, raped, and murdered. We must be critical of the colonial history of European countries; it is no longer time to give rise to heroes for murderers, plunderers, and genocidaires.",1
Didn't get a tour.,"We were 20 minutes late and could never connect with the guide. He kindly sent us a link to show where he was as he walked along; however, he was never where the ""X"" indicated. At one point the ""x"" didn't move for 10 minutes and we stood there looking for him. We gave up after 30 minutes so we never had a tour. Very disappointed.",1
Awful,"Awful. Drivers are rude, don’t ideal English and wait for people who are late to the detriment of the schedule. My pick up was 45 min late so I nearly missed my flight and the WhatsApp people kept telling me they would be there in 10 minutes. Never again.",1
Rubbish company,"Do not not use this company,10 of us left stranded at Faro airport as the chaos of passport control meant we were late to get out and, and the driver would only wait for an hour, apparently all the locals hire companies know of this problem and they allow extra time but this lot wouldn't wait , they still took our money, upon the return journey the driver was speeding so much on the motorway we had to ask him to slow down as we actually thought we might not make it home to our families. Avoid these cowboys at all cost.",1
Sun Transfers do not use,This company failed to show up for our return journey and I have been trying to get refund for over 45 days. Impossible to get money back from them. Do not use unless you want to get robbed. Theft is their most reliable attribute.,1
Taxi pickup no show,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
Transfer from hotel in Alvor Portugal to airport never arrived we were left with 6 small children and 13 adults
Panic - had to take 3 Maxi taxis who drove like the wind to get us there in time to catch the flight back to the UK
They didn't answer my calls or emails basically took my money
Do not book this company",1
Failed in Funchal,"Booked Suntranfers for travel between airport and hotel in Funchal. On the way out, BA cancelled our flight with 6 hours notice so we went out a day late. Had to pay again for the sun transfers pick up. Pickup from airport worked ok.
For the return, received confirmation msg 24 hrs before, but then nothing turned up to get us back to airport. We had to get our own taxi.
I put in a refund claim to Suntransfers, which was eventually paid. The email response was very patronising and more or less blamed us!
They said that they have a contact number to resolve and quickly fix issues and they would expect customers to ring it. I had rung it (twice). They couldn’t find the booking.
They said that on this occasion they would make the refund because the driver had not contacted them either.
An apology rather than a patronising email would have been more appropriate.
Never again!",1
Stay Away From This Horrible… So called co,Horrible Co to deal with. STAW AWAY. Cancelled my pre booked and fully paid taxi without telling me and my young family. We were to be picked up from accommodation to airport at 3 in the morning… we had four young kids under 10 …. Never replied to phone calls .. never replied to emails… when we eventually spoke with spoke with someone.. they hung up. They didn’t care..,1
Absolute Crap,"Arrived at Funchal airport, driver not there called customer services and put on hold. 15 minutes on WhatsApp to try and get a response. Got a cab in the end.",1
Rubbish service,Absolute rubbish an hour late then he turns up no offer to help with bags or any normal behaviour. Might as well have booked a taxi from side of street,1
Left stranded with kids late night. Lost 200 euros. Avoid.,"Paid 200 euros for a transfer from Lisbon airport. Plane landed only 20 minutes late. Some queues at passport. Communicated immediately to advise. Driver said he was waiting and very friendly by message. But he left the airport and didn't even tell us he was leaving. We were left stranded at the airport. Kids in tears. Had to eventually find a taxi with a price we could afford. Email was pretty efficient though - saying no refunds, take it up with airline. Disaster class of a service. Leaves you upset and having paid more than twice what you thought once you have to make emergency arrangements. Feels like have been scammed. What an awful start to a family holiday. Cue the cut and paste 'management' response on here which will be empathetic but not serve any purpose or provide any refund. You have all been warned. Avoid",1
No guarantees!,On arrival at Faro airport the queue for passport control was chaos. I had booked a taxi with Suntransfer.com to take us to our hotel in Albufeira. After 40 minutes in the queue I had a call from Suntransfers to say they would only wait 1 hr. They then phoned again after an hour to say the driver wouldn’t wait any longer. I pleaded as we were about 10 people from the front of the queue. They declined!!! My friend and I then had to pay 80 euros to get a taxi. I would never use this company again as no refund was offered by them when I complained. Beware!,1
Sun transfers drivers,"I can honestly say this was by far the worst experience of transfers I’ve ever witnessed. I’m not usually one for writing reviews but from start to finish with our transfers has been nothing but a nightmare!!!
The first driver turned up an 25 mins late picking us up and then said he was there looking for us and blamed myself and my family although we were standing exactly where we were told to be.
Secondly we received a WhatsApp message telling us that our transfer driver picking us up was going to be early due to traffic… he turned up 2 hours early. Not quite sure why??
When we finally had all our belonging together to put in his vehicle he told us all to hurry up and then moaned about the time.
Yes I reacted and told him we are leaving early and weren’t due to leave for quite some time so we were potentially doing him the favour.
All in all very rude and complained about the service they were providing us, as though we have had them out of pocket.
I can’t speak for all drivers but from the ones I’ve now experienced. Very unprofessional and a smile wouldn’t kill either",1
BEWARE and NEVER use this company!,"BEWARE! This transfer company is a scam and do not deliver what they say. I booked and prepaid an airport transfer at BKK airport. The service I paid for and the instructions I was given was for a driver to meet and greet me at the arrivals hall. This did not happen. I was sent a text with a photo of a piece of paper with my surname on it and I had to find it within the entire arrivals hall at BKK airport. This area is massive. It took me 15 min to walk around and find it. Once I found it, I was met with rude staff sitting on the airport floor eating food and telling me to wait for them to call me when the driver arrived! I waited 20min for them to tell me the driver was outside. The driver was not waiting outside and I returned to the rude women twice to advise them the driver was not outside. Because I had interrupted them eating their dinner, they were hurling abuse at me while one of them walked outside to try and find the driver. Once the driver was located, his car was a tiny hatchback which did not fit my partners and my luggage. I had booked a Toyota Camary. The terms and conditions stated that if a Toyota Camary was not available, a car of GREATER size would be allocated. This was not the case. I asked them to arrange a car that was a suitable size. I then received abuse from the driver and the transfer woman. By this time over an hour had lapsed from when I arrived in the arrivals hall. They told me they were not going to arrange a new transfer so I had to go downstairs and catch a taxi to my hotel.
Because I had already booked and prepaid the return transfer, I promptly cancelled this. On the day of my return to the airport, the transfer company sent a text saying my transfer had arrived even after I had cancelled it!
I would NEVER NEVER recommend this transfer company to anyone. Please avoid this company at all costs.",1
Dreadful service!,"Shocking service - AGAIN! We've been provided with dreadful service on two occasions now. On both outward flights - to Tenerife and Faro - we waited for over 30 minutes for our pick-ups at the airports. And, for the return flight from Faro, the company was unable to move our pick up from the hotel to help us get an earlier flight back to the UK due to adverse weather conditions!",1
Transfer from Hurghada airport to hotel in Makadi Bay: no driver available,"I booked a transfer from Hurghada airport to a hotel in Makadi Bay. There's not much you can really do wrong: when you leave the terminal, you immediately see a group of tour guides and taxi drivers with name signs. But my transfer wasn't there. After waiting for about 30 minutes, I ended up taking another taxi. It wasn't until I was driving to the hotel in the Uber taxi that Suntransfers tried to call me.

Later, after I complained, they claimed that the driver hadn't found me. No refund.

Well... I've actually had good experiences with Suntransfers several times in the past, but I don't want to deal with complications like that. And when a transfer goes wrong and there's no refund, all I can say is: Thanks, not with me!",1
Awful,"Never use this company, our transfer never showed and we made our flight by the skin of our teeth and was left out of pocket",1
"Late for meet & greet, booster seats missing","We booked two personal transfers from Antalya airport and one to the airport.

In both outward trips, the driver was not waiting for us as promised, and we had to contact the transfer agency to find out what was going on. They then directed us to a different meeting point, giving the impression that the driver was somehow around but we had trouble finding each other.

After about 15 minutes of waiting (and roughly 1h after flight arrival), the driver then arrived at the new meeting point. It was obvious that they were coming from the parking lot and thus only had just arrived.

Pickup for the transfer to the airport was on-time.

We paid an extra fee for booster seats which were missing on both trips. When complaining about this, Suntransfers informed us that their terms and conditions specified that these were ""on a best effort basis only, and not guaranteed"" and that we could request a refund for the fee. So far (2 weeks later) I still haven't received the refund.

The vehicles were okay, but in one case the seatbelts were not working.

Driver was reasonably courteous.",2
No Show,Disguisted. A no show to collect us from Madrid Airport. After several phone calls advised take a Taxi and lodge a complaint. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - Warning,1
AVOID AVOID AVOID,"Was waiting upon arrival for 20/25 mins after being told driver just parking be 5 mins. Had to make 2 phone calls to see where he was. On return they booked us 2 Ubers, the wrong address was given for a start had to ring taxis He arrived 5 mins late and didn’t know if the second was on way. We all got illegally into 1 car as didn’t know if second taxi on way. While on way to the airport the second taxi rang to say waiting at address, he was 30 mins late! We booked a premium van so no way did we get what we paid for! Asked for a refund, offered the sum of €10 refund!! What a joke, considering we paid nearly £100. Will never use these cowboys again",1
"Terrible, hot, sweaty.....never again!","Absolutely shocking service. I paid for a return minibus from Faro airport to our apartment. We waited 20 minutes at Faro for a little car to arrive (wrong size car), luckily we only had 1 big base with 5 little cases (otherwise we probably would have had to hold them on our laps), the seat which was in the boot wasn't big enough for a cat, let alone a adult or a child. The wrong car arrived plus 20 minutes late, my poor son had to squeeze in the back which had no air con or leg room (and he is small). I have since spoken to SunTransfers and I have emailed them with my concerns and told them how upset my young son was, he was hot and felt sick and had cases literally on him. They have not apologised or refunded this single journey but have had the cheek to say because of my sons affected leg, they will refund me 25 euros. We will never use them again. I have no words.",1
Do not use this transfer service!,The driver never arrived and the emergency number went straight to voicemail. Unfortunately we were not the only family with that experience waiting in arrivals and had to get a taxi from outside the airport.,1
Don’t get stranded abroad,I booked a series of round-trip transfers with this company and received a cancellation notices just hours before landing at the airport leaving us stranded abroad with no option. We had a group of 12 people that were left at the airport with no way to get to their hotel in a country where they didn’t speak the language with no warning. Do not book with this company. They will give you a refund but they will waste your time and ruin your vacation.,1
Two driver no-shows in the same trip!,"DO NOT book with this company in France! We were stranded at the airport for a couple hours do to a driver no-show. The customer service offices are in another country and do not have reliable communication with the drivers. On the way home, the driver went to the wrong address and would not re-route to the new address. I had to cancel with no refund! Uber is the way to go. Simple, reliable, and cheaper!",1
Use Uber instead,Booked a transfer so that the driver would be waiting and we could leave immediately. Was instructed to look for driver near Vodafone. They were shut so easy to miss and no one was showing our name. On going back I checked the long list of names under a different company and we were listed. The lady then rang for a driver and we had to wait 10 mins. The vehicle felt unsafe and groaned on corners. The driver had no idea where to go and we had to show him the address when he pulled into a rd miles away. Awful. Use Uber.,2
Absolute joke - avoid like the plague,"An absolute joke - didn't bother to turn up. My 8 year old son and I waited over an hour from the time the flight landed - albeit 12 minutes early and noting that Suntransfers.com's website states that they monitor arrival times and 50 minutes after the scheduled landing time and the driver never showed. Every other driver for those on our flight was waiting when we got through passport control around 11am. Telephone calls were handled rudely and false promises of ""they're nearly there, five minutes etc etc were given. In the end, after waiting nearly an hour, I had to get a taxi. Not great with a small child.

They told us on the phone that they have issues with drivers at Faro - funnily enough, they didn't tell me that when I paid them months ago.

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",1
INADMISSIBLE,"Nous avions réservé un véhicule mini-van pour 8 personnes pour le transfert de l'aéroport à notre location sur Lisbonne.
A notre arrivée, personne ne nous attendait. Nous avons attendus 1 heure et demie et rien. Entre temps nous avons essayé de joindre les numéros donnés dans les documents. Nous avons dû payer 2 taxis ( 48€ ) pour nous transporter jusqu'à notre appartement. Donc aucun service de transport malgré une facturation de 39,41€.
Je déconseille cette société.",1
Worst shuttle experience,Difficult to find the small box they are in to arrange transport. I walked way past it. Had to call and the lady was very helpful on the phone. Found the box and gave my name and asked how and was told had to wait for 5 more people. I waited 16 minutes then asked when are the others arriving. The lady did not know I said well how long do I wait or I will get a taxi as my flight was delayed 2 hours and now waiting for the shuttle. The lady said I must wait an hour. There was no clock I had travelled from New Zealand and was shattered. I asked her the time and she kept repeating you have been here 16 minutes!!! ZERO assistance. I attached photo to aid other poor souls trying to locate but I would avoid.,1
Use with caution,"Booked airport transfers via Suntransfers as prices were competitive. Received confirmation straight away via email. Arrived at Faro airport only to be hanging around as no driver was there to meet us (my Mum and I, Mum is a pensioner). Waited, then called customer service who were quite good and apologetic (although did have to keep 'pressing numbers' before being connected. They called the driver and called back to say that the driver was on his way.
When the driver arrived, no apology, didnt offer help with our cases until we were practically at the car. The customer service agent did call back again to ensure that we were picked up but the driver was awful. He was using a sat nav on his phone which kept redirecting so was obviously going his own way. Then he pulled into a petrol station, didnt say anything and went inside for a good few minutes. Then he came out and started filling his car!! He did eventually apologise when he got back in the car but the damage was already done at this point.
Longest half hour transfer ride ever, he kept driving too close to car in front on motorway.
Was so relieved when we got to our hotel.

For our return journey, called the company 2 HOURS before pick up to check all was ok as pick up was 8am. Were told all was fine, just before 8am, we waited outside the hotel hoping that we wouldnt get the same driver, 8am came and went and was just about to call up when a black van pulled up. Our transfer! A lady called Vanda, got out and apologised saying that her colleague who was due to take the job, called her last minute stating an issue with his car! (Whats the bet it was the same guy who came to the airport a few days earlier)! Vanda had to rush to us for the job. Vanda was lovely and gave us lots of info for when we book another trip. Vanda saved the day but overall, the experience was quite stressful.",2
Worst Experience Ever,"We reserved a shared transfer from Faro airport to Lagos for May 1 2023 through the SunTransfer website. Unbeknownst to us, our reservation ended up being subcontracted to a different local service, MTS. The voucher SunTransfer emailed us indicated we would be met in arrivals area by a driver with either ""SunTransfer "" or our names on a sign. Upon arrival, there was no one with such a sign although we searched the entire area for a half hour. We tried calling the SunTransfer number but our cell phone did not seem to be working (later found out it was a simcard problem). Eventually, a gentleman working with a different tour company noticed our plight and asked if we needed help. When we explained the situation, he told us to go to the MTS window because MTS sometimes works with SunTransfer. We went to the window and spoke to the woman working there, who clearly was not interested in listening to us. She glanced at our voucher, said SunTransfer staff should be waiting in front of the cafe, and turned her attention to the next customer, ignoring our protests that no one was there and we could not reach SunTransfers by phone. We headed to the airport information booth next, whose staff directed us to have the MTS rep call SunTransfers to resolve the situation. When we approached her again, the MTS rep continued to act as if our problem was unrelated to her and refused to call SunTransfers for us. She finally let us use her phone to call SunTransfers. We were able to reach SunTransfers on her phone and gave them our reservation information; they apologized for the situation and promised to call back shortly. While we waited nearby for the callback, the MTS rep unexpectedly approached us (apparently SunTransfers had called her back instead of us) and admitted that our reservation was indeed included

















on her list of reservations. However, she continued to deny all responsibility for the situation, saying that our voucher was in the wrong format. At this point we had spent close to an hour of panic running . She assured us that a driver was coming to take us and another family who would be dropped off first in Albufeira. After waiting another 15 minutes, the driver appeared. We asked how long it would take to get to Lagos, and he told us an hour and a half, since Albufeira was well out of the way. So in addition to enduring over an hour of unnecessary stress and maltreatment at the airport, we had to endure an hour and a half ride to Lagos, with no apology! I really feel we should have received our money back--have never seen customer service this poor in our lives!",1
You Can Do Better Yourself,"Last time I use Suntransfers. You’re better off scheduling a local service through your hotel. It’s absolutely ridiculous that this is a company. They simply have a service they call at the local market, pay in advance and then send a driver. They’re middlemen. They cannot guarantee no more reliability than if you called yourself and without the surcharge. The online chat doesn’t work. 24 hour response time is only for phone calls. Email responses are molasses slow.

You can do better.",2
Do not use these cowboys,"Booked a return transfer to and from our airport
Really annoyed that they were 40mins late to collect us from the airport but at least we were in the country.
No apologies driver did not care.
Could it get any worse? Unfortunately yes.
On the return leg they failed completely to turn up at our hotel to take us the the airport.
We tried phoning but no answer.
In the end we had to get a taxi to avoid missing our flight.
How can this be acceptable???
AVOID AVOID AVOID",1
Be aware deceptive!!!,We booked a private tour. ($350) the night before. When the driver came to pick us up we were informed most of the attractions were closed due to fire risk. This was known by the tour operator prior to our booking yet no mention made. No option to cancel in the morning at pick up either. The driver Sandro made the best of what was left to see. Upon inquiry the hotel said limits due to fire risk a common occurrence. This was very deceptive. Be aware prior to your booking.,1
Obliged to a private tutor with expenses borne by us for a lack thereof,"We did not participate in the tour because the tour operator stated that they had not received the booking. After more than 1 hour of waiting and trying to contact by phone, we manage to talk to the tour operator. As the only solution to their lack, he proposes to carry out the same tour but privately with a surcharge of €100. We accept because it is our last day in Lisbon and given the time it is also the only way not to waste the day altogether, but basically we had to pay for their mistake. In all this I asked for a refund of the difference of €100 that I had to incur from Viator who refunded me only about 25% of this amount without giving me any explanation. I would also add that the tour we did was done with a driver, not a guide, which is a totally different service.",1
Scam!!!!!,"The agency charges you for a non-refundable reservation when the owner of the property has already cancelled and delete the rental ad! This is what happened to me! I confirm the reservation and call the owner! Unfortunately no one answers and after many reminders of customer service! Really nothing! Real hustlers! Since January 2025 No refund So far! But then the property is still rented and other people fall into their trap! Be careful!!!!
To flee completely!",1
Driver and guide turned out to be driver only,Sintra full day with driver & guide was driver only. He did not educate us Just accompanied us to sites. No history education of sites or anything else. Didn’t even offer to take a pic of us when we were doing a selfie. Nice man and good driver but we paid for a guide too. How about less time on the phone? Complaint got us 10% refund totally unacceptable. Trip Advisor wanted pics as proof… a pic of someone driving & not talking or walking & not talking? Have used TA/Viator all over the world for years. Our 1st complaint.,1
Worst local tour experience.,"This is the worst local tour experience.
There is no one showed up for pickup.
Only number I got from the booking is going to voicemail.
No one contacted me and I waited at the lobby for an hour.
Bad bad bad.
Turn out they push the blame to the system. Speechless. Almost ruined my last day in Lisbon with wife for the valentine’s celebration.",1
"Great sites, poor tour","While the sites we saw were definitely worth visiting and worth the trip, the tour was lackluster. There was no agenda and no plan or options for lunch. We meandered for an hour at our first stop while having to wait for the correct times for our next stop. At one point, we had to wait 30-40 minutes while our tour guide had to charge his car. Which is a bit ridiculous, especially while we had just spend 1.5 hours on our own and he had plenty of time to charge.

In addition to that delay, the tour was supposed to be 8:30-2:30 and even though we left our hotel about 15 minutes early, we didn't get back until 4 with no lunch stops and had to adjust our afternoon plans.

We paid extra for 'Skip the Line' and our tour guide said that didn't get you anything and he needed to talk to the owners about that.",2
Sad,"plug a poorly trained, short-term, so-called guide into a car the guide doesn't know how to use for our private tour of Sintra. Insights? Less than what I could have read in a guide book. The guide was sincere in their efforts, but inexperienced. No, I would not use this service again or recommend it to anyone else.",2
BEWARE - Description is VERY misleading,"I use TripAdvisor and Viator frequently to select tours (30+ times). I have never been mislead and have had satisfaction with every selection to date ... until this SCAM tour.

In the itinerary/description, they list 9 sites to be visited. Later, after you book, they tell you will need to choose 3 of 6 monuments. What? not 3 of nine, buy 3 of six. ???

When I contacted the tour company days prior, and then again the night prior - communication was terrible. AND, the women stated that I would discuss my choices with the driver when he picked me up. When I discussed our itinerary with the driver/guide, he gave me excuses as to why it would be difficult to see certain places because of traffic, but we would try. HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY. He dropped us off and picked us up 3 hours later.

The result ... WE ONLY went to National Palace of Queluz for 5 minutes, Quinta da Regaleira (unguided) for an hour, spent 2 hours in town (unguided) and the Pena Palace. THAT IS IT.

When I confronted the drive/guide, he blamed Viator. He stated their description is wrong and a lot of customers complain. WHAT? I have never had an issue with Viator. And ... if the tour description is wrong, SWINGO should have it changed.

I chose to spend twice as much on this tour because of the comprehensive itinerary. I should have gone with a different tour company. YOU SHOULD GO WITH ANOTHER TOUR COMPANY.",1
Bad experience,"The visit basically didn't happen. We spent 3 hours in the car to see only the castle. The Guide did not warn us of the traffic, did not give us alternative solutions and also made us lose the tickets we had bought on his indication to see quarta de regaleira. We had no explanation regarding the city or the history. Basically we had a very nice driver but certainly not a Guide. Pretty much a wasted day!",1
Worst transfer experience,"Booked these airport transfers for clients travelling to Lisbon. For 8 adults we booked 2 vans, roundtrip.
Upon arrival, only one van was dispatched and no-one had any idea what they were talking about when they asked where their second van was.
The return transfer to the airport didnt show up at all. Called both their regular line, and their 'emergency' line and got no answer. No response to emails.

Absolutely do not recommend. Look elsewhere.",1
‼️ TO BE AVOIDED,"We booked, through GetYourGuide, a daily tour from Lisbon to Sintra-Cascais-Cabo da Roca managed by the agency Swingo by Avenidas.
At the place fixed for the appointment no one showed up!
We waited for an hour and called endless times, empty.
GetYourGuide also tried to contact Swingo without receiving a response. So we had to start the procedure for the refund... day spoiled because of Swingo: SCONSIGLIATISSIMI!",1
Deplorable customer service,"Well, as long as you don’t need help because of an administrative error. It is very difficult to contact them and almost impossible to get an answer and help from them. A very incompetent Customer Service who obviously does not know the travel environment. After a fifth unsuccessful attempt to obtain a flight reservation number recognized by the airline, the person from the private travel customer service masked his incompetence by submitting a false request for assistance. We have just received a message regarding a so-called request to modify the bedding.... Nothing to do with our case. And this after receiving an email giving the booking codes of another unknown family for an airline just as foreign to our file. This is absolutely ridiculous! Customer service above all!!",2
"Sweet guide, but not a tour","Our guide was very sweet, but provided almost no information on anywhere we visited or passed by. We had almost no plan whatsoever, showing up to the first castle an hour before they opened with no plan to fill the time. Came across as very organized and was a glorified taxi to some of Sintra’s attractions.",2
Just a driver - not a tour guide,"This tour fell short of my expectations. I won’t identify the driver because there were no issues with him, but I emphasize that he is just a driver: this isn’t really a tour, you’re essentially paying to have someone drive you from place to place. It’s nice to be able to customize an itinerary that suits you, but we expected that there might be a bit more of a guided tour involved. Instead, the driver stays in the car and is unable to enter any of the palaces or monuments, so you’ll see other tours with guides who explain history to the attendees, but we didn’t have that. Would’ve been nice for the price we were paying.

We also found the tour company to be disorganized. We had to reach out to them the night before, as we hadn’t heard anything other than a generic confirmation upon booking. When we called, they put us in touch with the wrong driver. They also didn’t inform us that we needed to book any tickets in advance—it ended up being fine but you should book Pena Palace in advance and ideally get an early time slot, which wouldn’t have been communicated to us had we not reached out ourselves. Overall, a bit frustrating.",2
Not good,"I booked a transfer with Swingo from the Lisbon airport to my hotel on Sep 29. I received a text in advance from Swingo giving me my driver's name and phone #. When I arrived on time at the airport, I went to the designated meeting point, but couldn't find the driver, so I called the driver's phone and left a message. Swingo had changed drivers without notifying me, so the new driver didn't get my call. The new driver showed up after a few minutes wearing a tee shirt. Didn't expect a coat and tie but feel he should've been better dressed for a private car. Then the driver couldn't find my hotel - he was using a phone GPS and it was obvious he didn't know Lisbon. I could tell we were close according to the GPS on my phone and was tired of going around the block, so I asked him to let me off. We were 1/2 block away from my hotel. I feel I could've had a better experience with a taxi or Uber at a much lower cost.",2
"Unfortunately, a No Show","Actually, the driver never showed up. We had an overnight flight from the US, and arrived after 5:30 am. The driver never showed and the local contact had no after hours number and did not open until 8 am. We finally ended up taking a taxi at 8:30 when our driver was not reachable. I hope nothing happened to the driver... but plan if you book something outside of business hours, you need to get an emergency number, just in case.",1
Taxi scam at Lisbon Airport,So we waited in the line(que) for the taxi manager to direct us to a airport taxi the black and green ones. I had asked about the cost to cascais he said it was metered so could not give an estimate. We got in the cab and was totally distracted initially by the sights and speed of traffic. It was when we got into our trip I noticed the meter was not on and turned facing in . When we landed in cascais the driver who was obviously had scammed us charged us a flat rate of $64 and showed me the flat rate guide he had conveniently tucked up in the visor. So traveller beware make sure the meter is on or better still use Uber / Bolt located in the departure area.,1
Forget the address,"Attention: This review refers to a trip I made with my wife in April 2017 to Lisbon and Queluz to review the cities, not December 2023. I didn't have the option of putting the right date.

As a cigar lover and author of the only book originally written in Portuguese on the subject, I made a list of places I wanted to visit in advance. I already knew of the incomprehensible prohibition of taking pictures of the place. I was holding my cell phone in hand, as I used to stand to receive messages, and the rude gentleman behind the counter said, ""He's taking pictures! You can't!"" I didn't say I didn't even try to photograph. I got very upset with the stupid attitude of the citizen and we left the store. The man was still after us saying ""Go back to Brazil!"" If you are Brazilian, look for Casa Havaneza, it is another level of service. Let's leave the unbalanced Tabacaria Monaco serving the ghosts of the clientele of the past.",1
Creed!,"A dangerous thing to drive, I would crash several times along the way! Narrow streets and it tucks into the sidewalk, almost hitting people. Very disturbing",1

Disappointing,"We paid a fortune for a luxury yacht cruise. We got the power catamaran for 4 a hour tour. What they gave us was a 2 hour cruise but just drove the boat very very slowly. Additionally, the power catamaran has no comfortable outdoor seating. We could have say inside but for the outside seating there was only a railing surrounding all out door benches. They made no effort to actually give us what we paid for. The Captain Phillippe could not have been nicer but that does not excuse the misrepresentation of this catamaran being anything remotely resembling luxury. It was barebones not luxury. They should have just told us that they do not really have a 4 hour tour and that they should have just said we only have 2 hour cruise and not to drive the boat at an average of 3 knots around the harbor. F0r the 4 hours we paid 1200 pounds and it was simply not worth it - having nothing to do with the captain or his crew - they were very nice. I regret the extra 2 hours I spent of my vacation on this cruise.",2
"Terrible experience. Did not get on board because of wheelchair users, although they have separated with “priority boarding”.","It's terrible! They have signs that show that it is priority boarding as wheelchair users, but when we get there as a follow of 9 in the family, the wheelchair user does not let on the boat. They also refuse to refund the ticket. This despite the fact that also getyourguide that we booked through, has suggested this activity as a wheelchair-friendly activity in Lisbon. We feel discriminated and humiliated. There was no service arrangement from the company to help us with this, they only refused us to get the tickets we had paid for, since we had a wheelchair user with us, and that he was not allowed to board in principle.",1
Bad experience,"The experience could have been pleasant if it weren't for the lack of character, transparency and friendliness on the part of the staff, particularly Francisco.",1
Lack of professionalism,"Something not to repeat!
Despite the welcoming view, the poor disposition and lack of versatility of the staff was the biggest cause of nausea.
For me, they were going sailing!",1
We expected better service,"We didn't really like the fact that they promised us that the trip could last for another half hour but then the people who went with us threw sand in our faces saying that it couldn't be done because of the maritime police.
They also didn't give us the crackers that had been promised and we had to ask for drinks.
Overall, we liked the experience but we didn't like the relationship with the drivers who came with us on the boat, as well as some outings that one of them had.",2
Walking Tour with Jessica in Lisbon - Could have been better,"We did our walking tour in Lisbon with Jessica. Am afraid the tour wasn’t quite great. One expects such walking tours to be engaging, insightful and a little funny. This was mostly one-way communication. The local recommendations were nice, but otherwise we felt the tour didn’t do justice to the beautiful city that Lisbon is.",2
Rubbish,The guide although enthusiastic was not great and really could have a whole lot better. Never again don’t recommend to anyone,1
38 people and seemed very similar to Rick Steves audio tour but less info,"This was a very disappointing experience. There were way too many people on this trip counted them twice and it was 38. There were a few stops on the walk where we went off and then came back to the guide, as you can imagine with 38 people this took time. In the afternoon we decided to follow the Rick Steves audio tour we had downloaded and tour surprise it went to the same places and had a lot more information. My recommendation is to download FREE Rick Steves audio guide that also has a map and the text of the audio and do that, remember these walking tours are not free, the Rick Steves audio is and in our opinion, had a lot more information and we weren’t with 36 others. Photo is showing only part of the group. There were a number of people behind us when I took this photo.",2
Take Lisboa tour a no show,"We confirmed from three sources that we were at the pickup site. We were there 10
minutes early and waited until 30 minutes after the pickup time. While many other tour busses stopped, nothing from Take Lisboa. Very disappointed.",1
They forgot Saramago,"I was thrilled to find the José Saramago Nobel Prize in literature Foundation, very close to where I stayed and to know the tree where his ashes are located. There is nothing to add about the figure of this character, recognized worldwide, so I was surprised that in the tour of his red truck (which charges) through which the traveler can tour the most prominent sites, there was not a single mention of the novelist. Unexplained and unforgivable. I sent an email to the Lisbon tourism department and received no reply.",2
Customer Distraction,"I arrived 10 minutes late for the 10:30 am tour and, when I called support to join, the attention was very rude: they offered no alternative or meeting point and called me “irrational”. Fortunately, on the 11:00 h tour the guide Javiera was excellent, very attentive and friendly, and had no problem joining me explaining everything clearly. My negative vote is for the poor treatment of the company support, which clearly does not take care of its customers.",1
Guide not very understandable and not very interesting for us,"Reservation made that same morning on the internet very simple and we found the guide without problem.
We had the guide Bruno although very friendly, it was difficult to understand in French. And what little we understood was of little interest to us: We left the tour in the middle after leaving a tip.",2
The Rafa guide is TOTALLY EXPENDABLE. A SCAM because we wasted our time.,The Rafa guide did not fulfill the agreed itinerary and not even an alternative one: walk and stop to sit and smoke. A lot of scholarship and little basis. I felt obligated to PAY as he asked me exactly that ONE PAYMENT.,1
A simple walk,"Bruno, our guide, walked us for 2 hours in the Alfama district. We had very little information. Luckily the neighborhood is superb. This made the walk fun but it was by no means a guided tour",2
Worst experience ever,Awful experience and would never use again! I booked a group of 6 for a FREE tour of Lisbon and a friend of mine booked for a group of 4. Unknown to us there is a policy around groups of 7 or more so when we have our names to the tour guides they wanted to charge us €10 per person because we were all together even though we booked separately. How can this be? They quoted something about the quality of the tour if there are big groups so what difference would it have made being all together in amongst everyone else? Absolutely shocking customer service. Tip - if this is you don’t tell the guides you are together!!! 😡😡😡😡,1
Very loose tour with zero recommendations,"Loose Aranzazu tour, with a huge group of people which made explanations difficult. He took us through the places that appear in the guides and counted the texts that appear in the guides. Nothing you can't read online. Also very dedicated to people tipping more than telling curiosities. It is a shame because according to her she had been living in Lisbon “for many years”.
He did not give recommendations individually and only provided a document that he sent on WhatsApp at the end of the tour and after waiting for people to contribute the tip.
Very mercantilist",2
I don't recommend them.,When the guide arrived he saw us talking to another group of people from our country. He assumed we were forming a group and refused to join the tour. We explained we weren't together and he refused. The bookings of one of the groups were made two weeks in advance and ours were made directly with one of the guides. We were told liars. Disrespectful.,1
I would change guides,"Beautiful visit and prepared guide, but becomes unfashioned as soon as you make a joke .. Then people like that also expect a tip at the end of the tour.. Bha...",1
Free Tour Jose,"The overall tour has been a bit awkward. We asked him questions during the tour and apart from not answering it seemed to bother him.
We have gone to the “typical” restaurants he has recommended and the nefarious experience.... all very expensive and not worth it at all. We had to leave the restaurant how unpleasant the food was.

I'm so sorry to post this rating and comment, but I don't like being treated like I'm not.

I want to stress that Jose has always, even before we started, made it clear that we had to be respectful of his work, including that we had to pay, when he has not been.",1
Lisbon tour,We were a few minutes late and the tour was not there when we arrived. Waste of 7$. A disappointing experience. I understand that we were late but curios to why no grace time,1
Disappointed,"Great disappointment! We came to the meeting place early in the morning to learn that the visit in French was cancelled or not scheduled. We didn’t even understand.
We're waiting for the refund",1
Don’t do free tour with Lili,"The city is nice, but the free tour is lousy gave us the Freeman tour LILI which was dedicated 90% to recommend restaurants and Free tours of friends of them for your benefit, it is a total scam!!",1
Tour Alfama,"My experience with Rafa was not so positive. While his colleagues were friendly and professional, he adopted an attitude that generated discomfort, making us feel ignorant and sharing personal and political opinions that diverted attention from the tour. I believe that a more focused approach to academic content would be more beneficial to all. I pray to God heartily that Rafa fulfills his dreams as a painter and stops bittering the holidays of tourists.",1
Weren't allowed to go on the tour,"We didn't even get to do the tour. My group showed up with some other groups that reserved separately, we are all family but reserved separately. The tour guide informed us that since we were friends/family the tour would cost €10 per person prior to the start of the tour, despite having separate reservations, or we could not go. We were not informed about this prior to the tour date. Later we saw a message on tripadvisor only 2 hours before the tour telling us the same thing. This is totally misleading and seems to be a way to get everyone to pay despite promoting the tour as free. Very disappointed.",1
Dire,"Dire
They won't let us join the tour because we made two reservations
Don't hire them.
First impression of Lisbon very negative because of companies like this",1
Very unpleasant!,"I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS AGENCY AT ALL. The guides Dani and Elena treated us terrible!!! Just to say we were 7 people, with two different reservations!!! Never happened to us before.",1
Fatal,"After seeing a good review, the kid got aggressive to yell telling me what a tough face for not giving him money. I went to answer him and he was yelling at me. I think the tour to start with is free, I don't have to pay anyone if I don't want to or can't. He's left me with a bad body for yelling at me like that, and there's so many people. I don't want to tour with this rude character again. Awful.",1
"Tour without relevant city information, recommendations only","We did the free tour of the center with Liliana. Nearly three hours of tour in which he gave little relevant information about the city or its history. Almost 80% of the time was spent recommending where to eat, where to drink and recommending other tours that she offers. In fact he spent a good time explaining how to get around Sintra when many of us who were present said we were not going to visit him. It doesn’t make any sense for you to dedicate a tour of downtown Lisbon to talking about how to manage a visit elsewhere. It gave us the feeling that he treated us like the tourist of the topic. The one who just wants to know where to eat. It is very good to recommend restaurants etc but not spend so much time on it. It gave us the feeling that I really didn't know what to talk about the city and its history. We also consider that he spent too much time explaining how a free tour guide works and the importance of reviews when there was NO ONE in the group who hadn’t done a free tour before. It's okay for me to explain, but not so many times or so long. I have done quite a few free tours and this was probably the worst I have ever done.",1
Guide dependent,"Sorry but this was rather a tired tour and probably got more kickbacks for the guide than information for any of the group. If someone is flagging with the hills then wait until they arrive before pointing anything out would be more thoughtful.
Not the biggest group so perhaps explains his lack of much information.
The stops at the cake shop and Ginjinha (both excellent) were justifiable to perhaps earn him something extra but the wine nonsense at the end in a friends bar where it was a tasting with (oh I forgot to tell you it’s 4 euros a glass of very average wine - after pouring umpteen glasses) was pretty blatant. We’ve done these tours in various cities and this was lowest on the scale unfortunately. Rather awkward and I think the guide sensed that but didn’t really care.",2
Disappointing,"A tour should serve to know a little more the history of the place, the culture and traditions of its people and their day to day. At the moment that a guide dedicates himself to politicizing the tour itself, manipulating the minds of people, as well as the true history of a place, something fails. To say barbarities, such as that the pictures of Alfama’s own neighbors on every corner are a lie, is flatly false. They are a tribute to the people who lived in the neighborhood and who have mostly died and that it was a work carried out by an American neighbor of the neighborhood. To say that the dictator Salazar built the castle of Saint George is equally false. It was rebuilt in the 1940s, not built. To say that tourists are the worst thing for the residents of Alfama because they disturb the latter, is not true. Tourists stroll its streets, sometimes talking to their neighbors. To say that the only thing that interests tourists is the center, which, has no interest whatsoever is false. Tourists are interested in neighborhoods other than Baixa, such as Alfama, Mouraria, Bairro Alto, Belém...
Finally, it is not normal to leave the tour on several occasions to talk to neighbors. We found a perfectly orchestrated theater to give an unrealistic image of the neighborhood itself. Everyone's political ideas, better at the ballot box, not on a tour.
In short, the tour was an absolute manipulation by Rafa, our guide.",2
Doesn't make up for the tour,"One hour left over from the tour. It seems like a school outing with a stop to buy Belen cakes and time to take pictures, both activities take away my lot of time and it is something that everyone can do whenever they want before or after starting. The information provided is very basic.",1
Nefarious guide,"The visit has been horrible, the guide has had a chaotic speech, with many stops and has not focused on showing us the neighborhood of Belem. I have had the feeling of losing a whole morning of the 3 days we are in Lisbon. Too much history and little to see, for this I put a documentary",1
For education to the Guide and the tour companions do not leave it. But I thought I was wasting time in several o'clock,"Tour with very little relevant information, too long stops and too many comments that did not come with the visit. I think the center of Lisbon has more and offers more than the Guide offered us.",2
Frustration,"Hiked down from my ""hotel"" at the top of Bairro Alto, wandered a bit, but arrived at the stroke of 4 at rendezvous point. Saw no sign of ""blue umbrellas"". Hiked back up hill.",1
Rude guide. Disappointing. AVOID,"I booked this tour for myself and my family (4 of us). Other members of my family then said that they would also like to attend so I booked 3 more tickets. When we arrived at the meeting point, the guide rudely told us that she could not let us do the tour as we were a group of 7 and it would be classed as a private tour. I told her we had already paid and had separate bookings. Again, very rudely she said that we could only go if we paid her 10 euros each. We walked away. My family included 3 people over 80 years old who had walked from the port to get to this tour in time for the meeting time do we were not at all happy when we were told we couldn’t do it. I would recommend you avoid this. I’m 100% sure that there are better tours with more friendly guides.",1
A lost afternoon in Lisbon,"A lost afternoon in Lisbon, this is how I define my experience on this Free Tour.
We did not plan to do this tour but a Guide of the first day recommended them, told us to know the neighborhood, that we would see water gushing from the stones, we would see the best views of the city and that we would live an experience in the unique neighborhood.
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
The Guide has already started badly, he arrived with a cigar, without speaker and with a dim voice, he told us to enter the museum of José Saramago and there he would explain in Tour and some more things. The explanation was not bad, it indicated a little the origins of the neighborhood and the age of the city, this was all we did from what we hired.
Once we left the museum came chaos. He was standing in the closed houses to see the arches of the portals, we arrived at the Cathedral trying to explain something and we didn’t understand anything, we entered the neighborhood of Alfama and he was stopping to talk to the neighbors leaving the group cut in “explanations”, we entered to courtyards to not get to explain anything clear, we entered the neighborhood and he kept talking with neighbors and passersby, in short, an experience that has nothing to do with the reserved.

Already indicated that it would be a slightly out of the ordinary experience, I understand it since everyone approaches their work as they want, what I don’t understand is that they offer this experience as a Tour of Alfama, when they should offer it as an experience like “Tour of Rafa the Galician” or something and not take people has been wrong, saving you from losing one afternoon the 3 days that are in Lisbon.

Money is optional, but time lost is not recovered by anyone.",1
Alphama neighborhood,"I didn't like it at all, our guide was Rafa, 3 hours and a half tour where I saw nothing. No comment. We only had this day to meet and we wasted our time.",1
"FREE TOUR, REALLY????","Some of the guides are good, some are not. Who cares? What is matter for a Take A Free tour is to collect the passive income through the guides!

Every client has a cost of 4€ for the guide!

So next time, you book a free tour, make sure to pay the guides with a minimum of 10€

Free tour industry is shameful, a great example of what is neocapitalism!",1
Route visits neighborhood Alfama responsible Rafa only interested in us giving you good references to continue having ensures,"Visit the neighborhood of Alfama curious and helps to know better the situation of the country as well as the history, it is worth doing",1
A bad experience,"We have done the tour with José and the truth that leaves much to be desired. I explain almost nothing about the neighborhood. On the contrary, he complained on several occasions about the economy, tourism in Lisbon... Etc
From the first moment I explain what he pays for each person who will do the tour (data that in our review is irrelevant since he is doing a job).
At one point in the tour we wanted to leave as I had made several comments which were out of order. He followed us in the middle of the tour to demand fair remuneration which we felt he did not deserve. We explained politely what we thought and since our review did not like it, he verbally assaulted us.
It wasn't a pleasant experience at all.",1
Not to repeat,"Guía Rafa. Worst tour I've ever done in European cities. The Guide was improvising, talking about his stories. He didn't explain any history. We haven't been to places in the neighborhood because he wasn't interested. Tedious, politicized, and graceless. I left the neighborhood without hearing from him because his Guide has not explained anything but his life in the neighborhood.",1
Not to be repeated,"As prepared as Antonella was, it was hard to keep up ... the tour was mainly based on Portuguese lessons, notions about food and spam from other tours ... little history and few notions (some of which were at odds with what other guides had previously explained to us)",1
Not suitable for Catholics,"I had never hired a free tour and recommend the experience. I already knew Lisbon, but I discovered things I didn't know. Moreover, with Diego, one “enjoys” a political, moral and religious sermon, neither requested nor necessary, and charged with deep sectarianism.
You have to recognize the courage – or ignorance – of believing yourself in a position of moral superiority and supremacism when your income depends on those who come to your rally involuntarily. Obviously, the political harangue was discounted in the payment.
By the way, the Catholic Kings did much more than kill Jews and Muslims. Nothing worse than a graceless funnyman who thinks it's humorous to constantly disrespect those who don't think like him",1
Diego lousy guide,"Super bad the guide diego, said it lasted 2 1/2 hours and lasted no more than 1 hour 30. He didn't remember where to go, he didn't remember what he said, super improvised. I did at least 10 or 15 tours in these last 2 weeks and loved the guides all! But this one was lousy. A pity because alphama is beautiful but with a bad guide, it ruins everything. I don't know if yesterday was Saturday and went to party but it was terrible.",1
Very disappointed,We arrived 20 minutes early. Checked with those who worked nearby. Yes we were told this was the right spot. No one showed up. No one shot us a message that the tour was cancelled. Not cool,1
None from none.,"None from none.
I did not make the visit.
In fact I had booked in French.
When I arrived there the tour was in Italian.
So I don't have any",1
Melanie great guide!,"We arrived at the meeting point and Mélanie, who we had had in the morning for the essential Lisbon visit, told us that the group was going to be split in two and that we were going to be with Antonella. Antonella and right next to Melanie and doesn't look up from her phone or greet us. No response to our “hello”. Before being offended by her rudeness I ask Mélanie if she is indeed French. Antonella then takes two steps towards me and responds very aggressively ""if I didn't speak French would I offer tours in French?!!"". Faced with such aggression, I asked Mélanie to change groups. Mélanie accepts and takes us with her. We are delighted! Melanie is awesome!! I recommend it 100%!! And I strongly advise against Antonella. Mélanie is friendly, very interesting, the timbre of her voice is pleasant. She is very cheerful and despite her experience and the rhythm of the guided tours that follow one another, she does not make us feel tired and responds very pleasantly to our questions. The rhythm is perfect. Not too fast and not too soft. She's great, try asking her for your turn, you won't be disappointed.",1
Last minute cancellation of the visit,We had organized our 4-day trip with a whole program made in advance to optimize the time. The visit was canceled less than 3 hours before even though we had organized our day according to the appointment made for this visit. Very disappointed,1
Guide Never Showed,"I guess he/she had something better to do. We waited at the designated time and place looking for a blue umbrella to no avail. Pretty wicked climb to get to the meeting place, as well.",1
"Weird situation with the guide, decided to leave","The guide Araceli started the tour offering unnecessary, private details of her contract with Take & Civitatis, as well as indicating that one HAD to pay at the end of the tour (we always had contributed in the many walking tours we've done over the years). She also said that the contribution was later split among 3 guides, suggesting that we had to be ""generous"". What an awkward situation! She finally started the tour, explanations were bland. We decided to leave (first time ever!) and do some walking on our own.",1
Improvable,"The tour was very nice, but the guide Fernanda was average. It finished in exactly two hours and could explain something else...",2
Guide Juan's jokes out of place,"The guide I had (Juan) made a joke when he explained the massacre against the Jews that was not good... ""Also whoever thinks of it"" he said when he explained that a Jew had denied that Jesus was there and said that it was just a shadow and they killed him for it.
You have to be more tactful with these things.
There were other jokes that were also out of place.",2
No show,No show at pick up site. Not good. I would skip this due to no show. It is a free show and you just pay them as you see fit. No motivation to show up.,1
"We walked, listened to stories, ate, took photos, enjoyed, laughed, shared, beautiful group","Yerlin gave us a beautiful tour, we will surely repeat it on another tour. He explained every detail of the city to us, recommended where to eat and everything with great friendliness.",1
"Sintra, Uncomfortable","The views were impressive and we loved the history of Sintra, very exciting and striking.
We did the tour with Kike and we would not recommend him as a guide. He has a lot of historical knowledge but blurs it with his ways. Instead of giving us a friendly welcome, he was very rude in responding to whether he was the guide, whether that was the place... continuing with the eternal explanation of what he earns and inviting people who did not agree with what he said to leave to leave. agreed"", emphasizing that it is not mandatory to stay. We consider that it is not the best way to join a group or start a tour.
We value Virginia Checa and Juan who guided us in Famma and Lisboa Centro.
If you come across as rough and direct, don't expect recommendations. It is just our opinion of tourists and experiences with freetour.",1
Our experience,"Diego, our guide, spent the visit cross-selling, in our opinion, more concerned about how much he was going to charge than about being a guide.
3 years ago I did that same tour and it was totally different.
It is true that there were people who seemed to like the visit very much.",1
Highly recommended!,"The tour is great, the history of the places was explained very well.
The views where they take you are amazing
Highly recommended",1
A free tour with an experience that is not at all “Marian”,"The tour started 20 minutes late, and although we asked him why the delay was, he answered: “loves, relax and breathe, you are on vacation,” with a tone that was far from the respect expected of a guide, the first lack of respect from some of the tour. The next thing, when we left almost half an hour late due to waiting for a family, she brought in 5 more people, which, together with the fact that she didn't have a microphone, made it very difficult to hear her on some occasions. Every time you asked him something his response was: “relax, loves, you are on vacation.” As for what the tour is, I would have appreciated more information and history of Alfama and less political discourse on the housing problem in Lisbon. I don't think I've ever suffered a lack of respect on a free tour and it's clear that with Mariana I wouldn't do it again. To say that I only did it because in theory it was done by Gabriela Londoño who showed that she had more education and respect for the people who spend their time in this city and who encouraged me to do more tours with the company.",2
No sign of tour guide or tour party,"Can only describe this as a ‘missable tour’, I arrived at the designated starting point in good time (9.50am, 3 October) and looked out for a person carrying an umbrella as shown in the photo but it turned out that the tour had commenced without me. I went on a great walking tour with a competitor instead. Please spend my booking fee wisely!",1
Much improvement,"It feels like we could have seen a lot more of Lisbon in two and a half hours. Our guide Clara has explained a lot of history, but more visits and recommendations have been missing.",2
Wonderful,"Natalia told us a lot of history, anecdotes in a passionate and exciting way.
He gave us many practical tips to get around Lisbon and enjoy it.",1
Disappointment,"More than a tour, it was a walk with someone local around Lisbon or a gastronomy guide. I'm not talking about anything you can't look up on the internet and read.",2
The tour that time forgot,"Never got to ho on the your Mx meeting addresses with same address . Could never find the group or guide . No number to call or reach for assistance. Bern on countless tours in Mx countries …., FAIL",1
Alfama,"As much as the guide Elisa is prepared and knows Alfana's soul, we didn't feel it and it was a boring tour. Too many mythical tales, and little history of Alfama, as it was and now as it is",1
I would repeat again,"Dani made our visit super entertaining.
Great for a first impression of the city.
Lots of tips and recommendations.",1
"Bad experience, waste of time ☹️","Free tour - Lisbon
We have done quite a few free tours through different cities and, honestly, I expected much more from this one. Our guide has been Juan; The tour started more than half an hour after the appointment time (ok for organizational reasons), chaotic explanations that jumped from data to data, without much sense or linearity and a couple of stops in bars in the middle of the tour. Honestly, it seemed like a waste of my time and I didn't leave out of shame, just as we gave him €10 because we were more embarrassed not to pay him anything, which is what the activity deserved. The worst thing is the feeling of loss of time for a few days that we are going to be in the city.",1
Lousy,"Today we did the Sintra tour with the guide Juan and it was a disaster! We went from one place to another like headless turkeys, he seemed to have nothing prepared and stop wherever he thought of unexpectedly. The same thing he told us that we were going to a place and then he changed his mind and we didn't go. The explanation without contributing anything, a lot of names of flowers and philosophy but nothing interesting. Talk about your life and little else. Other colleagues were heard saying very interesting things. And on top of that, coercing us to give 5 stars in the review so that he could tell us where to eat. Anyway, a shame because the place deserved much more.",1
Very disappointing visit,"Very disappointing visit, very little information on the history of Lisbon, too few visits to monuments... on the other hand useless information and visits: the bra bar, where to find cheap beers... And unfortunately our guide had poor command of French and was difficult to understand, our children, usually very interested in history and guided tours, understood nothing, and dropped out after 5 minutes. A waste of time and money for us...",2
Very nice,"The views have been very beautiful and Javiera has explained everything to us in detail, we have walked a lot but it was worth it.",2
Pésima Gestión,"Pedro el guía de Belén no nos dejó participar en la actividad ya que se inventó que al se dos familias conocidas nos indicó que teníamos que hacer reserva de grupo, cosa que Civitatis en ningún momento nos indicó y nos permitió reservar sin problemas. Desde la oficina no nos dieron ninguna solución lo que nos trastoca todos los planes de la mañana. EVITEN ESTE EMPRESA SI NO QUIEREN PROBLEMAS DE ULTIMA HORA. ATENCION @CIVITATIS ESTA EMPRESA INCITA A LOS PARTICIPANTES A CANCELAR LA RESERVA CON Civitatis PARA HACERLA DIRECTAMENTE CON ELLOS Y PAGAR MENOS COMISIÓN.",1
Dissappointing guide,"We were a little bit disappointed with Eduardo. Although he knew enough history and stories about Lisbon, he wasn't very passionate or enthousiastic. As non-native English speakers, we couldn't understand everything. He stopped close to the building (not a good view) and in the sun (even when there was shadow a couple of meters away). He kept complaining we took too long to take photos or to go to the toilet. We've had better guides in other cities.",2
Too Large/Difficult to Find,"These tours are jus too large. Our group was 35+ people. The guide was very difficult to understand. Also, our group was very difficult to find in the plaza because there are A LOT of tour groups meeting there and our guide did not have his umbrella. Also we were told to find a blue umbrella and there were many blue umbrellas. I would suggest just paying for a tour...much better service and smaller group. We tried the free tour in Porto as well and it was the same problem. His umbrella wasn't even the correct color and again, so many groups and so large. Very, very disappointed. Next time we will just book a paid tour with a small group of people.",1
Harry Potter tour...underwhelming,"I booked the free Harry Potter tour in Porto and I was super excited about it. Unfortunately, it was pretty lackluster and the tour guide didn't seem as engaged as I hoped. He also spent a good amount of time getting to know the other female members of the tour and barely engaged with me and my husband. He was nice and all but of all the tour guides I've completed, this was underwhelming. This is supposed to be the same tour that was created by someone who now charges for it on Airbnb or Tripadvisor. Maybe if I paid for an HP tour, it would've been better.",2
Jewish tourism deserves much betterer,"Worst Viator experience we've ever had. Synagogue visit was informative. The guide was engaging and knowledgeable about the Lisbon Jewish community. The next 2 hours were useless. No real information was given, just conjecture and misinformation about Jews and their impact on Portugal and the world. We didn't see any other Jewish sites. We walked thru a China shop and used the bathroom in a hotel, being told not to touch anything. Tour guide spoke negatively about the changes in Lisbon due to tourism and immigrants.",1
"More wine, more wineries, stop for lunch please","I might recommend this for a group that is new to wine and intimidated by the wine-tasting experience, as the guide simplifies and demystifies wine. For anyone who knows and is interested in wine, you will not find the reductive explanations uninteresting. He claims that all wine makers do exactly the same thing and that it’s just chemistry. He says there is no difference between an expensive wine and an inexpensive wine except storage time and marketing. What about the yield of the vines, the selection of the grapes, and the many choices the winemaker makes? It’s nice to be chauffeured to tastings, but the pours are so small you could have driven (except that it’s illegal to drive in Portugal with any measurable amount of alcohol in your blood). The guide discouraged us from buying lunch and just to eat the cheese and charcuterie, but it comes rather late in the tour so be sure to eat a hearty breakfast. The last stop is not a winery but a wine store. I recommend a Douro Valley wine tour from Porto instead.",2
"Decent tour, unfortunate refund policy","Nice tour and we liked our guide Vasco, very nice and knowledgeable on wine. One of the wineries was very old and had a great tour guide. Would be nice if they included lunch with the tour. Our biggest issue is that our child got sick so one of the three of us had to cancel the day before. Because it wasn't 24 hours (even though it was the day before), they wouldn't offer even a partial refund (even though 2 of us still went on the tour). Bad enough to have to miss the tour to take care of a sick child, to then have to pay 100 euros for nothing on top of it. In contrast, we didn't have to pay for a trip we took to Sintra through Portugal Unknown until the day of. Should consider a policy that allows for extenuating circumstances.",2
"To flee, driver never arrived!","The Talixo driver never showed up at our Pension. He did not answer our multiple calls. However, I had received a text that morning confirming the pick-up, with the driver’s name. I don't understand Booking.com working with these people. Booking reimbursed us for the ride and also paid for the taxi we took in a disaster so as not to miss our plane in Lisbon. However, not the slightest commercial gesture of Booking.com. In short, if you notice that Booking subcontracts with Talixo, cancel!",1
Company not recommended,"Instead of picking us up at the airport at 12:30 p.m., the driver arrived at 1:30 p.m. and returned from the hotel to the airport at 6 a.m. no taxi. After calling the driver at 6:12 a.m., he told us I'll come in 20 minutes. So look for another taxi so as not to miss the plane.
Really not correct.",1
Bad experience,"We hired a transfer with Talixo through Booking from Lisbon airport to the city. We arrived with the flight on time and without checking in, and upon arrival we had to wait 50 minutes for the driver to arrive. Don't even think about it, terrible organization and waste of time and money.",1
Stay away.,We received our driver information and called him at the pickup time because we did not see him. No answer… we reached out to chat support who took a few minutes to reply and said that they would reach the driver and to wait 5 minutes. There were about 12 names on the board but no one holding a sign. 35 minutes later some guy comes and asks if I’m there. I explain yes we’ve been here and he proceeded to yell at me and tell me I was not there waiting. He then had us follow him through the parking lot to put us in a random bolt that was waiting for a fare. The man in charge was incredibly unprofessional. The driver we were assigned did not end up taking us as they instead put us in a small bolt with all of our luggage. Would not recommend.,1
They are not worth the money :-(,"Was neither delivered nor picked up at the address we wanted, so we recommend that you use the metro/Bus, we were not informed that they could not deliver the service we were looking for, on collection at the airport they came with a car where there was none space for our luggage.",1
The worst,"Another company made by a tech bro that is utterly bad.

Reviews everywhere are awful. I now arrived and they tell me the driver supposed to pick me up is doing another run. If I book a cab that is very expensive I expect that the driver is waiting for me.",1
"talixo doesnt worth a penny, they dont refund and don´t do their job","The worst service ever. You hired them, they get your money, the don´t show up and don´t refund you. It looks like that ´s their way of working. They fool people , that´s what they do best. If you ever consider to hire them, don´t do it. I have been reading messagens and comments on the internet about their lack of compromise and manners of getting people´s money, it´s not only my money they have been getting. So, Run away from them.",1
Appalling Lack of Service,"This company is a complete sham and should be avoided at all costs!
We waited almost an hour for a previously booked and paid for premium collection by Mercedes Vito which did not arrive at all! No answer from the driver number or the emergency contact number provided. A lady who took our details at the meeting point in the airport waited with us and eventually put us in a normal taxi because that is all she could get for us!

The same driver was booked for return, and was due to arrive at 7am. At 7:10 I rang the driver number and he answered after a while, did not apologise and just said he would be another 10 minutes which would then make him 20 minutes late. When he did eventually arrive, I complained that he had kept us waiting outside the hotel for all that time but he made no attempt to apologise, just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't understand English.",1
Worse tha appalling,"This is the most appalling and deceitful company I have encountered. No taxi waiting at the airport despite all the text messages confirming there would be. We were asked to wait 10 mins, then a further 15 mins then a further 25 mins at which point we lost patience. The rep at the airport is rude and unhelpful and blatantly lies. The hotline help number is useless as no one answers. The return journey was no better, the driver just didn’t turn up despite a text message stating he was a few minutes away resulting in us almost missing our flight. Avoid at all costs.",1
Total disappointment -2.255878,"Space completely abandoned.
Bad treated. Blurred roads. Shiny houses, broken windows. It wasn't worth the ride.
Disappointment.",2
O abandono total,"Um jardim que supostamente está sob alçada da freguesia da Estrela e está num abandono completo. São 10 hectares de jardim, passeios, equipamentos e edifícios fantásticos completamente desfeitos.
Não é com certeza parte do circuito turístico mas ainda assim há muita gente a tentar desfrutar deste espaço.",1
Very Disappointing for a “Premium” Lounge,"The space felt overcrowded and noisy, with very limited seating available. The food selection was poor and lacked variety — most items looked like they had been sitting there for hours. The staff were indifferent and not very helpful. Cleanliness was also an issue, with dirty tables left uncleared for long periods. For something labeled as a premium experience, this lounge did not deliver. Would not recommend unless you have no other option.",1
Worst lounge I've ever visited,"The worst lounge in the world, nothing sweet, nothing medium edible. Absolute garbage and full to bursting. Nothing recommended",1
Uncomfortable,This lounge is not recommended at all. It's like a better canteen. You can't find peace there at all. Cosy seating is sought in vain.,1
Maximal eco lounge,"They let more people in but fit in. Station atmosphere.
Wc Ladies 3 pcs with broken floor tiles....well
There are kl cake pieces and at the tables people are sitting.with notebooks or there are sleeping some on the benches
Only the staff is top",2
Very uncomfortable.,"Flew TAP business in the United States. Miami is even less normal, there's the A330, back from NY, there's the A321. Small, not comfortable cheap business class. Lounge at Lisbon airport, that's a separate story. It's full all the time, small, the seats are not comfortable, the food is disgusting. It's not just TAP in the room, it's other companies. Anyway, a national Portuguese low-cost carrier with business class.",1
Insufficient service for the price,"I occasionally travel in business class. This time, the first TAP experience between Lisbon and Geneva, I wanted to take advantage of my free time at Lisbon airport to go to the lounge, have a drink and eat something before my flight. This is the first time in all my travels around the world that the lounge is overcrowded. After 30 minutes of waiting, I walk through the door. Inside, it's hell, too many people, nothing's restful, the staff run all over the place, the bar is dirty and there wasn't much to eat. Anyway, the worst lounge experience of my life.

Given the price we pay for this service, I will avoid taking TAP in this configuration in the future.",2
A epic disappointment,"I moved from the ANA Lounge which was equally awful in hopes that there might be some seating availability. No such luck. A zoo, overcrowded, people sleeping fully stretched out, dreadful food. The glamour days of lounges and credit cards and airlines providing gratis access is an epic joke. DON’T BOTHER!",1
Horrible tour guide ruined the whole experience,"I had what was about the worst tour guide ever. Ricardo, sounded like a used car salesman and pretty clearly memorized a script and was repeating it word for word. I literally had thoughts about leaving the tour 20 minutes in.

On top of that, the script he memorized was horribly written and didn't at all sound authentic. Literally every one 1-2 minutes he would say ""Ladies and gentleman"" for 3 hour straight. And he tried to use every adjective in the book, and failed miserably. Often he would say ""... is unrealisticly"" hot, for example. And at other times like a car sales man would say ""We have not ONE, but TWO items for you sample"". And it sounded so fake.

The entire script sounded so fake and memorized that it completely ruined the experience. The food samples were fine, so that was good. He also didn't even engage the group for 2 minutes at the start to have everyone share where they were from or names.

All of the other tour guides from other companies, in stark contrast, feel like a local was being totally authentic and told a story. Ricardo was just spewing out facts with hyperbole and in such a scripted/memorized manner that it completely ruined the entire experience. He should NOT be doing any tours.",2
A space to avoid,"I visited the museum to see that it is very poor and dated. It presents a collection related to the torture of animals and, unfortunately, they try to convey the false idea that bulls are not harmed in Portugal, which is not true. Bulls and horses suffer various types of aggression and are killed at the end of the bullfight in a slaughterhouse. A place to avoid for anyone who likes and respects animals.",1
Cancelled without even warning,"Terrible experience. They cancelled the same day, without any warning. They say it is by river conditions when it is calmissimo and with several boats. A shame. Don't trust.",1
Please book your water taxi somewhere else,"After many attempts, I booked a taxi ride from Alcântara to Cacilhas, only to find on the day that there was no-one there. We waited for half an hour and eventually had to take the car to the other side of the river. We missed our restaurant reservation. We later heard from someone else with similar bad experiences. Our impression is that this company is not functioning well. I will take my service elsewhere.",1
"Unfriendly, miserable old fart!",Unfriendly unhelpful man. Service was terrible. I think he assumed that we weren’t wealthy so couldn’t be bothered to help us.,1
Very expensive,"Located inside the Praça do Comércio, there is this stand that serves Port tasting.
Prices for 4 glasses ranging from 17 upwards: as good ignorant ants we opted for the cheapest.
In fact, the propitiatory nectars were certainly up to par, but what cries out for vengeance are the paltry quantities that are served.
Enough",1
Lack of organization!,"Bad experience!
I wanted to offer tickets to my parents and some friends to watch a show, I called the theater, I was very well attended to by Mr. Carlos who was ready to help me choose the seats I wanted (next to the central middle aisle and in row G). He sent me the details with information about the places, payment references and the email address to which I should send the receipt.
A few days later I call the theater and ask if they have received payment and proof. They told me that everything was fine. I informed them that I am 350 km away and that I would not be able to collect the tickets, to which they replied that they do not send them by email and that they would simply be collected on the day.
On the day of the show, in advance, my parents and friends went to the ticket office, where they were asked to pay again because the tickets had not been paid for. They called me and I spoke to Mrs. Mila, who tells me that the tickets are not paid for. I inform them where I sent the receipt and after a few moments and confirming with colleagues, I concluded that they had been paid. After much confusion, tickets were allocated in a queue that was not the one intended and was not the one in which the reservation had been made. The lady was extremely arrogant, she didn't want to speak to me over the phone, as I handled the entire process, she informed me that there was nothing to do, so she would call the call center the next day. My parents and friends tried to resolve the situation and luckily they were allocated other places with better visibility. A very humiliating situation, a shame, without any organization.",1
Lugares horríveis,"Infelizmente estão a vender lugares que não deveriam ser para público . Balcão 1fila D sítio horrível! Tem hosstes que não tem capacidade de explicar os lugares . Foi a primeira vez que comprei em cima ,por não haver lugares em baixo ,mas isso e indignante,pois trouxe 3 meninas que não conseguiram assistir o espetáculo..
Estes lugares não deveriam existir, ou pelo menos explicar sempre ao cliente que são lugares de muito pouca visibilidade .
Estou muito triste .",1
Bad theater,"Air conditioning doesn't work, unbearable heat that makes it impossible to concentrate on the piece. Poorly educated and very poorly trained employees. I was almost assaulted by one of them because I didn't want to let my wife go to the bathroom on the other floor, the only bathroom available., and I had to force passage. I do not recommend the place.",1
"Oh, bad. Horrible and unacceptable service from the team.","Today at the 17 hours session of the play, I and 40 other people with a ticket were prevented from attending the show derived from the prepotence and arbitrariness of the service employees. Most people were delayed due to the chaotic traffic in the city of Lisbon, a fair on the avenue of liberty and at the same time a demonstration. They closed the doors of the theater and told everyone that there was only a 10-minute tolerance. I arrived 15 minutes late due to my mobility difficulty and I was not allowed in. All security missing mandatory identification. Ladies dressed in black “eventual uniform” also without identification and no one told us the name to complain. A lady who approached us at our request, informed that she was in charge in an arrogant Latin told the security to close the doors and that she would not talk to us anymore, nor had to explain anything. In my case, I asked why my request for priority and sensitivity was not met and this lady arrogantly showed no understanding. People started shouting “abram abram” “let us watch the show, we have a ticket” and nothing. Until one of us called the police! The Authority emerged, appeared some 15 policemen including personnel of the motorcycle intervention brigade. People complained gently but the lack of sensitivity and education of the staff leads a normal person to lose control. Little was missing but we would lose reason! I regret this situation happening in Portugal, I feel completely ashamed to know that there are Portuguese who do not meet the requirements of urbanity, sensitivity and reasonability. I didn't see the show and I had bought tickets for my family who was inside, not knowing what was going on out there. The most amazing thing is that the show started 20 minutes late and if we've been let in nothing of this shame had happened.
The staff at Tivoli Theatre BBVA Lisbon were a shame and did not represent the company dignely.",1
Avoid this place,Not friendly to tourists-they would not take my order and ignored me. The bar next door was tine- but I would avoid this rude place and go elsewhere,1
Classic tourist thing,"Not worth the money. The tour is short and fast, it is quick jumping on and off. You'll see as much if you walk that part along the sea",2
Dispensable,"Total nonsense. It only takes you from side to side. It's not high, it has no view of anything, it's just to waste time and money. Completely dispensable",2
,"this Attraction is expensive and unnecessary go your way (10min for this fare ....), doing it on foot is much better...",2
No point of interest,"The cable car is modern, quiet and great... But... I wouldn't count them among Lisbon's attractions. No wonder the taxi driver who drove us there did not know that there was a cable car in Lisbon at all. There is no nice view at all",2
Beware of the scam,"I was enjoying the trip, until when I got back, the so-called ""no strings attached photo"" they took of me was already printed without my consent and I needed to pay 10 euros.",1
Nothing special,"From the outside it seems interesting, in reality it is nothing special. You can get a one-way or return ticket. The journey is just over a kilometer but you don't see anything in particular except the sea and the buildings of the new city. Disappointing",1
We were deceived,"As soon as we entered the cabin, a photographer came to us and said that he would take a free photo and it would be delivered as soon as we left. To my surprise, we were charged €10.
It was a well-designed scheme to deceive people. This is mafia.
I will file a complaint against the company.",1
Discreto ma non eccezionale.,"Sbarco alla Stazione Oriente della Metropolitana e connessa Stazione ferroviaria, ove si può ammirare la bella ed originale copertura creata da Calatrava. Marcia di avvicinamento alle stazioni di partenza, piuttosto lunga in entrambi i sensi di marcia (consigliabile un bus per il ritorno, specie se c'è sole e fa caldo). Belle passeggiate lungo le rive. Piuttosto caro considerando che in genere si effettua un tragitto di sola andata, di pochi minuti. Vista interessante ma non eccezionale. Non lo ripeterei nè lo consiglierei.",2
Give it a miss,Very quick tele cable with not much to see from above. Only good thing was to get to the other end of the area from the aquarium.,2
We felt scammed,"While the driver and guide were excellent, they were contracted by TempoVIP and are not actual employees of theirs. The driver and guide were fantastic. This review pertains to TempoVIP itself. They had scammed us and charged €225 per person for a charcuterie board picnic in a public space. They claimed that it was because it included the cost of the tour of Biester Palace but the entry sign stated that it only costs €10 per person and so it was a complete scam.

They were not accommodating of minor changes and did not reserve the restaurant recommendation as we had asked. They were also very difficult to communicate with directly and would require multiple messages to get answers from them.

We would never recommend them again.",1
AVOID PURCHASING BABY CLOTHES,"The quality of baby clothes is very poor. I was given a baby suit the material of which became damaged after my baby wearing it only once. I took it to the shop to show the damage and they held onto it for over a week (during which I obviously couldn’t dress my baby in it) following which they told me to collect it and try washing it. I dutifully did this following which the problem was not resolved and I was told it actually didn’t matter and they would never replace it or provide an exchange. The material is of very poor quality. The customer service was terrible, and embarrassingly disappointing for such an overly expensive shop. I do NOT recommend purchasing baby clothes from this shop.",1
I had a bad experience,"I asked for a deep massage but the therapist who attended me did not have enough knowledge for this type of massage and applied very aggressive movements without prior preparation of the area and without distinguishing between muscles, tendons or bones. I complained several times but still I left with more pain than I had when I entered.",1
Forced change of therapists after paying,"Be VERY careful about how you book online. Even though you are given a time that specifies a person they can change it on you unless you go back and say ONLY this person. Terrible UI. In person I was not told until after I paid. Felt forced to proceed with someone random after taking the time to pick a therapist that mentioned physio therapy. Ended up much worse with numbness and tingling down the arms.
Very unhappy about this experience. Fix your UI. Notify clients of changes before they pay. Give them a choice to say no.",2
Lack of training,"No fault to the eager-to-please masseusse, and despite the wonderful vibe of the place, Terra Heal got one thing wrong: the massage. The person doing my body work lacked skill. I felt she could be easily be better with training and feedback in strokes, body knowledge, session management, etc. Using inadequately trained staff is a management issue.",1
Rua Da Madalena Terra Heal was Terrible,"My husband and I went for a 90 minute therapeutic couples massage. The venue is dimly lit with soothing music, quiet, and calm. They give you some tea. Terra Heal has two locations. DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON Rua Da Madalena!!!! We had two males that were both so inept and gross. We have had many massages and these two clowns were the worst. The guy who worked on me was pushing and shaking my body all over. He was so fast and inconsistent- I felt like he was treating my body as a piece of meat to pound on. I was so stressed out. I asked him, please slow down, but he couldn’t, he was all over the place and getting so close to my face breathing all over me. I thought I was going to be sick. It was not soothing at all!! My husband’s technician was neither here nor there. He was doing just enough to create some kind of massage without really being present or vested to do any thing real. Both were very unprofessional and I am wondering what training or licensing they have because it was basically paying €160 for a fake and very unpleasant massage. I reached out to the person who took our reservation and our money, but just like the massage- only response was platitudes.",2
Very disappointing,"Two years ago I came to your other salon, the massage was exceptional. I had also left a 5 star review.

But this evening what a disappointment, the massage started at 9:00 p.m. but was over after 50 -55 minutes.

Massage without interest a simple spread of oil with movement from bottom to top.

I don't call it a massage. My good friend could have done the same without paying 55 euros.

And to end it all I go back up at 9:55 p.m. and the team is rushing to close so I don't really want to drink herbal tea in this atmosphere.
I clearly felt too much.",2

Be at least prepared for bitter disappointment,"It was clear sky and little wind. But unfortunately we didnt see anything after 2.5 hours of boat ride.

We understand its wild life so nothing is guaranteed. But with the advertised success rate, our expectations were really high. If you have young children, we advise to think about this possibility. Our children were bitterly disappointed, there were lots of tears and this became the absolute low light of our Lisbon trip.

The crews were friendly. But as we didn't see anything, we didn't get any explanations, not about animals, not about monuments. Sitting thru the 2.5 hours was tough and we were really glad it was finally over. Maybe we were extremely unlucky. All the wholesome reviews you could find in different platforms did give us (maybe unrealisticly) high expectation.

We were offered another trip 3 days later or another trip in the future. But as tourists, it's highly unlikely for us to do it again. A partial refund would have been nice.",2
Erraram na massagem e cobraram,"Comprei uma massagem ombros, pescoço e cabeça. Com muita pena minha não massajaram nada a cabeça, referi isso e ainda assim ela continuou a massajar as pernas e os braços, quando não foi pedido.",2
Less time. Painful,It was my second time there in 10 days. The first time was great. So the second time I decided to go with the same therapist. But it was anything as the first time. I felt pain rather then relief and my Massage only lasted 45 minutes so several body parte weren't massaged. I would have expected better care for a returning and possibly long term customer,2
Horrible…all around a bad experience!,"1000% would not recommend this place. I made an appointment for a massage here for my mother and myself, and specifically asked twice to ensure we were in separate rooms. This was confirmed by the staff, twice, that we would be in separate rooms. After we show up, they were going to put us in the same room with a curtain separating the 2 of us. There was essentially no privacy and there would be no way that this would be relaxing to have a full body massage with my mother in the same room as me.

This was after we planned our entire day around these appointments and the staff really screwed this up. A day gone that we can’t get back for my mom’s first trip to Europe and a massage I was so looking forward to. The receptionist was not nice or willing to help at all, either.

Btw…there are only 2 rooms at this spa in the specific location where I visited. 1 room with a single bed and another room with 2 beds. So, unless they have another building somewhere else, this is what you should expect.

0 stars if I could rate it that.",1
Very disappointed,"Very Disappointing. Therapist used a mishmash of styles that really wasn’t working. Involved lots of hitting and pinching. When I asked her to stop pinching, she kept saying she had to open the energy lines, or would wait a few seconds and do it again harder. There is a spot on the back of my knee that is still hurting hours later. I have had many massages in many countries, digging or pinching the soft tissue on the back of the knee is avoided for obvious reasons. She also did not do the areas I asked for, she thought it was a back massage only, and when she realized it was full body she hurried over the rest. I asked several times to move to different areas, and she would nod and say yes, but not do it. Her strokes were very fast and pulling the skin a lot, not relaxing at all. When I left, the receptionist asked how it was, I said not so good, and the owner called me a little while later to offer for me to come back for a free massage. He said the therapists English was not good and the receptionist did not explain what I wanted well, it was a miscommunication. Not sure that really covers it, and I’m probably not interested in another massage like this one, but it’s 2 stars instead of one because at least they cared enough to call.",2
"Poor Communication, No On-the-Ground Support — Think Twice Before Booking","I recently traveled with Budget Wanderer as part of a group trip organized through Amigas y Más, and unfortunately, I cannot recommend this company based on my experience.

From the outset, communication was abysmal. I reached out multiple times via email with questions about the roommate list and the option to book my own room. After three unanswered emails, I had to go through our group founder just to get a response—only to then be told to message them on Instagram instead of receiving a proper reply through professional channels.

The issues continued once the trip began. The included transportation was not made available to everyone in our group, with extremely limited and poorly coordinated time slots. Upon arrival, the hotel refused to check us in until a Budget Wanderer representative showed up, which created confusion and unnecessary stress. There was no designated guide or point of contact for our group, and the absence of on-the-ground support was felt throughout the trip.

One of the most troubling moments came when the entire itinerary for a full day was changed without any notice or input from our group organizer. This lack of transparency and disregard for communication eliminated any sense of partnership or professionalism.

I also paid for a cooking class as part of my package. Our organizer tried to get pick-up details the night before, but Budget Wanderer didn’t respond until 5am the following morning—well after reasonable hours—causing us to miss the class entirely. Despite the company’s failure to communicate in a timely manner, they refused to issue a refund and falsely claimed that the pick-up time was clearly listed on the itinerary. It was not. Nor was there any mention of the itinerary being subject to change.

What’s most disappointing is the clear lack of accountability and basic customer service. At no point did it feel like Budget Wanderer was committed to delivering a quality experience or supporting its travelers. I would strongly urge anyone considering a trip with them to look elsewhere or, at the very least, proceed with caution.

Travel companies should be reliable, communicative, and responsive—Budget Wanderer was none of these.",2
Cancelled the day before due to “Logistical issues”,"They cancelled the tour the day before due to logistical issues and told us they could
Move to the next day…but we were already leaving Lisbon! Fortunately they promptly refunded our money but don’t understand why the collected the deposit and canceled less than 30 minutes later.",1
No parking,"I’m only rating it poor as there was no parking and crazy with cars squashed in everywhere . The tour guide was lovely and contacted us, and we drove past him to speak to him, but due to lack of parking we couldn’t get out of the car.
Being from another country and I do my research, I didn’t know the parking would be such an issue and we would have made alternative arrangements if we had of known …I was so looking forward to this tour! sorry",1
Missed trip,Pickup directions were so confusing I couldn’t find the pickup spot as a result I missed the trip There was no phone number to call for help There was no phone number to call for refund,1
Disappointing overall,"Sintra and Cascais guided tour – disappointing overall

The tour started badly: the guide arrived 30 minutes late. We then lost about 30 extra minutes to pick up other customers, then a forgotten child seat, which unnecessarily lengthened the start of the day.

The transport was also uncomfortable: we were three adults in the front of the minivan, which is not suitable for a long journey.

During the visit to the Palais de la Regaleira, we noticed that the guide seemed to be reselling some unused tickets, which raised questions about the transparency of the organization.

The tour ended at 5:30 p.m. instead of the 6:00 p.m. scheduled, which, combined with the morning delays, reduced our actual time at the sites.

Only really positive: the recommendation of the restaurant in Cascais, which was worth a visit.

Overall, the experience does not justify the €100 per person requested.",2
AVOID.,"AVOID! I appreciate a real review before booking and hope to save someone from the experience we had. 1.) Our guide was driving while calling, texting, internet (as well as maps), hit a sign when parking, came inches from backing into an oncoming car in a round about, blew through a stop sign (luckily on a small road). Not a safe driver.
2.) Shouldn't the plan with the tide tables and boat be known ahead of time and planned appropriately so it's not a constant question through the day if you can even attend the castle part of the tour? The whole tour seemed very unorganized. 3.) The guide was very hard to understand at times for most of the group. When we got to the templer church there were other guides taking their groups around explaining the subjects of paintings ect. Basically what's expected for a tour guide. We had the most general of explanations and were then tol
d we could walk around for 10 minutes. He was not pleased and somewhat condescending when we attempted to ask questions. Frankly I think the knowledge base was minimal or perhaps the conversion of that knowledge to English simply was not there. 4.) Because of a sporting event in Lisbon the drop off point was changed. We had not known how much it would change! We were dropped off a 30 minute walk away-there was a poor elderly couple with us. They took the tour as they thought they would be dropped off next to their hotel. He couldn't walk up steps due to health issue so the metro was not an option (this is what our guide stated to do ) no ubers or taxis due to the game. They did not have internet on their phones. He just kicked them out of the van and said goodbye. We made sure they got home walking but it was very hard for them.",1
"Skip the line convenient, but did not learn much about the Cloister and its history.","This Jeronimo tour is only good for the skip the line entry. I don’t believe our guide Bruno really had any historic knowledge of the cloister or the people that dwelled there. He brought his homeland Angola into the discussion which was not relevant to the cloister. He was late to meet the group, and the audio headsets were not always working well for many people. but for skip the line and getting in and out, it is convenient. We did not learn very much about the history of the cloister if that is something you are looking for.",1
GetYourGuide the worst to travel,"We showed up in advance of the meeting point (08:00) and the operator Cooltours did not show up and also did not give timely notice. We waited until 08:30, called and were told that the driver and guide had had an urgency. We request the refund of the activity, 170 euros (2 people), which did not happen and that GetYourGuide protected. We headed to Sintra on our own, we spent 65 euros round trip by Uber. In the town of Regaleira Cooltours offered us in “Compensation” to join a local tour, we asked and clarified if they would return our money and we all confirmed even the guide Ricardo that it was a “compensation”. The activity lasted 2 hours of the original 8 hours. At the end of the day we were informed that they would not return our money. I claimed GetYourGuide and presented conversation photos and expense voucher. Result GetYourGuide stated that it would not return the tours and that it supported the operator Cooltours. Just a robbery. Since then GetYourGuide blocked me from placing comments on their page, I can only access purchase, which I will never do again. I've traveled many places before and it's the first time I've had such a negative experience",1
"Customers, f#+# them","Tour didn't go, not even informed about it, after 30 minutes waiting I called them, they say tour is not going, such awful customer service. Problem with van. They couldn't find a vehicle to transport 3 people in the whole damn world. Just BS! I get the feeling that either three customers weren't worth the hassel or they needed the van for another bigger group. But the total lack of communication was the worst.",1
Pick Any other option. Awful tour operator!!,"Absolutely the worst tour guide. Instead of learning about the monestary and history of the building, we were subjected to a three hour rambling history tour of 50 years of Lisbon. I can’t say enough bad things. So angry we wasted our money!! The guide was from Italy. Telling, at the end of the chapel tour he skipped Jerónimos tomb. AWFUL!!! Wish we could receive a refund!!!",1
Poor Marriott Bonvoy Homing experience,"I stayed at a Marriott Bonvoy homing apartment in Lisbon, Largo dos Arautos, for four nights in May 2024. The apartment itself was clean, but the furnishings were poor. The rug in the living area was old, and with many stains.

After having spent two nights in a beautiful Marriott hotel in Porto, with comfortable bedding and nice towels, the apartment in Lisbon was a huge disappointment! My queen bed had an uncomfortable mattress, with a poorly fitting, old flat sheet barely covering it, (no fitted sheet) and just a thin duvet as a cover. There was no top sheet (except the above mentioned). The two pillows were small and lumpy. There was no extra bedding, no blanket or extra pillows. There were two older towels left for each person, certainly not what one gets in a Marriott hotel. There was no hand soap in the bathrooms requiring us to go to supermarket to buy. There was no hair dryer, as advertised.

I can say that the apartment was clean, but otherwise would never recommend a Marriott Bonvoy apartment. It is certainly not what is advertised, and does not meet the Marriott standards! I thought for sure, that I would have a much better experience!",2
A real disappointment,"I can only say that for me it was a real disappointment. I booked this tour explicitly because it was in Spanish and it was total chaos. It was the second time I booked this excursion because I went a few years ago with my mother and it was an incredible experience, we loved the guide and I booked this excursion again thinking of sharing it with my partner on his birthday and it turns out that the rest of the The group was English and unfortunately the guide Nuno only spoke in English because what little Spanish he spoke was not understood. I don't know how they can get a guide like that who barely knows how to speak Spanish or English. I was very sorry that my partner didn't even know about half of the excursion and no matter how much I asked Nuno to explain in Spanish, he translated half of it and I ended up explaining to my partner half of the excursion that I could remember from the previous one. excursion. I am truly sorry for what a regrettable excursion it was that we did not take advantage of the day as much as the previous time.",1
A van ride and an unadvertised shanghai,"Typically don't like to leave negative reviews unless the experience was awful. But at the insistence of Cooltours-Lisbon's 5:00a texts trolling for positive reviews here is our input. To start with, if we had learned our driver was late because he gave notice and was talked into one last trip it would have explained the enthusiasm. Basically the 93.00 was for a van ride little explanation and then there was the surprise 25 euro fixed price lunch at a desolate restaurant. Having dinner reservations in Lisbon we passed. Would have enjoyed a coffee but that was 25 euros also. The good news, our driver got the preverbal free lunch and Cooltours most likely got their beaks wet. Wasted over an hour which we would have loved to have spent in Cascais rather than the whistle stop we got. The sights were terrific the company not so much.",2
Disappointed experience,"We were very disappointed with our tour: we paid for small-group tour but it was 18 people plus the driver and the guide. We paid for pick-up and drop-off from/to our hotel, but it was not happened. It was many messages that we have to come to the meeting point, then somebody come. We were drop-off not at our hotel and nobody care, even we did not know we're we are. They tour guide recommend to take a taxi to our hotel.",2
Not worth it,"We do not recommend this tour company. As others have noted, the tour was rushed and there was not enough time allocated for Regaleira or Pena. Our tour guide Miguel did not seem to want to be there. He was primary focused on telling us what time we had to be back on the bus and threatening to leave us behind if we came back late. He gave us minimal details on the sites, was not approachable, and always seemed to want to be somewhere else. We got back to Lisbon 2 hours before the tour was supposed to end and clearly could have spent more time at the sites instead. We did not feel we got our money's worth for having such a rushed experience and a negative tour guide.",2
Poor service,"Your guy/driver has an attitude and was frowns the whole trip. Uncleared meeting point at Fatima caused my group and another group to go look for the guy for 40 minutes and he had the nerves to blame us! If 3 out of the 7 people total in the tour were lost and had to search for you, then that’s a you problem, not us. I have booked tours in Paris, Barcelona and Lisbon and this tour left a sour taste.",1
"Worthy sites, apathetic guide","The sites were worth the trip, vehicle was clean and comfortable but the guide — who set the tone and learning— was awash with negativity.",2
Not as advertised,"This tour is not what they claim it to be. You do not get to see Pena Palace, only the gardens. It was supposed to be a guided tour as well, our guide stayed with the bus.

Tour was badly organized, spent too much time waiting for the bus, rushed through stops.

It was supposed to be a small group tour but we ended up with 18 for the same price.

Waste of time and money",1
Not the tour we were hoping for.,"Cooltours via Get Your Guide: Tour to Sentra
While this tour hit all the right places, it was so poorly organized that we ended up spending most of our time waiting in lines or waiting for tardy tour mates. The guide was terrific but had to spend much of her time fighting fires and reorganizing the tour because of our lateness. Finally, the tour vehicle broke down. I’m not sure how you avoid these long lines but I’m sure the good tour operators have figured out the best ways around this. Obviously Cooltours has not. We give them one clam on the coveted Five Quahog Rating Scale.",1
Poor day in Sintra,A guide that actually provides some insight into what you are seeing would have been nice. Our guide used his microphone once to introduce himself and never again. He shared no info about Sinatra in general or about things we were passing as he drove A better explanation of what the tour includes and expectations would have been beneficial. We spent almost the entire tour walk to and from sites. We rarely do organized tours and won’t be rushing back to do another after this experience,1
Irish setting but not nice,"Poor welcome, no empathy from the waitresses, no time to drink your drink, systematically removed, no smile. I do not recommend",1
"Chic clothes, no VAT","Honestly the clothing was pretty cool. If you are visiting from abroad it’s an interesting place to grab local designers. However, ironically, they claim to be a tax free shop but they and all of their sister locations in Porto are unable to actually help with processing the refund so there will be no tax refunds for visitors so plan on pricing being 20% higher than you thought. They only tell you this after they give you your total. I still bought some stuff but definitely am not happy with them at all. VERY DISAPPOINTING.",2
Product not received,"I placed an order for a product on December 6, 2024. Due to logistical issues related to my address, I never received the item.

I sent multiple emails to customer service, but I never received a response on how to proceed with a new shipment or regarding my refund request.

Today is February 1st, and I still haven’t heard back from customer support",1
BUYER BEWARE!!! Awful customer service and shady practices,"BUYER BEWARE!!! Awful customer service and EXTREMELY RUDE employees. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!! They may ""forget"" to include it in your bag with your purchase so if there are any issues and you need to return it they will not without the receipt.

Wanna be hipsters work at this store with over the top attitude. Definitely not worth the high cost of merchandise for cheaply made items.",1
Scam alert!!!,"Scam alert!!! Utterly ridiculous and terrible!! Cancelled the trip without any warning at all. They claimed that they emailed us during lunch but no emails came through, more than 10 people arrived, none of us recieved any emails at all until 19:01(the event starts time was supposed to be 19:00).

They promised there will be a full refund, however, the refund we got was only a partial refund, they kept the processing fee. When asked why it wasn't a full refund, then they just stopped replying. Message was sent on Friday, last seen was today (Monday) , two messages ignored completely!!!!",1
Skip the Pena Palace,"Too many people long lines, best view of Pena is from Moorish castle, so simply skip Pena altogether and just hit the Moorish castle & go to Atlantic coast or Cascais",1
Do Not Book This Tour - They Won't Show Up!!!!,"We booked this tour weeks in advance and paid for it. On the day of our tour no one ever showed up. After a half an hour of trying to call the company with no answer they finally responded said we were ""outside of their area of service"" even though our hotel was located in central Lisbon (even though they had our pick up information at our hotel for weeks). We did eventually receive a refund weeks later; however, not so much as an apology for being a no-show. Do yourself a favor and don't waste a day of your vacation with these people - they are completely unreliable! Not the hassle you want on your vacation!",1
The rogue tuk tuk,"Honestly, the tuk tuk ride is something to do but you have to take the time to choose your guide because he takes great joy in pillaging tourists. We paid 240 euros for a ride that was supposed to cost 150 euros, so be careful, we took the buddy company and our guide was José after having defrauded us he asked us to give him a good serious opinion we should not take people for idiots disappointed with this walk the next day we spoke with another guide who told us that the walk that we took should have cost us 150 euros we must not rush and take the time to compare the guides and tuk tuk company I do not recommend the pink tuk tuk buddy",1
Lisbon food,No one showed up to the meeting place at 3PM . WILL DISPUTE THE CHARGE THRU MY CREDIT bad bad bad baby baby bad bad baby call me,1
"If you want to be treated really BADLY, go to this spa","I did facial treatment with therapist Yara. And she removed by her father fingers, applying hard pressure on my skin. She said it's a ball of blood and she doesn't know what it is. And I couldn't even see that she is applying pressure on my mole as I waz laying down on bed with eyes covered. At the end of treatment, I saw the demage on my skin. It's right in the center of my face. I told Yara why would she even touch my mole and she answered that it was a ball of blood and she doesn't know what was that. I was hoping it will get healed and disappeared. But with few days it got worst. Sofia Pereira, the owner of Spa, admitted this situation should not have happened and asked Yara to see my face, so she would never touched someone face in such situations. And instead of solving damage to me, taking me to clinic , they left me ignored. Sofia Pereira consulted her lawyer and the lawyer advised to not help. She even convinced Yara to lie and said that she didn't even touch my face. I felt horrible as they avoid taking responsibility for their own actions . And even worst they decided to lie instead to cover their business as per lawyer suggestions. It inhuman. And they have to ashamed by their inhuman and unprofessional behaviour. I am hoping that I will find doctor myself as they refused even to help with finding doctor. I hope there will be no scar or cancer, as it's a delicate area under mole which can't be touched by facial therapist at all.",1
Spa facilities not included in massage price,"Apparently the spa facilities, pool./sauna are not included with massages, despite confirmation email advising you to arrive 30 minutes earlier to use them. I have never been to a 5 star hotel spa where this is not included in the massage price.

Will never come here again.",1
Very bad :(,"Horrible.
The animation is nothing special, it has very little about the film.
The food was awful, a little pasta with nuts (whichever dish was, they were the same), cold wine and little quantity, we all starved.
The only good part of the party is actually being on a boat.
But the space is small and there are a lot of people, we can barely move it inside.
They could keep but lower the price because it is very expensive (28€) for what they offer or withdraw the dinner and make only party or improve the dinner.",1
Bad experience,"Bad experience, we took a 1-hour tour in Alfama, they didn't stop at the main tourist attractions, there was only one stop, and they still wanted to charge me 20 euros more to complete the tour. The driver was very rushed, he said the company gave them little time to complete the tour. the company only thinks about money, not customers",1
Not a local guide - Tourist trap rip’Off,"It’s not a local guided tour. This is outsourced to a company that pays non-local students to take you to tourist traps. You’d be better off on your own saving your money.

Il ne s’agit pas d’une visite guidée locale, mais d’une entreprise qui paie des étudiants non locaux pour qu’ils vous emmènent dans des pièges à touristes. Nous sommes tous capables de faire bien mieux par nous mêmes !
A 75e/ pers ! On peut s’offrir de vraies bonnes spécialités !!!",1
Rather poor,"We had dinner here with a large group of friends on a fixed and already agreed upon menu, but none of us were happy with the choice made. Lots of kindness, pleasant surroundings, but poor and not very tasty food.",2
Not worth waiting for,"Terrible waiting time - no control whatsoever, totally inefficient considered several times to leave the queue and find other things to experience",1
Completely overcrowded,"Completely overcrowded. Despite booking a time slot online, you have to queue long before you can even get to the palace. The wait to get to the palace entrance was 90 minutes. The tour of the palace rooms also takes place in a caravan of people. Horrible.",1
Useless ticket system - lengthy queues!,The ticket system is a total farce! You go online to buy a time entry ticket to avoid queuing and on arrival are told to join the queue. “Don’t worry about your timed ticket” we were told…..we I do as the whole point was to avoid staying in a one hour queue! Totally unacceptable.,1
Tickets not received,I did not receive my paid tickets. Viator could not find the tickets and the organizer was not available.I did not get any help and no one was responsible for the problem.,1
Bad experience!!,They never sent me my tickets so I couldn’t enter the palace because there was no room left and we had to buy tickets to enter the palace park on site.,1
False advertisement on Trip Advisor,"The attraction on Trip Advisor was for ""skip the line"" tickets. Once I paid for the ticket, an on-line voucher was delivered to my email, not an actual pdf ticket. When I arrived at the attraction there was a massive line up for tickets. I asked the attendant where I could convert the voucher for a ticket. She told me that I must have a pdf ticket and that there is no ""skip the line"" option there. My only option then was to join the ticket line with everyone. What then is the advantage of buying the ticket on Trip Advisor? Not willing to waste time standing in the huge line. I left in frustration and did not see the attraction that I paid for.",1
"Time, time, time","We were unable to see the palace due to time constraints and traffic. Make sure to plan for plenty of time and don’t drive, have someone drive for you. We plan to be back!🙂",2
No Show,"The tour operator cancelled at 940pm the night before the 10am Tour, so we showed up via taxi not aware of cancellation. No reason was given.",1
Deception,You are misled by the term skip the line. You can only buy a ticket and join the back of the line. Tickets were also not available at pickup location. Eventually have to call and whatsappe to get tickets. Then they were told they were regular tickets instead of skip te line tickets. Advice: do not book!,1
Horrible Experience!,"This company never delivered the tickets. I received the confirmation a night before, but the tickets never arrived. I got in touch with one of the reps and they said they had oversold because of system glitch which is BS. The problem that we were already in Sintra and couldn't buy the tickets to the palace directly at the gate because they were sold out. Horrible experience. Do not buy from them!",1
Trip Advisor did not send me the tickets I paid for,I paid for these tickets through Trip Advisor in advance. I did not receive them from Trip Advisor. Just an email that looped me back and forth between click here for your tickets and them not populating. I had to pay at Peña Palace again (also is much cheaper than paying online). Other people in line had the same problem.,1
"TukTuk driver didn't show, tour operator didn't respond.","Unfortunately, despite booking to be picked up at our hotel, our TukTuk driver didn't turn up. I tried calling the tour organiser, but the number rang out and no one answered. I tried the automated chat with the tour operator, but got no reply. After half an hour of waiting we gave up and booked through another company that our hotel recommended (who was fantastic).",1
Find a Different Tour,"There were many different tours in this type of vehicle available. We chose this specific tour because of the time available, and being picked up at our hotel. Our tour was scheduled to start at 4:20 P.M. but we were not picked up until 5:00 P.M. The condition of our vehicle was not the best. It looked shabby compared to the many other Tuk Tuks we saw during our tour. During the tour our driver was stopped and questioned by the Lisbon police. We found this a little disturbing. Our driver told us that it was a minor problem with the vehicle registration. Since we did not understand the language we had no way of knowing what the real problem was. At the last stop on the tour our driver told us we needed to find our own way back to our hotel, which was over 5 miles away! He insisted that we should have known our tour was only for half the day. We insisted that he did not tell us this at the start of the tour, or anytime during. If we had known the tour did not end at our hotel we never would have booked it. Finally the driver did the right thing and took us back to our hotel, complaining all the way back.",2
STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOUR.,"Terrible. Absolutely stay away from this tour. We waited over an hour and a half, contacted the host repeatedly with no reply at all & they did not show up to our hotel pick up location. Then trip advisor has the nerve to allow the host to deny our request for a refund when we did not receive the service we expected. Spent over $129 and received this kind of treatment.

If I could leave less than a 1 rating I would. Disgusting behavior and unacceptable.",1
"Don’t bother, no tour and no refund!",I waited over 90 minutes in total in 30 degree heat and my driver never showed up. Disaster. I rang the contact number provided and it would ring out or ever second call it would say the number is switched off. I paid €95 and I’m now really struggling to get my money back because you have to have an email from the company to confirm the tour didn’t happen for Viator to refund you but they don’t have a contact email for the company! Very disappointed.,1
Vreselijk,"Via de app hoorde ik op de dag zelf dat hij zijn tuktuk niet voldoende had geladen! Of de toer 2 uur later kon, niet dus! Zou wat regelen en kwam om 11.30 uur met een andere klant in de tuktuk aan! Heb toen gezegd onacceptabel, heb privé toer geboekt…ik wilde tien mijn geld terug…maar dat zou ik dan zelf moeten regelen Inmiddels andere tuktuk met Claudia gearriveerd! Heeft voor ons alles geregeld, tel contact gehad met de baas. Refund geregeld en zelfde bedrag aan Claudia betaald na een echte Portugese prachtige Tour!!!!!",1
Unable DE find a place and very noisy,"We are a fan DE the one DE Porto. But then... Extremely bunting, no DE outdoor tables, no DE room is an ordeal to eat with 4.
In short we will not return.
Too bad because the quality DE the food is good.",2
I do not recommend the workshops,Bad system. It took me over 8 months to try to book a workshop!!! Or you can't mark because they aren't on the site yet or they're exhausted... besides that prices change and then you have to pay extra. I do not advise anyone,1

No one's answering and the message box is full.
The answer you gave in relation to my previous message is not correct.",1
"Crowded, dirty, loud music…","Crowded, loud music that doesn’t allow you to talk (like all the bars around the area - why can people just enjoy the sounds of other people talking?), dirty tables, costumers who don’t know how to behave (not respecting lines, workers, not removing their plates). Overpriced food for tourists, not authentic at all. The food was just ok.",2
Disappointment across the board,"unfortunately, it was not as felt by every guide touted as a top address, very disappointing. Loud, completely overpriced and not exactly very well maintained. Both the tables where to sit and the sanitary facilities leave much to be desired in terms of cleanliness. Furthermore, the music is much too loud inside and does not invite you to linger. It's a pity, it has potential.",1
Could be much better,"Very crowded, even late afternoon. Just had beers: food looked and smelled excellent. Staff very slow to clear tables. Tables not wiped. Had to queue for ladies' toilet: toilets needed cleaning. Perceived there is an issue with pickpockets (based on conversation overheard with security guard). Card payments only.",2
"Chaotic, noisy tourist trap",We visited early Sunday lunchtime expecting it to be busy as it is a must-see allegedly. However we were unprepared for the crowds already there. Near impossible to find a seat and queues at most of the vendors counters. If your idea of fun is trying to carve you way through a wall of human flesh then you’ll enjoy this place. Not my idea of a good time though. The noise levels were off the scale. Full of people taking selfies and taking photos of their food. A real tourist trap. Ghastly place. We left without eating as we couldn’t stand the experience.,1
Over rated,"Seriously overrated. The food is ok. Of the three dishes we had, one was good, second was average, third was a tiny portion served on a small square tray. Lots of pretentiousness around food, but very little quality. Also the space is really crowded, noisy and busy. A couple next to us set up a camera and filmed themselves eating. It's that kind of place.",1
Nice enough but lead to violent food poisoning,Nice place with lots of food to choose from. Unfortunately I had the seafood rice and ended up with horrendous food poisoning that was really violent. Recommend anyone who goes here avoids the fish as it was not cooked properly and certainly was not worth all the grief.,1
Not worth a visit!,Messy and loud. Full of people and no seats available. Impossible to get around and impossible to see the range that existed. We walked away as fast as we could!,1
Overrated,"We went to this for lunch because it was recommended to us as a cute thing to do. It was very crowded and the few remaining seats were a little dirty. The food was ok, but very expensive by Lisbon standards.",2
Bof,"Very noisy place.
Cannot find a table, we have breakfast standing, so cold (for croquettes) while trying to find a table available in vain.",2
Not my thing...overpriced and overcrowded,"I went as my friend had it on our tick list but I was not impressed. I get it is a big place but just so overcrowded, did not end up eating there for several reasons, food was over priced, hardly anywhere to sit and the noise...could barely hear yourself think. Saying that, I am glad we went, just to experience it for the short time we did",2
The market and markets,"Once a food market in the historic centre of Lisbon, this complex is now quite difficult to describe and evaluate because it actually includes two very different realities that coexist as if separated at home; hence my vote, which is the result of an average.

The western sector, open in the morning, has maintained the characteristics of the traditional market, with the usual supply of food, especially fruit and vegetables; overall it is interesting, for the assortment, for the not excessive prices, and for a certain authenticity; it is not impossible to see residents doing their daily shopping, which is much more unlikely instead in the equally well-known Bolhão market in Porto.

In the other sector, with its already very evocative name of Time Out Market, the market gives way... to the markets: a huge shack with a jumble of outlets where everything - lights, sounds, colors, writing, ubiquitous English - seems made especially to ensnare the tourist, who is manned with everything from pizza to sushi, but nothing of what the average Portuguese usually eats. Prices are sky-high, almost all outlets require only electronic payments (in a country where paying by cash is by far the prevailing option), the manner of consumption - once you have laboriously obtained the order you have to go crazy to try to perch on a piece of free bench - reminiscent of those of battery-locked chickens, or, if you prefer, a 1936 Chaplin film.

Already in the morning the crowding is substantial, but in the evening, as I was told,
turns into a bolgia from which the Lebanese carefully steer clear. Even more so in a city like Lisbon, where you can still eat in small typical restaurants for very reasonable amounts, eating your own meals here seems really self-defeating to me.",2
Super expensive and crowded,"Tourist too much, very expensive and too crowded even at non-canonical times, even at 16:30 difficult to find a place
There are plenty of pockets and restaurants where you can spend less and eat well",1
Portugal by van,"Very noisy and very expensive place!!!
You have to be on the lookout to have a free table to install because there is no reservation possible.
For me it’s a tourist catch...",2
Insta hell,Don’t waste your time unless you’re solo you won’t get a seat to eat it’s full of people taking photos of their food and holding seats it’s over priced go to a proper restaurant there’s hundreds of them,1
To flee,"No room, very expensive, very poor quality... to flee. There is much better in Lisbon. I had to follow, it’s a shame.",1
"Avoid - over priced, busy, chaotic, average quality food","Avoid this place at all costs. It a tourist trap for visitors wanting to be seen at the trendiest eatery in Lisbon. You cannot book a table, you have to turn up and then sprint around the main area competing with others, hoping to spot someone leaving their seat and then grab it before someone else. There is a constant drum of noise, shouting and machinery whirring away, relaxing it is not. There is a wide range of food choices, something for everyone, which may be enough of a reason to visit. However the prices are excessively high, and they food quality does not justify it. We paid 100 Euros for four ""gourmet"" burgers with not enough chips and a glass of coke. I would have been happier with four big Mac's and 50 Euro's change in my pocket. If you want a relaxing evening meal for a couple of hours, then this is the last place you would want to go.",1
Over Hyped Tourist Trap,This place is super hyped up and tourists flock there. We went twice the second time out of convenience only and we thought we would play it safe and have pizza. The first time was from Asian Lab. on both occasions the quality of the food was awful. The environment was chaotic. The food hall at the Colombo Shopping Centre was bigger and better. Go there instead,2
"Dangerous place, bad service, I almost got stolen inside.","Tourists, watch out! Don't visit this place. I was the victim of an attempted theft, I was able to notice when a bastard tried to move into my backpack. I arrested the vagabond and called security, which, besides doing nothing, still let him escape. I complained to the manager, who simply told me that “Portugal is like that.” A shame. I will never come back and do not recommend.",1
Fast food restaurants,"For me it was a waste of time, there are a few mini restaurants that serve a fast food style and it is close to the sodré. It's not a tourist Attraction.",2
Worse food of all Lisbon,"Worse food in Lisbon
Avoid, the food here is average to bad when comparing to the great restaurants around the city.

"No big deal, just the industrial vibe","The seat itself is nice, but it's a mess to manage the seat at the table while everyone orders at a different stand.
The.pizza Margherita 14.5 is madness, of course we stayed away from a Margherita made in Portugal at that price.
Nice for young people but nothing fancy for a family.",2
Even not.,"Stay away from this place, classic tourist place where you pay a lot and eat badly, the only time I ate badly in Portugal.",1

"Avoid at all costs , unless you like airport departure lounges",Stayed in here for 5 minutes. Hot crowded and just corporate. Benches and benches of people crammed in. Noisy and like a school or work canteen. Prices higher than going out to a local cafe . Give locals the money not some large corporation.,1
Che delusione!,"...even this ""market"" has been transformed into a temple of tourism where you eat and drink with a very low quality / price ratio. Peccato!",2
Very average,"Concept is fashionable ""insta"", noisy and expensive for the quantities distributed. More business.... 22€ for these 2 dishes ... bof",2
Not good.,"So disappointing. The only disappointment we had in Lisbon. Was expecting a top quality food market, with places to eat. What we found was more akin to a school canteen. Monotone food stalls, bench tables the length of the hall, yet scores of people wandering around with trays looking forelornly for a place to sit. Loud, crowded, hot. All of that could have been forgiven if the food was good, but it was distinctly average stuff. Quality wise, it fell a mile below the rest of Lisbon and is 3 times the price.

Avoid!",1
Ugh,"Expensive compared to the quality.

Few Portuguese stands.

And loud and painful music inflicted on everyone…..

The place deserved better as the Spaniards were wise to do it",2
Absolutely terrible,"I absolutely cannot understand all the positive experiences here. It is deafeningly loud, the food is greasy and expensive, and it is so crowded that you can hardly move.
All the seats are taken and will stay that way because everyone is stuck to their seats and eating like a disco. I have never seen a culture that does something like that.
Instead, you are offered all kinds of drugs by obscure dealers outside the entrances - enjoy!",1
To be avoided,"In a historic structure, a company has created a series of street food stands, with high prices; the tables on which to then consume the food, as well as being very crowded, are not the most hygienic.",1

Tourist trap,"The concept is nice but the bill is less so, €21 for a plate of tagliatelle Bolognese or 4 ravioli fighting a duel. Damage.....",1
NOT WORTH IT AT ALL,"Old market converted into a joint for tourists with ordinary food at delicatessen prices. It's not worth it at all. There are a lot of people, it is difficult to find a place to sit and there is simply no cleaning service, you depend on the neatness of the previous users. In my case I ate a hamburger of similar quality to those of the large chains at an exorbitant price. Possibly if they pass by and want to see it, that's fine, but nothing more.",2
Tourist Trap,"Avoid like the plague. This is a tourist trap. There are so many delicious restaurants in Lisbon. On our last night, we were lazy and didn't feel like searching out a restaurant so we walked over to check out the market. Everything was overpriced and not nearly as good as all the other food we had while we were in the city. This was nothing like the market in Madrid, for example, or in other places in Europe. It is modern but lacks real Portuguese charm. Walk through if you like, but get your food and drinks elsewhere.",2
Boring !,"We were disappointed with this “market”. It was not a traditional Portuguese marketplace. It was more similar to a giant food court shopping mall. We found the prices to be high, seating uncomfortable, and the atmosphere sadly lacking.",2
What to avoid at lunchtime,"The concept is nice but the whole thing is sorely lacking in organization. The flow of people coming to eat there should be controlled. Far too many people compared to the number of seats. We found ourselves like two idiots with our tray without room for lunch. People lack good manners and take your seats from under your nose and sit down and chat before going to get food, when they don't put down their jackets to save seats. To escape at lunchtime.",2
terrible,"We tried it twice at different times. It was terrible both times. The noise level in the hall in general, and the loud music, didn't make it a pleasant place to eat. But it was obviously a real tourist hotspot, because it was always full. Some of the sellers at the stands were very arrogant. There are so many nice little cafes and bistros where you can enjoy yourself. In mid-October it's still around 25 to 30 degrees, so there's no need to sit in a hall like that :-)",2
Disappointing,"a beautiful, well-appointed place but at what price! It's not cheap... if you want to have lunch, count on €30 per person minimum... considering what you can find in Lisbon... move on if you're looking for authenticity!",2
Lost its way I'm afraid,"We came here in 2020 pre-Covid and it was something different but sadly, 4 years on, it seems to have lost some of its best outlets and turned itself into an over-priced tourist trap. Lots of other, far more reasonable, places to eat in Lisbon so we won't be rushing back.",2
"Not inclusive for LGBTQIA+ people, a shame","Non-inclusive place for LGBTQIA+ people.

The vigilantes in front of the bathrooms discriminate against gender fluid people by preventing people from choosing which bathroom to go to.

In 2024, a shame",1
"Expensive, crowded, and loud","We came, we looked, and we left. I don't get the hype. Yes there's lots of food options but it's all overpriced. You can get better food at nice small restaurants in Lisbon with a better atmosphere and lower prices. This is a commercialized market for tourists.",1
Lisbon Market. Cais do Sodré,"Very crowded at lunch time, but a nice place to visit. Good location and good restaurants nearby.",2
DISAPPOINTING,"Bad experience, they don't accept credit cards or euros, and the person who sells the payment card is completely unprepared",1
"Bad experience, I don't recommend it.","It goes from bad to worse. The market is horrible with dirt everywhere. We went to dinner and decided to go to Henrique Sá Pessoa, we ordered 3 burgers, 2 black pork and 1 fried cuttlefish. The first ones were full of mayonnaise and so we couldn't tell if they were good or not because everything tasted the same. The cuttlefish was horrible, the dark bread was terrible and the cuttlefish had to be frozen and fried, it had no flavor whatsoever, the fries were soft and cold. It couldn't be better than this, we paid the modest sum of 55.50 euros for 3 miserable nails and 2 water. It's a shame for a Chef like Sá Pessoa to let his spaces be ruined due to a lack of professionalism. Paying yes, but eating well is necessary.",1
The Americana of the century for foreigners,"It is one more of those that have been lavished in Lisbon lately. Queues to buy food and drinks, expensive prices and you eat at tables next to everyone. The food trays take a long time to be collected. Pitiful place",1
Tourist trap,This place is totally over rated. Not sure what all the hype is about but there are plenty of places to eat and drink at in the area. A lot of tourists and lot a who lot of locals.,1
Lisbon Dining Experience,"While Time Out Market in Lisbon offers a wide variety of food options, my experience was marred by an unwelcoming atmosphere. Unfortunately, the unfriendly demeanor of the people and the uncomfortable stares from others created a less-than-pleasant dining environment. It may not be the ideal place if you're seeking a relaxed and welcoming dining experience. For example, Monte Mar, my husband simply asked for one extra fork, the cashier/server told him that one order only comes with one fork. Let’s avoid “Fork Controller” and unfriendly customer service.",1
Too crowded. Average food,"Too busy. No one respects people who are ordering food. People sit and wait for other when we want to find a table they are all taken. Food is okay, different options but did not feel local at all. Seen it and that's it. Prefer smaller restaurants",2
Unfortunately disappointing,"We were there early in the morning, which was good because it was relatively empty. But we think that was one of the few good things. It is purely a tourist attraction and we had hoped for a lot more. That doesn't mean that the quality is super bad, but rather average quality at comparatively higher prices.",2
Very disappointing,Was very busy. Ate at croqueteria. Food was awful. Croquettes not good. Sweet potato fries and roasted potatoes stale snd unpleasant to eat. Very disappointing.,2
"Be aware, expensive!!!",First; it appears very nice and hip. Second; extremely expensive for Portugal. Beers you pay euro 2 or less for elsewhere are triple here and food you pay as much or more for as in i.e. Manhattan’s hip areas. Sure is a tourist trap compared to the Average Portugal!,1
Aggressive security,"The security was really aggressive and pushing me to go out. It’s a place that I don’t recommend because the security is agressivo me. Very bad place to go, don’t go to this trap. Don’t trust on the security.",1
"tourist factory, to escape.","noisy place. very expensive . “international” cuisine, not specifically Portuguese.
a few young, trendy Portuguese people are taking a chance. Other cheaper restaurants away.
We are disappointed following the positive reviews on the forums. This has nothing to do with the food courts in Singapore for example...",2
Very expensive and bad,"Expensive and boring experience
Many stalls closed and the food generally boring
Probably won't come back
Otherwise, the basis for it to be really good",1
Found the prices very high 9 euro for one sardine on bread. Not worth the price,Very busy as was to be expected. The food quality does not match the hype. Poor quality and over priced,2
We obviously don't get it,"Overpriced, overcrowded, uncomfortable, average food. This place is a nightmare, the icon photo on this site had to have been in the off season. The food is ok, some good, some terrible. All of it tremendously overpriced from the 12 Euro hot dogs to the fish and chips which were basically deep fried batter on a stick with the equivalent of Lays potato strings. We escaped with some above average pea soup and a pork pie that was cold in the middle. There are places right around the corner with quality food, real service for 23 to 12 the price.
Ambience 1 - eating shoulder to shoulder, so loud it might as well have been a concert
Food 4 - just ok, being ""innovative"" doesn't mean good
Value 0 - too expensive",2
Good food but pricy and hipster AF,"Great food, sure, but you can find great food basically everywhere in Lisbon. If you like the authentic vibe of a market, don't come here. Basically, there are only irritating hipster tourists and the stalls are all identical. It is a modular series of food vendors that has nothing of the real beauty of an ancient covered market.",2
POOR AIR CONDITIONING,"We visited here late afternoon at the end of September. The food stalls were interesting and diverse, and the central bar offered an excellent range of quality wines and friendly service. Our quibble was the poor quality air conditioning. It was 30c outside, and the food hall inside was uncomfortably hot and humid. It's not rocket science in this day and age to install large ceiling fans along the length of the mall to allow air to circulate. Without this we felt staying for a leisurely few hours would not be a comfortable experience, so we withdrew and picked up snacks and further drinks from bars along the river.",2
First day in Lisbon,We decide to have late lunch in the Time out market area. We came across Azul offering a variety of fish. The service was painfully slow waiting almost an hour to get our lunch. The fish platter was very good.,2
"Far too loud, too cramped and too expensive","I can't recommend this place at all.
It's very loud here - they play very loud party music so you almost have to shout to be heard. It's very crowded so you have to go around several times to find a seat. The most spoken language here was English - so it's a place visited almost exclusively by tourists.
That also explains the prices being too high. A burger costs €15 - octopus around €20.
If you know the other prices in Lisbon you'll know that this is a markup of almost 100%.
And the food isn't even good - lukewarm and not well prepared.
Unfortunately very disappointing

One plus point: the pastéis from the Manteigaria are amazing (but you can get them in different places)",1
we were disappointed totally,"we were there as a small group of people, with much confusion, a very hot hall, no sound panels, and prices same level as a normal restaurant where you have your how table. Tourists are managed as a herd of sheep.
I was told that air conditioning wasn't enough considering all restaurants were active so they said sorry and nothing else... I didn't believe it of course because it was visible that fans were switched off.
Also, cleaning was miserable and the table was totally full with people not giving is the place (after lunch) to newly arrived clients.
In Lisbona the services must do a great evolution as they are far behind.
Timeout is an English organization (also not so popular for its
stinginess)",1
"Overpriced, too stuffy and just not tasty.","Unfortunately, it's not worth it at all.
The food is far too expensive (average pizza Margherita €14), it's far too loud and the ventilation is also very poor, so it's warmer than outside. Unfortunately, you spend a long time looking for a seat in vain.
And if you do have a seat, it's not private, you're sitting opposite strangers.
In general, it makes more sense to just eat locally because it's much cheaper, more pleasant and better.
I wouldn't recommend visiting.",2
Lack of seating,The food looked great but it’s so over crowded and not enough seating. Visited twice and gave up both times trying to find a seat. Not worth the effort.,2
Poor,"High prices, very low quality. There is only the possibility to choose the food but then the rest is not at all good and plentiful. I didn't like it at all.",2
Tourist trap,"Go there if you want to eat in a sauna, wait a long time for your meal and pay thousands and cents for nothing. Definitely not worth the price.",1
No pet friendly,"Lugar muy completo para comer, pero no se admite entrar con un perro en brazos ni siquiera para poder pedir comida para llevar.",2
Worst food poisoning ever,"This market seemed super cool but, sadly, I got the worst food poisoning from a burger there. Definitely e-coli based on the symptoms. Spent 24hrs in absolute hell. Only afterwards did I see the food poisoning reviews. Proceed with caution!",1
Overpriced and overrated,"The market itself is such a good space and building! However, the prices are way too high for the food that you get. The options are very limited compared to other food markets in Europe. The food was okay but the prices for everything was too high. I wouldn’t recommend it personally",2
Perda de tempo!,"Pior bolinho de bacalhau da minha vida! Servido frio e duro no ""chef"" Miguel Castro e Silva. Fujam daqui. 2 euros por bolinho, horrível. Fomos lá só para experimentar pelos elogios que vimos no YouTube. Não se encontra lugar para sentar e não aceitam pagamento em dinheiro, só cartão. Come-se muito melhor em qualquer bar ou boteco de Lisboa!",1
Not worth it,"Overpriced, crowded, hot, looks like an American tourist food court. I can’t believe I actually wasted time walking here and coming here. Not recommended.",1
Attrape touristes,"Si vous avez envie de manger quelque chose qui n'a rien à voir avec le Portugal, et qui coûte très chère pour rien du tout dans votre assiette, vous êtes au bon endroit.
Une pizza Marguerita à 15,50, un burger 18€. On se croirait en plein cœur de Paris chez les attrapes touristes.
Je vous déconseille vivement cet endroit, faites plutôt marcher les restaurants locaux, qui vous accueille avec le sourire et qui vous serve des assiettes deux fois moins chère avec deux fois plus à manger à l'intérieur !",1
Condividi,"Il posto ci è piaciuto ma non è a mio avviso organizzato bene x la scelta del cibo, onestamente è un po’ confusionario ma è un posto con differenti proposte di cibo, drink e costi. Sicuramente la condivisione è l obbiettivo del luogo",2
Ristorazione da polli in batteria,"Reduci dal bellissimo mercato centrale di Porto visitato due giorni prima, il mercato di Ribeira è stato una delusione pazzesca. Un girone dantesco dal rumore di fondo insopportabile, dove i turisti vengono letteralmente massacrati da varie proposte culinarie oscillanti tra il banale e l'insignificante, il tutto a prezzi folli per Lisbona. La buona cucina portoghese è da un'altra parte (a prezzi decisamente più contenuti). Bocciato!",1
Overpriced and not worth the hype.,"We went here because of a recommendation. There is a wide variety of food available, but everything is extremely expensive. The portions are small (a few pieces of lobster and rice cost 23 euros), and the place is crowded. You will be lucky to find a seat. During the summer, the indoors become extremely hot, almost like being inside an oven. You should not bring your children here. If you walk a little further down, you will find plenty of places to eat better and cheaper food. It's a tourist trap. Avoid this location and the nearby park late at night because there are a lot of drunk people.",2
Giod food - super rude service.,Unfortunate that the food is so good - but the service is so bad. I’ve been to this market 4 times and each time had the rudest service. Not worth it. I would check out the other amazing restaurants in Lisbon with both great food and service.,2
Too Big Too Busy Too Noisy,"I just don’t get the hype surrounding this place, I seen many people standing or wandering around with trays of food looking for somewhere to sit down and eat. Sure there are plenty of eateries but that also means it gets very crowded.

Sorry not for me, too big, too busy and too noisy.",2
Not worth it,"Everyone talked up this place. But unless you want to spend time fighting over a place to sit, skip it.

We saw two grown men literally push a woman out of a chair because she got to the open seats first. And then another couple hassled a woman with a baby to leave after the person next to her left.

At least the beer was easy to buy.",2
Worst pasta ever tried to eat,"Tried Liberta for pasta. Pasta looked ok but to taste was hard (not al dente, actually hard) sauce tasted of nothing. And when I couldn’t eat it, server didn’t even ask if all was ok. Avoid this place. Expensive mistake.",1
"Laut, trubelig, teuer","Große Auswahl an Speisen und Getränke, Selbstbedienung, Markthalle mit entsprechendem Ambiente. Zur Qualität können wir nicht s sagen, da wir keinen freien Platz bekommen haben.......ist vielleicht auch besser so......",1
Just a huge food court.,"A giant crowded food court with zero views. I mean, this pretty much sums it up. We spent 30 minutes there trying to fight the crowds and left to eat at the real open air restaurant. The atmosphere there was like that in a big mall before Covid...noisy, crowded and the prices were on par with the top notch restaurants in Lisbon.",1
Not what we expected!,Very disappointed! My wife and I looked forward to visiting the market on our resent trip to Portugal. We found it to be much too crowded to enjoy and the food looked like bar food. Seating is very limited and on a day like we had it was quite warm. There are much better restaurants in Lisbon for much less! Made for a nice picture though.,2
Attrapes touristes,"Attrapes touristes mauvais rapport qualité prix pour Lisbonne et par rapport au concept du déjeuner sur le pouce… nous avons déjeuner au sea me au Susana félicitade ou l impression de manger un repas en boite, pour le bar à pâtes le service ne débute qu à midi pile le personnel de cuisine y est désagréable",1
"Bello da vedere, prezzi troppo alto!","Il mercato è bello , invitante e con prodotti mi auguro di qualità, visto i prezzi esorbitanti: della serie guardare e non comprare! È la classica trappola per turisti, mangiare al ristorante costa meno a Lisbona!",2
"Precios caros. 2.5€ por un botellín de agua. 19.90€ un filete. Está muy bueno, eso sí, pero muy caro","Había mucha gente y todo muy caro. Una hamburguesa 13.5€ y un filete 19.90€
Estaba muy bueno. Pero muy caro.",1
Not Bally,"No seats, pretty average, Ground Burger was a 6/10 at best, burger sauce was okay not great. Again no where to sit. Spent £30 on a meal, stomach in pieces not worth it. Better burger places. You know Byron Burger? That’s pretty good, basically the same for half the price.",1
para inglês ver,"caro e sem alma, bom se não tivesse nenhuma opção mas numa cidade com tão boa oferta não vale a pena perder tempo aqui",1
No lo Recomiendo,"No lo recomendaría.... Es un mercado con muchísimas opciones para comer, pero hay mucha gente, no es nada barato.. ni es cómodo. Muy orientado el turismo, recomendaría verlo , pero con la variedad y calidad de restaurantes que hay en Lisboa, no me quedaría a comer en el.",2
Verstehe den Hype nicht.,"Auf Empfehlung des Reiseführers und verbleibender Restzeit sind wir dort hin. Um es kurz zu machen. Gute Auswahl an verschiedenen lokalen Speisen zu teilweise sehr überteuerten Preisen. Es ist laut( bitte lasst kleine Kinder daheim) und Sitzplätze kann man suchen. Wenn ein Freund mich fragen würde, würde ich ihm sagen: Lass es bleiben und nutze die Zeit in Lissabon anders.",2
AVOID: Cafe de Sao Bento,"First visit to the Time Out market and ordered x2 Bitoque PRT from the Cafe de Sao Bento. Everything seemed fine, I paid and it was only when I checked my receipt that I noticed the operator had added items to my order which I hadn't ordered or agreed to. When I queried why they were on my receipt I was told that I had ordered them and agreed to them before I left the counter. Insisting that I hadn't ordered the items, the assistant decided to take back the food items from my tray but refused to give me a refund. I took back the unordered food after all I had paid for them and sat down to eat.
A group of men who had also ordered from the same stall said this was a common occurrence and pointed out that they too had items of food added to their order which they hadn't ordered, and did I know that the Bitoque that I ordered should have a small salad also...it was missing.
Staff at Cafe de Sao Bento are crooks and liars, happy over charge and not deliver what the menu says.",2
Very commercialised,"I appreciate that the market is the creation of TimeOut, but it still feels very commercialised and lacks an independent feel of other food halls around the world. The cocktail bar has some great cocktails that are expensive but in line with other capital cities. My biggest issue is that there isn't a single vegan vendor in 2023.",2
Tourist trap,"Do yourself a favor and stay away. Overcrowded, overpriced, and full of impolite drunk. Fallen over under the weight of its own past success.",1
"Packed, noisy, extremely commercial - no thanks","Packed, noisy, extremely commercial - no thanks. We did intend to eat here in the evening but popped by at lunchtime to see what it was like. I am relieved we did. There didn't seem any seats available on any of the very very VERY long communal tables, complete lack of any authenticity. Couldn't close to any of the kitchens to see what was on offer as the walkways were also crammed with people.",1
impossible d'y manger,que de monde...vous êtes collé les uns aux autres et impossible de trouver une place pour manger. Les prix sont plutôt élevés.on a même trouvé des éclairs à 6.5 euros!!! je pense que l'endroit est victime de son succès,1
Pretty average food at high prices,Order seafood pasta - very few pieces of seafood and lots of mediocre elbow noodles. Not worth the 20 Euro pricetag. Convenient and lots of choices. Traveling companions had 20 Euro hamburgers. Just not good value or exceptional food.,2
Ordinary market hall,Whilst maybe a cool place to see we weren’t very much amazed but what was for offer. Definitely can find better places elsewhere,2
Incompréhensible!,"Après avoir mangé un excellent alfeijado, nous n’avons pu rien commander d’autre. Même pas un café ou un dessert. Il n’était pourtant que 13h55 et tous les stands fermaient simultanément.
Grosse déception de ne pas avoir pu profiter davantage de ce lieu et de se délecter encore plus de la diversité des plats proposés. Et le comble est qu’il nous a même été interdit d’aller aux toilettes parce qu’elles étaient également fermées!!!!",2
"ristorante ""O frade""","Entrato in questo market molto nominato in Lisbona, mi sono subito imbattuto in questo ristorante che all'apparenza sembra invitante, da evitare assolutamente, ho provato la tavola di formaggi ed il risotto con funghi, che era oltre che avere molto pepe, era inondato di vino che non hanno lasciato ridurre, pessimo!!
Única nota buona il vino Bianco fatto in casa, non male.",2
Végétarien déçue,"J’ai entendu parler d cet endroit plusieurs fois
Il y’a un assez grand choix de restaurant

"Lugar lotado, pessoas mal educadas e sem nenhuma organização.","Péssimo. Após quase 1 hora na fila para pagar uma refeição fui informada pelo caixa que não aceitam dinheiro. Eu disse que ia procurar outro restaurante e a caixa informou que TODO o Mercado só aceita cartão. Estou como turista, não trouxe cartão. Então ela resolveu aceitar o dinheiro e após pegar meu prato fui buscar um local para sentar e fazer a refeição. Só que não encontrei, as pessoas reservam todos os bancos e fui obrigada a comer de pé. Nossa ! Que pesadelo !!! Nunca mais retorno e nem indico a ninguém. Péssima experiência.",1
Chef Miguel Castro disappointment.,"We tried the tasting menu in the chef Miguel Castro e Silva place. It was 26€.
After waiting for 25 minutes we got the food which not only looked bad was
Inedible!! We were shocked to find out that in a place like this something like that was served. We will not comeback and will not recommend this place!",1
Confusione,"Mercato trasformato in una grande struttura moderna con diversi venditori di cibo, tutto molto confusionario e sovraffollato, offerta molto commerciale e turistica tutt'altro che tipica, code lunghissime.",1
Carnival party for children,"The idea of the carnival party for children was great, but the execution left much to be desired. There was only one inflatable mini, which was not enough for the amount of children present. It was practically a war zone – too many children, less space, and no one to organize! There were missing animators to keep the child entertained, and in the end, what we paid was basically just for the space. For the amount charged, we expected more structure and fun for the little ones.",2
Attention!!!!,"Bad experience not to mention the safety of the Titanic Sur Mer

My experience in this place was definitely negative due to the behavior of the security personnel. Instead of ensuring a safe and pleasant environment, they seem to act aggressively and unprofessionally.

I have witnessed incidents of abuse of power by bouncers, who treat customers with arrogance and, in some cases, with unjustified violence. In addition, I noticed a suspicious attitude towards some questionable activities within the venue, which raises serious doubts about the integrity of the staff.

I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend a quiet and hassle-free evening. Lisbon offers many better alternatives, where safety is guaranteed by real professionals and not by people who seem to be taking advantage of their role.",1
Worst place I've ever been in Lisbon,"We went with a friend to see XL Garcia on November 1 at 6 a.m. We bought the tickets on the website and arrived at 6 a.m., in a queue that never advanced. People began to gather at the entrance. They only let in the friends of the entrance guards, who were also very poorly educated. We were treated like cows. We spent two hours waiting to enter, crushed in the middle of a crowd of pretty violent guys. We ended up leaving because the environment was very aggressive. In addition, at the entrance there was an umbrella that began to fall on the people who entered. We'll never go back there.",1
The girl with the armpits,"I went in with a group of friends when we went to order a €10 glass or drink an imperial in a 15 cl glass or drink a white drink as thin as you can get, worse only 2 people serving at the bar, a girl and a boy and 100 people ordering a drink, and a girl in the middle of pouring the glasses stops everything and puts deodorant on her armpits right at the counter.
Very modern bar…",1
Desagradável,"The place is unpleasant, the girls at the bar are not
not professional and also super poorly placed
I'm not telling anyone to go!👎👎👎👎",1
horrible,The most worst bar bar in lisbon they want to sell glass and have bad staff is not good pl;ace.. tha forro band is very good,1
Horrivel,Horrível bar! Querem vender o copo além da bebida o que é prática criminosa! Alguém devia ensinar eles que quando você paga caro como é o caso num drink o bar ao menos tem copos decentes para servir,1
Not As Good As The Reviews Say,"I booked an airport pickup in Lisbon for 4 adults and chose a vehicle with 6 seats plus space for all our luggage. I received the driver name in advance and when we arrived at the airport, I messaged him twice to find him but received no response. At the general meeting point (for all airport transfers), I found my name and a few minutes later, a representative phoned me. She came to meet us and said the vehicle was at least 20 minutes away, so she secured another vehicle - with 4 seats - and sent us on our way. We were cramped and warm. Sorry we spent the money when an Uber would have been better.",2
Don't get ripped off like I did.,Take Uber instead. Hostess was rude. There is no one waiting for you with your name on a tablet. Waited over an hour for my ride. Another employee thought that was funny.,1
Don’t bother with this company …book an Uber!,Terrible service. The issue was with the airport security which took far too long but they were meant to wait 45 minutes and didn’t. I tried to contact them via the WhatsApp message they sent but they didn’t reply. They have ignored all other messages and just said they couldn’t come back for us so left my daughter and I at the airport to make our own way to our apartment. Wouldn’t recommend at all.,1
SCAM DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!,"SCAM DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!
I paid for this 3 weeks in advance along with another tour. I scheduled it for Friday morning pickup. No one even showed up, I called and they asked to pay cash and that I would be refunded for the payment I already made. Unfortunately they are now not responding to my emails, texts or calls. I will have to fight this with my credit card company.",1
PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING!!!,DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE YOU ARE OVERCHARGED AT LEAST 3X higher than UBER. It is not even a black car service just a regular car. Please don't waste your money with this service UBER is right outside the terminal and very inexpensive.,1
CANCELAM SEM MOTIVO EM CIMA DA HORA,"CUIDADO!!! Essa empresa não tem nenhum respeito pelos clientes e nem compromisso com serviços que prestam.
Contratei duas vans com motoristas em abril 3 (meses de antecedência) das nossos ferias de julho. Foi exigido pagamento adiantado de 4.500 euros. No segundo dia de serviço Essa empresa mandou um e-mail a meia noite cancelando todos os serviços. Ficamos literalmente na mão. Não pediram desculpas. Bloquearam meu celular. Tive muito trabalho para receber meu dinheiro de volta sem nenhuma indenização.",1
Worst experience in Lisbon - Avoid!!!,"Just had a message from our driver to write a review, so thought I would! What an awful company, would never use these again, so unprofessional and gave us such a bad start to our holiday.
Arrived at the pre- arranged meeting point, had to try and find someone to assist as it was an unorganised mess. Found our driver Mike, he told us to wait while he faffed around for ages on the phone. Took us off to the van, we had to wait another 15 mins while he went off to faff about a bit more, then he spent most of the journey on the phone, being rude to other customers.
We do like to tip for good service, but as it wasn't great, we just wanted to give a few Euros. I had some change, about €5 which I gave to Mike.....just to note, its about a 10 min drive from the airport. He looked unimpressed so my husband said sorry but he didn't have anything smaller than €20. Mike said it was OK, he had change. Off he went back to the van, came back with €10 then legged it with a) €10 and b) the change I'd originally given him before we could call him back! So he got a tip of €15 when we could've got an Uber for €6. We were so angry.

There are other issues with this company, but not going to go into that here.
My advice, take an Uber from the airport, they are readily available, cheap, the drivers are kind and cars are clean.

After that bad experience, I can happily confirm everyone else in Lisbon is lovely, our holiday was amazing and we will be back, just never use a private transfer company in Lisbon again!",1
Worst Service!,The driver did not show up. I even called the driver and he said he was at the airport. Very disappointing. I emailed the company and not even a single sorry. Very disappointing.,1
Poor,"Pick up was fine from Lisbon airport; ( 2 separate days, for 2 family members). When picked up to return to Lisbon, car sent was too small for 3 of us plus luggage. Car returned without us and we had to pay for an Uber ( which was able to take all 3 of us). I prepaid and no refund was offered, nor any apologies for sending a car too small. Funny as they drove us there knowing how many and how much luggage. A simple email to inform us o bigger car was needed would have been the thing to do.",1
Lousy Way to Start in Lisbon,"On landing in Lisbon I got a text from my driver, Nelson Leong, with directions and ending with the words ""see you soon"". Nelson bailed with no notice and would not answer several calls to his phone. We waited close to an hour for the hostess to find us another driver. Text exchange with the driver was complete with Nelson typing in a series of flip-off emojis, just completely unprofessional, rather than any sort of apology. When conveying our experience to the hotel, Top Tour management backed the driver and claimed I had threatened him which was completely untrue. I have kept the entire text exchange as the management denial was as bad as being left high and dry. If you have an alternative way to get to town, I'd encourage taking it. I can produce the entire text exchange as any response to this review by management is entirely predictable. As an aside, the hostess confided in us that the Top Tour system of assigning and providing drivers is a hot mess.",1
Take an Uber!,"Unfortunately our flight was delayed and then we endured an horrendous queue at passport control. All the while we were communicating with Marco Aulette, our driver to let him know the situation. He then messaged to say he had been waiting an hour and I told him we were on our way. Sadly a couple of minutes later upon getting to the pick up point, he’d already gone. I called him twice and he declined to answer. Another friendly driver called him (funnily enough he picked that call up) - told him he couldn’t wait any longer.

After paying £14 for that trip, we then took an Uber from the airport for €7 - more than half the price. Do not bother using this service, it’s overpriced and completely unreliable, and employs rude drivers.",1
Delays in bag delivery of more than 2 hours,"Lisbon airport is a disgrace for so much talk about tourism, having employees who don't cooperate or respond to people's questions, endless times for luggage delivery... a very sad business card. Very bad. Waiting time 2h and carpet broken...or...",1
Trip advisor failure,"Within minutes of booking our booking was cancelled telling us we would receive a refund in seven days.. no explanation. A chat with TripAdvisor could not explain nor assist us with rebooking. We took an Uber, one third the cost of trip advisor and easier with less hassle",1
Terrible service!,"I want my money back. I was stood up and the driver left without us.
I want my money back. The driver left without us. Terrible service.",1
Bad experience,"Our flight arrived on time, the driver sent us a message as soon as we landed telling us that he was waiting for us at the meeting point, we responded that we were already on the ground and were heading there. 10 minutes later we were at the place he indicated to us, but the driver was not there, we tried to call him without success and after sending him several messages he answered that he was with another service, after a long wait and asking him what instructions we should follow, 35 more minutes Later he sent us a message telling us that he could pick us up in 30 minutes. We undoubtedly told him that this was not a solution. Finally we had to take a taxi to get to the apartment.
I cannot recommend this service.",1
Never showed up for my airport transfer! No answer on the phone!,"They never showed up, 15 minutes late and were not answering the phone. They had confirmed the pick up the day before. Just be careful if you use them, obviously they can be unreliable.",1
Canceled by Toptour with no explanation. Be careful,"We booked this trip in July and paid in full; date of trip was 9/29/23. There is eight in our group. Received another confirmation three days ago and then today they canceled the trip. We noticed the same trip was available on 9/27/23 and went to book that but it now costs about $1000 more for the same exact trip.

This tour was booked on Viator. I chatted with Viator representative who said there was nothing she could do and to reach out to the company. I did email Toptour and still waiting for a response.

This is not fair or good business. I recommend you take them off your platform. With only days before we depart, this is very frustrating.",1
To be avoided,"Absolutely to be avoided... my flight landed at 3.32pm in Lisbon... We waited for the suitcase to arrive... We showed up after 43 minutes and he had already left, leaving other people stranded... I sent everything to booking .. They replied that they had tried to contact us but we hadn't replied... Which I can prove is not true.. However they didn't refund us anything and with this excuse they cheated other people. We took another taxi on site which cost the same... It's not worth booking it in advance.",1
Inaffidabile,"Ho prenotato con una settimana di anticipo e regolarmente pagato un trasferimento privato dal centro di Lisbona all'aeroporto per le 3 del mattino per 6 persone (4 minori). Non si è presentato nessuno.
Non ho ricevuto nessun avvertimento, nessuna scusa e nessuna motivazione.
Ho dovuto, in piena notte e in tutta fretta, trovare una soluzione alternativa per portare la mia famiglia in aeroporto.
Dietro richiesta, mi è stato restituito quanto avevo pagato.",1
Unpleasant concierge with visitors Canaries,"The concierge did not want to attend us in Spanish only attended in English and Portuguese very unpleasant with who comes to visit your city, we wanted to bring an image of Fatima but there stayed thanks to the concierge",1
Avoidable,"Nice view from above, Lisbon always deserves, beautiful bronze bells. Very rude staff, especially outgoing.",1
Give it a miss,"Suggests great views of the castle, but you can get much better views from a number of free viewing points. We were encouraged to walk around with the drink included and they even poured them into paper cups as we came down from the tower and pointed us in direction of the exhibition in the church, only for us then to get a telling off from a different employee in the exhibition for carrying our drinks. I’d definitely give it a miss.",2
Tourist rip-off,"If you want to buy an overpriced drink - the 5 Euro entrance fee includes a drink - then it's OK. However, if you want a nice view of the city or the river, you should choose one of the other (free) viewpoints of this beautiful city.",1
Covered up for restration,"Unfortunately the beautiful tower was covered up and we couldn’t enjoy it.

We will have to go back in few years for full view, you could see through the cover now.",1
UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NOTHING TO SEE,"Obviously a very nice construction but to avoid because under construction. Scaffolding and nets are the only visible elements.

The park is very dirty like many sites in Lisbon. We are not yet at the level of uncollected waste or unemptied garbage only in Paris but we are not far...",1
Closed for retirement.,"Unfortunately the tower is closed for renovation. I didn't find any information on the Internet about it. She's surrounded by seats. According to the locals, the works in Lisbon have only a day to begin.",1
Disappointing,"Very disappointed, total waste of time. Tower is surrounded by scaffolding and some type of transparent covering. Also vendors walking up to you to sell jewelry and sunglasses.",1
"Disappointed, stay outside.","The historical side is indisputable but it is not worth spending 7.8 e to enter with a long enough wait.
The stairs are very small and apart from qq guns exposed, the rooms are not decorated, furnished or explained.
The site is overexposed touristically ...",2
Disappointment,The tower was closed for construction. Very disappointing. We took photos from the outside but wished we could have entered.,1
Wasted time travelling only to find site closed,Checked the website for opening times and arrived to find a handwritten sign to say that the Tower was closed. Nothing at all on website and no explanation. Not impressed!,1
A tail not possible to see nothing,"As there is nothing to see inside, it is better not to book in advance. We will avoid two hours of queuing and a quarter of an hour of visiting... aren’t the organizers able to issue half hour and half hour time stamped tickets to better regulate the flows?
It’s true that selling tickets without limit makes money ... but it’s no match for Portugal, a nation that has a reputation for being organized",1
Tourist trap!,"Dirty surroundings, unjustified waiting because nothing to see, queues accumulate throughout the visit, to avoid, nothing to see, just business!!!",1
"If there is a long queue, don't bother. Staff are useless",Long queue and ridiculous management of it. Waiting over 1 hr 15 mins. Managed to get in and 10 mins later was told to leave because they are closing. Don't be fooled by the 17.30 close time. The building is partly closed by 5 pm. The wait time was not worth the visit.....could easily been in and out in no time,2
Waste of time and money,15 euros to queue outside and then queuing again inside to see a view. Like alot of other people we gave up and left. So advise would be don’t bother going in. Do not recommend,1
Visit with buttocks,"Entry to the tower was not possible vs due to flood and risk of flooding the bridge to the entrance. It's not in any guidebook that this can happen. If you make ways of thinking away from Lisbon, that's not nice. 2 points because the tower is very pretty from the outside.
Please be careful, the taxi drivers waiting near the tower have ripped us off with the price. Please negotiate price before departure.",2
"Nice for a Photo, But Not Worth the Long Wait","Atmosphere and setting: A beautiful historic landmark with great photo opportunities. The tower itself is impressive, and the riverside location adds to the charm.

Tour/Guide: While the exterior is stunning, the long queue to enter the building makes it a less enjoyable experience. The inside isn’t particularly remarkable compared to the wait time.

Value for money: Not worth the time spent in line. The best experience is simply admiring the tower from the outside.

Comments: If you’re in the area, it’s worth a quick visit for a photo, but unless you have a lot of patience, skipping the interior is a good idea.",2
Prefer the Aperol spritzer option,"Ticket office is situated well away from the attraction so check the que length before you decide to buy the 15 Euros per person ticket (7.5 euros if youre over 65). We had to que for 1 hour in sun (no seats) - in July would be horrendous.
Once inside, you have the pleasure of climbing 92 steps which is a medevil tight narrow circular staircase split into 3 sections without hand rails and then coming down the same steps again. If you have any slight leg, hip, ankle or foot problem before you ascend then you will know you have one after your descent. Not for the infirm or disabled.
Inside their is nothing to see except the view over the estuary which is the same as the view standing in the que. A few peashooter cannons which I'm not convinced are genuine.
Overall a waste of time and money - far better to go and buy an Aperol sprtitzer and view the attraction from outside in the shade sipping your drink and ending up in profit.",2
Suffice to see it from the outside,"Fortunately included in the Lisbon Card.
We waited an hour at 2 p.m. on Sunday to see practically nothing. Besides looking out from an interior balcony there is nothing else, the rooms are completely empty. From the outside, however, it is very beautiful.

If you have it included in the Lisbon Card and there is no queue then it is worth entering. Otherwise absolutely not.",2
Watch the Tides: Do not take tickets in advance.,"If the tide rises, they close the Tower of Bethlehem without warning and do not allow you entry even if you have paid it. Many tourists were prevented from entering the Belem Tower with entry in hand by a rising tide. They don't warn you, and all of a sudden they stop you from entering. I do not recommend taking tickets in advance for this reason.
The outside of the tower itself is fine, but it's not otherworldly either. I can’t have my say on the inside because I was prevented from entering even though I had paid for it.",1
Wait times grossly underestimated,"Bought a ticket when wait time was 1H. I’ve been waiting 2+ hours & still a long way from the front of the queue. I’ve no issue waiting but if an estimate is provided, it should be sensible.",1
No interest,"From the outside it is pretty, from the inside there is not much to see. 3 small bare floors. The regulation of drip entries made us wait 2 hours for just 20 minutes of visit. Tourist friends do not waste your time, spend your way. For example, prefer the National Palace of Sintra, which is a marvel of architecture, or the castelo of San Jorge, which offers breathtaking 360° views.",2
"Outside a marvel, inside not worth it",The inside visit is not worth the 2-hour queue under the sun to get in. Beautiful on the outside. That was enough. Rooms are bare and small,2
Horrible and useless,"2 hours in a row for the cosmic nothingness, maybe the top floor would have been at least a more interesting view, but it is closed.
Time wasted",1
Torre de Belem,"Very long que and still had to wait when finally made it inside.
I would recommend visiting for photos if in that are but not worth the 2hrs to look inside!",2
Zero stars if I could.,"Not worth the wait in line. So many other things to do instead of wasting 2 hours of your life in line and inside. Views, even from the top, are unimpressive. No real cognitive history information.
Not worth your time and energy",1
A Long Way from ‘All That’,"I visited with my wife in October. A reasonably modest queue took 2 hours to clear for no apparent reason as it was no particularly busy inside.

Belém Tower is a gorgeous piece of architecture from the outside and I’m sure there are many interesting tales to be told about it seeing as it’s 500+ years old. Sadly you wouldn’t guess that is the case as there’s next to no information inside and all the space is empty save for the lower battery which houses some small cannons.

I love history and I’m happy to wait in line but this was a big disappointment. Unless the queue is very short spend your time in Lisbon elsewhere.",2
Waste of time,"Yes, do go there. But viewing it from the outside is sufficient. Spending 1 hour in line (around 70 ppl ahead), then more queueing inside the tower to find that only the lower levels are open to visitors, was enormously disapointing.",2
an endless queue,"Nice place but...
Management of the visit and the waiting poor or non-existent to choose. Ticket purchased but forfeited after 2 hours and with a minimum of 1h30 still waiting. We'll be looking at photographs from the inside on the Internet.
To be outlawed solely for this reason",2
Too long a wait,We visited but decided to to proceed when we saw the ticket office advertised a 2 hour wait for entry. We looked at the outside and were glad we had not bought tickets when we saw the poor people in the queue waiting for all that time in the blazing sun.,2
Not worth the wait,"It's a great tower to see from the outside. As for going inside, for 8 euro, it's not worth it. There's very little information and it's basically empty.
We made the mistake of waiting 2 hours in 30c heat to go in, please don't waste your time, especially if there's a long line.",2
Lovely BUT not worth the 2+ hour queue in blazing sun,While a stunning historical monument with some pretty views - the 2+ hour wait in a slow moving queue (they were letting about 24 people in every 20 mins) - with similar queues at the nearby monastery- AND more queues inside to get up and down between the floors make this a no go in peak holiday times. Moreover there was very little by way of historical information offered.,2
"Beautiful from the outside, but beware the line.","We got here 15 minutes after it opened and the line was already 3 hours long, in full sun with no shade whatsoever. There is no timed entry.",2
Attractive visit but lost half a day by the queues and terrible organization,"Lousy organization to visit the Belem Tower, which after going twice has been impossible.
Last Sunday we went and the Tickets were sold out, we had a Lisboa Card so the ticket had to be redeemed to access, when we asked for tickets for yesterday, they indicated that they could not be given in advance and we had to go the same day for the redemption which was no longer possible because of the validity of the card.
Still, we decided to purchase them online and so we did, the Reservation told us that the time was at 10 a.m. Upon arrival yesterday and after 20 minutes from opening, the queue was 2 hours and about 40-50 people ahead in the queue. Due to our limited schedule, we could not be 2 hours waiting to enter and less in full sun after 8 days traveling, waiting for buses that do not end up passing or that pass more than 30 minutes late and walking 14-15 km daily.
We have travelled all over Europe and had never found ourselves in a situation of having paid to not be able to visit something. The information and organization for this visit to the Belem Tower is dire and is a pity because the monument has appeal.
I've really felt ripped off and the staff is very uncut. I understand that space may be limited inside so giving a maximum time of stay inside and hours of entry for the visit would solve tourism to be able to organize your visit without having to go several times and with such long queues.
I have been to the Colosseum in Rome, the Vatican, the Eiffel Tower, London Eye and other busy places and the organization and information is much better and I have always been able to visit what I have paid for.
Finally, for the claim there were no papers, I have been provided with a post because they no longer had a claim book. The mail provided by the girls at the entrance of the Tower was wrong, consequently my opinion cannot be more negative in terms of organization and service, regrettable in my understanding in an EU country.",1
"Don’t go, had to stand for 3 hours for nothing","So basically we got and joined the queue, we then had to stand in it for for 3 hours! In 34 degree heat! There was a cafe witch was a 2 minute walk away, witch would be good but you can’t go unless your there with a good couple of mates to hold your spot in line. And after the 3 and a bit hours of heat and queuing, it kinda sucked in there tbh. Nothing to read that actually tells you about the place. There is a tour in there and some good sea views but other than that bit boring.",2
Trash all the guided Belém tours …,"Forget all the experts & secret tip of overrated & extremely expensive guided tours. Travel with your friends and/or family to Belém. From Lisbon the easiest one is the CP Train every 20min @€1.4 per trip. Talk a walk on the promenade between Discovery Moment and the Tower with plenty of bars, place to eat and music to listen too. Even on sunny hot days the wind will cool you off. Otherwise you picknick in the park in front of Monastery. You no doubt will have an enjoyable 1/2 day you will remember instead of wasting money on waiting. A warend … at least counts for 2 😜",1
"Poor visit management, flying!","The site itself is very beautiful, a beautiful view of the rear ""terrace"". However, a deplorable visit management to the point that we could not visit the entire site we were kicked out because it was time to close!!! Learn to manage your time rather than stealing from people... a shame!",2
Nice monument but do not buy long lines,"Belem Towers
The monument is nice to see but the place is just a tourist trap. Apps like Headout and others are selling expensive tickets for seeing this monument. But as tourists you can see it as is and take all photos you need and no need to buy tickets.
You can buy the expensive tickets and wait in line in the scorching heat for 2-3 hours, if you want to walk another 20ft and get closer to water and 20ft higher view. It’s just sad that which can be made available for free to tourists is being charged for same view. Very deceiving and waste of money.",1
Worst experience in Lisbon,"1 hour in line, in the sun. You pay 8 euros each adult to have no structure. It only comes in slowly, so you have to wait for someone to come out (as you can stay inside as long as you want), in order to get in. They should hire the boy who was playing the violin in front of the tower. He was ⁇ the highlight of the experience",1
Advance tickets don’t avoid the 2 hour queue. Not worth it on that basis,"Even if you buy your tickets in advance, you still have to join the queue which at most points is at least 2 hours long and in full blazing sun. Gave up so the tickets were wasted",1
BEAUTIFUL VIEW-WITHOUT INTEREST INSIDE,Very interesting from the outside. On the other hand the interior is very small and without particular interest. Nothing to do with it except a few bombs. Especially since the line is 1:30. So admire the site and continue on your way without wasting any time.I still don't explain the waiting management. A few people enter during the hour thirty waiting and then everyone enters at once?????,2
Absolutely not worth the wait. Avoid.,Avoid at all costs. We do not recommend unless you like to wait long in the hot sun with kids. First of all the workers told us the wait would be 2 hours but it ended up being 3 and a half. Security guard left mid job and we had to wait 45 minutes for a replacement. It was also very disorganized as the workers let random people in and people cut the line. When we finally got in it was not worth it with little to see and they didn’t even let us got to the top. There was also more lines when we got in where the employees were rude and weren’t paying attention because the they were on their phones and reading books. Don’t have any other activities booked as we got here in the morning and didn’t leave until 4.,1
Far too long queue and poor regulation,Standing in the sun for more than 30 minutes and not even in half pushed forward. We then decided to leave and saw that the traffic jam lasted 2 hours. Bad arrangement because we had to wait a very long time and hardly people were let in.,1
Top Level is closed currently,"Unfortunately, we were not informed when we bought our tickets that the top level was currently closed. If I had known this beforehand, I wouldn't have queued for an hour and I wouldn't have bought a ticket for €8.
When I was there for the first time a few years ago, the view from the top was very nice.",2
Overrated,"Travelled 40 minutes to get to the tower having bought tickets in advance . Waited in a long queue for half an hour and we didn't even move. Made the executive decision to not waste our day and left, and even as we walked away they weren't letting people in!",2
DON’T GO INSIDE,"Don’t waste your time by going inside!!!!

The tower is extremely simple inside - hardly any information to read or anything to look at. A nice view but not worth the waiting or money. Take a photo outside instead and then leave!

We queued for 1hr 10mins and you’re forced to buy tickets before queuing so you can’t leave the queue without wasting money. The system they have for letting people inside is incredibly inefficient as there are only a few people allowed inside at one time which causes the massive queue.",2
Disappointing,"We had reserved our tickets in advance, but once we arrived in front of the monument, we waited more than 2 hours. We didn't want to waste all this time, we preferred to visit something else.",2
Not to be recommended,"Absolutely not recommended, the visit is not worth the queue.
There is absolutely nothing to see in the tower, it is completely empty apart from a few fake cannons.",1
2 hours of waiting in full sun to at the end see a fortress with a few cannons of which there are many,Definitely not worth the 2 hour wait in full sun and low season!!! A fortress with some cannons!!,2
Way too long of a line,"The wait for this is ridiculous for what you actually see inside - the outside is much cooler. Once inside, it is pretty squished and slow moving (you need to keep lining up to wait to go up/down the stairs). Worth seeing, but not the best thing in the Lisbon area.",2
What a tourist trap,You have to queue for 1 hour to finally be able to enter. You see a number of cannons and you can move up 1 floor every 5 minutes. But on the top floor with the view? You're not allowed to go there!,1
Little point in doing,"If I had read the other reviews I would not have done this tour. Very disappointed because inside there is nothing special to see, the views are nothing more and there is even a queue inside to get on and off.",1
Manage your expectations,"Manage your expectation. Queued for over an hour., not sure what I expected but this literally is a tower with three identical empty floors and no information about the building and its heritage. To get to the top you have to climb 92 spiral steps. Save your money and time.",2
Not worth the wait,"Not worth the wait! Walk on the sand, by the bridge and take beautiful pics from there. The inside is empty and there is nothing to see. So annoyed with ourselves that we waited 2.5 hours for this. Cannot believe they only let a few people in as a few people come out. Surely there can be a better set-up.",2
There's no point in buying tickets online,"Terrible organization, we bought the tickets online, but when we went to visit, the line of about 50 meters that appeared seemed manageable, but after 1.30 hours of waiting and a few steps forward, we gave up. Entry was allowed for a maximum of 5 people at a time, with a wait of at least 15 minutes between one group and another.",1
Go for the exterior view only,Lovely building from the outside. Even with the Lisbon card we had a 2 hour wait. Best part was chatting with other frustrated but amusing visitors. Inside the tower is nothing exciting. Save your time and explore the Belem area instead.,2
Don't waste your time!,"Queued for 2 hours. The most interesting bit was the outside of the tower which we had spent all morning looking at. There's nothing inside, just bare walls and more queuing to go up the tower where you won't even get a good view out as the top floor is this empty, dark chapel",2
Great to look at but not worth going in.,"From the outside this is a five star attraction and well worth seeing. We bought tickets on line but were told we could not enter the long queue that day as it was shutting early due to high tide - come back another day we were told. That is not so good for tourists with limited time apart from the fact that it takes a bit of effort to get here from Lisbon. So turned up the next day and stood in queue for about 45 minutes (this was morning, queue may be worse later on). The last time we bought on line tickets, in 2018, we were able to skip the queue. So, first message is, do not bother with on line tickets. When we got in there was little to see - the best bits such as the roof are now out of bounds - glad we got there on previous visits. So great to look at but not worth going in.",2
so-so,"All that for this….
Queuing so much for a tour that is neither worth the price nor the time spent.
Unless you have the Lisboa Card and be there when it opens.",1
Belem Tower 4-15,"The tower is very pretty to look at from the outside, but there is absolutely nothing inside. The line was long and it was very crowded. Go to the Monastery instead.",2
No need…,"The tower is very pretty from the outside…. And that's enough! The interior is empty and uninteresting, especially since after an hour-long queue in full sun, you still have to queue on each floor, to go up or down!! No interest, look at it from the outside, it’s perfect!",1
A Big Disappointment,"We had purchased a Lisboa Card that advertises skip the queues!!. However, when we arrived at the tower there was already a very long queue. We were in the queue for about 10 minutes when a man came along checking tickets. He told us that we should have gone to the ticket office to get our tickets even though the tower is on the list of free entry with the Lisboa Card. The queue at the ticket office was also long. We decided to give it a miss as did not want to stand for 2 hours in line.",1
Bad organization,"It's a shame the organization isn't more efficient. Queues lasting more than 2 hours, which is even worse when we have children with us and the weather doesn't help.
They should sell tickets at scheduled times, which would avoid these inconveniences and the bad image of putting everyone out in the open.
Result, I bought tickets and spent more than 1h30 in the cold, wind with children and had to give up when the rain got worse.
God awful…",2
Disappointing in context with other things nearby,"Perhaps it was because we’d already done some other wonderful things in the area, but the wait was very long (worsened by the fake violinist right next to us) and the castle very plain…but we were disappointed. The single staircase meant many queues to ascend, and limited views from the window openings.
It was out least favorite visit of the day.",2
Total waste of time and money,Not worth the cost. Very basic on inside. Hardly any signs with information. You can’t access the tower at the top so views from the three floors is limited through the windows. Totally inefficient way of getting up the steps to see three rooms exactly the same. One of the worst attractions we’ve ever been too.,1
Go and see the Tower and Belem’s other sights. BUT DO NOT PAY AND WAIT TO GO IN THE TOWER.,"Definitely go to the Tower and take some great pictures outside and enjoy all the other attractions and waterfront nearby.

But do not, I repeat do not, pay and wait to go inside the Tower. This is for four reasons.

Firstly, the queue is horrendous. We arrived 10 minutes after opening to see the entry wait sign estimating 30 minutes. Ok, I know they limit entry numbers so fair enough I thought. One hour 40 minutes later at 11:50 we entered. And this was on a cloudy Thursday morning in February. I dread to think what would happen in high season.

Secondly, and more importantly, when you get inside, THERE’S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SEE. I’m not joking. Two small completely empty rooms in the tower with one small information board in each. Nothing about the history or architecture. And a lower floor with a dozen small cannons. That’s it. I’ve attached two pictures. If you look at these you will have seen everything there is to see inside the Tower.

Thirdly, the views are nothing special. There are much, much better vantage points along the river.

And finally, and which is not nice to recount, we found the staff inside to be officious bordering on rude. Once inside, there’s another queue to go up to the first floor of the tower. And another one to go up to the second floor. Despite there being so few people inside. The ‘guardian’ of the first staircase ignored the lines of paying customers politely waiting and just played social media posts aloud on her phone for 10 minutes. Then she deigned to let us go up. It’s not like there was anyone else already up there. Absolutely unbelievable.

So I say again. Save your money and, more importantly, time. Enjoy the exterior and environs.

Spend the hour or more you would have spent queueing in the Museum Do Combatente right next door, especially if you have children or want the potted guide to 20th Century Portuguese history (informative and succinct.)

But avoid the Tower.",1
Disappointing,"Purchased a ticket through the official website. Arrived to find that it was closed all day. I've emailed and called but am yet to receive any refund.

Aside from that, it's fairly unexceptional from the outside and there's a lot of rubbish and litter on the beach. Not worth the journey unfortunately.",1
scam,"We had bought tickets on the internet for a visit on December 31st, what was our surprise to find that the site was closed even though it was mentioned as ""open"" on the internet. What a scam!",1
To do but without taking the ticket for the interior visit,"Superb exterior but the interiors are not worth the cost of the ticket and the wait at the entrance and to mob at each level.
The belvedere is not accessible
The windows are not cleaned and do not allow photos to be taken from each floor

The exteriors and the history of the monument are however imposing and majestic and are worth the detour in the neighborhood",2
Disorganized and not worth the wait.,"Very disorganized place to visit and not worth the wait. Total waste of time. And by the way, if you have the Lisbon card, you still have to queue up at the kiosk in the garden to be given another ticket. I can’t see the point of doing the Lisbon card if then I have to wait in line for another ticket to get into some of the attractions around the city.",2
Not worth the visit inside,"As other people already mentioned, there is really nothing to see inside the tower while there is a long queue to go in. Also you need to queue when inside to go up a narrow staircase leading to empty floors (!). Just go up and down the rooms, you are not allowed to go to the top of the tower… Not worth a visit (at least inside) especially if you don’t have many days traveling in Lisbon",1
Not worth the tour,"There is no point in paying to go inside the tower. Basically nothing to see but square rooms- guests not aloud around the tower outside. Also - they only allow one way traffic on the spiral staircases- which takes a VERY long time. Take photos in front of the tower and save your money for the Jeronimós Monastery.
We have a new saying with the kids- on a scale of Belém to 10. Enough said.",2
Not much to see,"If you think you will get to go to the top, you’re wrong. You can go up about the floors through a tiny spiral staircase which in high season I imagine you will wait hours to go up. In each floor there is basically nothing and only one short description. The bottom floor has a bunch of canons but like the wire there is little description of anything. If it wasn’t for the queuing at each floor you could see it all in 5 mins. In high season it might take you 2 hours.",2
Very complicated visit,"Both the Torre de Belem and the Jeronimos Monastery are very poorly managed and create endless queues that tire you out and don't make you enjoy the visit. A system of access at set times is necessary, one cannot waste a day to see just two monuments. A very complicated visit.",2
"Disappointed, stay outside.","The historical side is undeniable but it is not worth spending 7.8 e to get in with a fairly long wait.
The stairs are very small and apart from a few cannons on display, the rooms are not decorated, furnished or explained.
The site is overexposed touristically...",2
From the outside only.,"From the outside the site is very beautiful. However, there is no point wasting €8 going up to empty rooms. Only the RZA on the roadway of the tower is worth it. The rest is just cramped stairs, waiting between each rise and each descent, in short, wasted time and money.",2
Not worth a wait.,"Awfully organized.
Staff rude and reluctant to answer questions.
Left the line after 30 minutes waiting and spoken rudely by staff.",1
"Waste of time, effort and money.","Don't bother.

Absolute waste of time and money. Despite pre-booking at a specific time slot, we still had to stand outside and queue for 45 minutes in the beating sun before we could go in.

Inside, there's barely anything worth seeing on the ground floor, at which point you then get to climb up a few floors inside.

And that's it. No rooftop view. Just a few narrow staircases and a view that, by Lisbon's standards, wouldn't make the top ten.

Don't waste your time or money.",1
Overpriced,"Not worth the $$$
Staff are unfriendly and not helpful
Spent most of time going up the stairs and can be challenged to average people. No warning and no help along the way. Be careful if you are not physically fit",1
Closed depending on the weather.,"We had met two couples who had experienced the disappointment of not being able to visit, one of whom had experienced the queue..., and today 17-10, it was our turn. The transport time could have served us to visit another interesting point, but it was once we arrived there that we knew that due to too much rain (and wind) the site remains closed...""A couple forewarned is worth it. two""!...",2
Lack of respect and seriousness,"We booked a free tour in Belem, there were 12 of us, we waited 30', under moderate rain, and the guide never showed up.
Buendia free tour, never responded",1
Don’t Trust Headout!,"I was in Lisbon for one day and saw online that Headout offered priority tickets for Belem Tower. They actually had me enter the date that I wanted to visit online.
When I arrived, the Tower was closed due to a National Holiday that day. I was disappointed but understood the error. I contacted Headout requesting a refund of over 50 Euros and they refuse to comply. Certainly they must have known about the National Holiday and should have never sold the ticket.
They told me to go another day as the tickets will be good for a year.
I was in Lisbon for one day! and have no plans to return.
Beware of Headout!!
Do your research before buying anything for them as they have horrible customer service.",1
Lisbon,"Don't waste your time! I imagined a huge deal, it was just a tower, with a huge queue to get in. And it's far away, take the train and go to Caiscais, it's worth it.",1
Don’t waste your time!,"What a joke. Bought a timed ticket on line for 9.30am entry and then waited in the hot sun ( no shade unlike the wait to enter the Nazrid palace, Alhambra) for nearly an hour. They let people in pretty much ‘ one in, one out’. I asked the ticket person about the point of buying timed tickets as it didn’t seem to make any difference. She said that it was a ‘mistake’ that they do it this way. We ended up just giving up and leaving! I sincerely wished I had read the reviews about the queuing prior to purchasing tickets!",2
Watch out for the tide!,"We booked our tickets online with today's date. Arrived on site, site closed due to bad weather! 35 degrees... In fact we learned that it's because of the tide! Rising... and the footbridge in this case must be covered... So be careful before booking! The response from the person monitoring told us that the tickets were valid for 1 year... Attention ⚠️",1
Look but don't enter,"We bought the ticket for the tower online more than a week in advance and arrived on site half an hour before the opening, but still all this did not save us from the very long queue of almost 2 hours that we had to stand in the sun and then complete the visit of a tower, pretty on the outside but absolutely bare inside, in about 15 minutes. The view is also nothing special. Walk past it, but don't waste your time (and money) trying to get in. Much better is the Ajuda Palace which is quite close.",2
To be seen only from the outside,The queue to enter the tower is devastating…. 2 hours under the sun for a 10 minute visit…. Where there is practically nothing inside... it is worth taking the photo only from the outside and avoiding wasting time... there is much more to see in Lisbon,1
Look at it from the outside,"If you can avoid it: looking at it from the outside is enough. Over two hours in line. Ticket to buy but without time reference. They let in 2 people at a time for every 10
Minutes and often there is no one to let in. Unjustified wait.",2
"Completely overrated, not worth the visit","The area itself is nothing special, a mediocre view. It attracts people only for the Belém Tower and the Dos Jerónimos Monastery which are borderline scamming: the only way to get in is to queue under the sun for 4 hours with the risk of getting sick. There's no point even buying a ticket online, the timetable isn't respected and you have to queue anyway. Some people felt bad and many refused to enter by giving away the money for the ticket already purchased. Thieves",1
Huge disappointment,"Don't waste time on the interior!
We queued for 1h30 under the sun for a total visit of 20 minutes (including the wait to access the successive stairs)
All this to see a few empty rooms, without explanations with just windows to certainly benefit from a beautiful view but what a disappointment
The interest therefore lies on the outside and the interior has little or no appeal.",2
The capacity is not commensurate with the people who would like to see it.,"Visit poorly managed.
The capacity is not commensurate with the people who would like to see it.
Many go out, many come in, but there is no pressure on those inside to go out. Result: 2 hour queue under the sun. But would a shed be so difficult to put up?
A mandatory path would be needed.
Not recommended.
Go and see other things in Lisbon, there are many...",1
Meglio fuori che dentro,"Posto suggestivo e romantico. Andateci è molto bello MA NON ENTRATE NELLA TORRE. Biglietto inutile. Soldi persi. Vi spiego: un ora x entrare; poi fila x salire ogni livello; perché la scala a chiocciola è strettissima e si va a senso alternato con chi scende. Tutto gestito ottimamente dalle guide, ma x vedere cosa? Uno stanzone letteralmente vuoto ad ogni piano! Una beffa se considerate che le prime due file le fate sotto il sole cocente.
Credetemi: il meglio è l’effetto che fa da fuori nel contesto del panorama in cui è inserita",2
Not worth the price,Felt like wasted time and cash really. The view from outside enticed me to find you spend most of your time there queuing to either get up or down it. The rooms are bland with little to no history/information and I felt I hadn't really got a grasp of the point of the tower.,2
Queue and queue some more,"If you enjoy queuing this is the attraction for you. Queue to get in. Queue at each landing within the tower. Queue. Queue. And queue again.

The viewing platform is halway up and the views over the river are nice enough. But not worth the queuing.",1
"Not worth the price, not worth the time",Only book this 9€-visit if you have one and a half hours of your life time to spend for three naked stone halls and a narrow stair where you have to spend your time waiting for the ascending and descending.,1
Attente …,"Beaucoup trop d attente pour pas grand chose !
On peut contempler le monument depuis l extérieur et c est bien suffisant.",2
If you want to waste your time queuing….,"This attraction was entirely ruined by their logistics. Even with having bought tickets online, you have to queue for up to an hour to get in. Then once inside, you have to queue to get to each floor (and there are four floors) - do the maths. We wasted 2+ hours at this place for essentially the same view from each floor. It’s not a guided tour, there are a couple of signs in English and Portuguese on each level. I wouldn’t bother",2
Inutile de visiter l'intérieur,"Je vous conseille de faire une photo de la tour et de faire autre chose
On a fait 1h30 de queu au total pour visiter une tour vide ( queue a l'entrée, queue premier étage, queue deuxième et queue queue tout le temps) on avait qu'une envie c'était de s'échapper de cette tour
Y a d'autres choses plus intéressantes
Ce n'est que mon avis bien-sûr",1
If you have a life to waste …,"If you have time to waste, queue here. Because you queue for tickets, queue to get in, queue on the first floor to get to the second floor … and even if you decide you’ve had enough - you have to queue to get out. My advice? Definitely read up about it, go and admire from the outside, take pics and then don’t waste your life, queuing.",2
Dommage,"Après une attente de 45 min, alors qu’on a payé pour un coupe-file, on nous dit que le billet n’est pas valable et qu’ils ne connaissent pas tripadvisor… donc on n’a pas pu y rentrer",1
Insegurança,A história é muito boa. Mas as escadas são muito estreitas e o piso desgastado! Um funcionário comentou que não é permitido ter corrimão pois no passado não havia tal apoio. Concordo. Só que era usado por guardas e as pedras dos degraus não estavam lisas.,1
Belem inefficient visit - just have a look outside,"Very bad experience...totally inefficent organization! Other queues inside for every level.
No priority with Lisbona card, totally useless.
If you buy single ticket you can book the time schedule.
15min visit and 1h.30 of queues and we were few people waiting.
Better to see outside since inside nice view from the terrace.
Staff not friendly and also difficulity to speak english.
Just have a look outside and spent better time in old town",1
Not worth the visit,"I was very disappointed to find out that you can’t enter the tower. Don’t make the effort to travel all the way to here. However, if you find yourself in its vicinity, you might enjoy passing by.",2
Nul,Il n’y a rien a voir… sauf la foule… nous avons fait le tour en 5 min! Lisez l’histoire du site et restez a l'extérieur c’est largement suffisant,2
"Снаружи красивее, чем внутри","Башня гораздо больше впечатляет снаружи, чем внутри.

45 минут в очереди на вход, и потом ещё такая же очередь внутри для того, чтобы подняться на 2 и 3 этаж.

Зря выброшенные деньги",2
Do not enter,"LET'S BE REALISTIC: this is not a visit, it's torture! Queues to buy a ticket, to enter, to go up each flight of stairs, to go down each landing, to go to each balcony, to look through each window. An authentic procession where you spend the whole time waiting to see completely empty rooms. Access denied to upper terrace. Appreciate it from the outside, it's beautiful and avoid a wasted morning. Tourists are well exploited with 6€ entry :)",1
Pérdida de tiempo,"2 horas de cola para ver 2 estancias vacías totalmente, en concreto pagas para hacer colas, las vistas son las mismas que desde fuera de la torre.",1
排隊進去看空空如也的浪費,"建築物的外面是非常好看，但內部空空如也。不只是進去塔內需要排隊，差不多一個小時之後進去每一層也需要排很久的隊伍，但上到去，內部根本沒有值得看的東西。寧願發多一點時間去看外面的漂亮建築。

The exterior is very nice while the inside is a little bit empty. The queuing time to enter the tower already very consuming, but you still need to queue to different floors inside the tower, which have nothing worth to see inside.

The queuing time in total composite more than 90% of the visit time of the tower. If we knew, we should save the money and spend the time to enjoy the beautiful exterior.",1
Non giustifica la coda,1 ora e 10 la coda prima di entrare e altri 40 minuti per accedere all'interno del palazzo. Bella ma quello che si vede all'interno non giustifica la coda fuori.,2
À visiter de l’extérieur,"La tour est magnifique de l’extérieur, cependant au vu de la file d’attente interminable je vous déconseille de visiter l’intérieur. Nous avons été déçu, il n’y a pas grand chose à visiter à l’intérieur hormis 2 escaliers à monter.",2
Très décevant !!,"C’est joli de l’extérieur, mais ensuite, c’est la déception…
On fait la queue énormément, pour ne visiter que des salles vides et sans le moindre intérêt historique ou esthétique.
Totalement nul.
L’attrape touriste par excellence…",2
Sort out the ticketing!,"Pleasant if unspectacular attraction. Needs to sort out how to buy tickets - great queue at (unadvertised) kiosk some distance away. One person selling tickets- some people giving up, so custom lost needlessly.....",2
A fuir absolument,"La photo extérieure suffit pour la carte postale : le circuit intérieur est pauvre ( rien a voir de spécifique), on patiente comme des moutons entre chaque niveau (normal, un seul escalier…on y peut rien la construction est faite ainsi pas pour accueillir des milliers de touristes par jour)
Il y aurait bien les photos de point de vue mais pour cela lisbonne dispose d’une quantité d’autres points de vue
Bref, à éviter",1
No,"You pay for the tickets and think 100 people in front of you will be quick. An hour wait, 10 people were able to get in. The guards twirl their thumbs and only let one or two people in. People are leaving the line. Sincerely keep your money.",1
too much tail,"queue of 2 hours and then enter and redo 3 other things to climb the whole tower, beautiful but also avoidable.
advisable to go in the week",1
Biggest touristtrap ever!,This was certainly not worth queuing up for 2 and a half hours. The inside is gwn completely empty. Don’t waste your time and money on this and do something else fun with your time. Biggest tourist trap ever!,1
Theft and mockery under the Lisbon sun,Terrible! Purchase of the ticket made days before online to queue in the sun for 3 hours!! This is crazy!!! We went go after an hour because they could not resist standing and the heat. Absolute fraud stuff!! Better to look at it from the outside but it's a steal!!! Shame on you,1
Penal organization,"Painful organization. Tickets bought online and - once you arrive - hours and hours in a row under the scorching sun, because admission is contingent on groups, with extremely slow entries. It doesn't take a genius to realize that maybe it would be better to sell tickets at timeslots to avoid this torture. Zero respect for tourists and visitors. Ah, obviously non-refundable tickets. Of course not.",1
That's bad.,"Bad management, mockery. Beautiful but doesn't deserve all that wasted time. People who run it rude and disrespectful.",1
Horrible.,"3h20 of tail, they make go back to the drop, and waiting in full sun, inside no explanation and no interest in the visit. Take the photo of the outside and enjoy other places to visit.",1
Overrated...,"Never again, bad management! Despite having the Lisboa Card we had to queue for two and a half hours under the scorching sun for a visit that lasts up to 15 minutes. Despite the endless queue outside, there were very few people inside the tower. They could definitely let more people in at the same time without letting them die and burn under the August sun. From the tower you can certainly enjoy a beautiful view, but it is the same as that seen from many other vantage points. My Recommendation is to just see the tower from the outside, all that waiting is definitely not worth it!",1
Just look,"Beautiful monument to see from the outside but the organization was terrible, too much waiting, more than three hours in line, no priority queues and what's more, everything was under the sun. The tower inside is absolutely not worth it",1
"Disappointing and exaggerated, certainly not a must see in Lisbon!","The Tower is one of the must-sees in Lisbon and was therefore also on our list. From the outside this is a very beautiful tower, which is located a bit on the side of the Tagus since the earthquake (before it was in the middle of the river)

We waited in line for more than 3 hours to get in and in our opinion it was certainly not worth it.
Inside there is a ""courtyard"" with some viewing holes, if you want to go into the tower itself, this is done in shifts. The stairs are so narrow that you have to alternately go up and down, and this is done under the supervision of guards standing at the stairs.
at their command you go up or down in a group.

In our opinion, the tower is overrated, very disappointing for us and we would certainly not do it again or recommend it. It's a shame that it is so strongly promoted as a must-see in Lisbon.",1
Beautiful even just from the outside,Another disappointment with Lisboa card! 2 hour queue to enter the tower and no advantage for Lisboa card holders. They could at least release an entry time slot so as to allow other visits to be organised. We honestly preferred to give up....,1
Eternal row,The eternal line… if you have little time it is not worth it. The visit to the tower is around 1 hour but it only took us 1:30 in line.,2
so much queue for nothing,"Perhaps expectations are too high, but after 2 hours of queuing to enter and an equal wait to go up the stairs, you arrive at a first terrace where the view is the same as from the adjacent terrace. The top floor, at the top of the stairs, is closed. The visit was included in the Lisbon card and was really disappointing.",2
Nothing special,"If you have little time you can easily skip the visit to the tower. Maybe you see it from the outside. Queue too long in the heat, it doesn't matter to buy the ticket in advance because there is only one queue. Nothing special.",1
Absolutely not. I do not recommend. Overrated.,"WASTED day: thanks to the disorganization of the Lisbon administration we waited to enter for more than 3 hours under the scorching sun, causing a first degree burn. To see something that can be found anywhere. Buying tickets before leaving was of no use since the entrances are not managed nor scheduled. They tell you you will wait for 2 hours but then it's 4. Unacceptable.",1
No vale la pena pagar,"9€ la entrada para ver la torre vacia, las misma vistas que desde fuera, los controladores muy desagrables, no puedes salir cuando quieres, tu imoa que llamar a la policia por los gritos de los dos energumenos que tienen alli. Engaño total.por fuera preciosa hacer la foto y poco mas.",2
WAIST OF TIME,"This might be the biggest waist of time in Lissabon. The belem Tower i very beautiful from the out side but that is it, I will only say this ones DO NOT GO INSIDE, we spend about an hour getting tickets and getting in, ones inside we saw the artillery room where a couple of Canon stood, and there were little to no historical information, afterwards we went upstairs to see the tower it self, there we stood in line for an additional 25 minutes just to get in side. When we finally got in we walked in a room witch had almost nothing to see the we stood in line for another 10-15 minutes to get to the next room and we did that for three rooms in a row. But we staid because we thought it would be worth it to get to the top of the tower and enjoy the view... To our surprise, we couldn't even get to the top, we got to the third room and saw that the stairways to the top were closed for visitors. All in all gaint disappointment, and wouldn't recommend it to others.",1
No merece la.pena entrar dentro,"Por fuera está curiosa, pero la cola de mas casi una hora para entrar...no merece la pena en absoluto por dentro. Solo fotitos por fuera.",2
Do not recommend. Failed to arrive. Dishonest. Expensive.,"Terrible - this is a company to avoid. They failed to pick us up for a private tour. Then blamed me for getting the wrong day when the voucher i sent them showed it was correct.
The tour was sold as private with an experienced guide in English. However, our guide had limited language, did not accompany us to any of the palaces and only pointed out some trees.
There are many companies that offer tours to Sintra from Lisbon - private lovely experiences - but this is not one of them. Avoid so you can have a good day.",1
Self-Guided Tour not up to Par,"The self guided tour did not meet my expectations. It was too confusing and hard to follow. I have used these in the past, but this one was nowhere near as good. the info was good, but finding the sites was too difficult. You had to have a working knowledge of Lisbon first for it to be effective. Even using my GPS, we could not find some of the sites. Eventually, we had to give up and just set out on our own. What is needed is better instructions and descriptions of what we are looking for. Also, you need to make it easier to reverse the journey as we were at the end of the tour when we finished an earlier tour. It was just not what I expected from my previous experiences with TripAdvisor.",2
POOR,"We thought we had a private tour with French Guide; now a taxi picked us up at our rental, which did not speak French but very nice.
He left us at the Sanctuary, and there nothing more. We called him as we had to know where the Guide was. And there the answer was no Guide the taxi brings you , it waits for you it is no other service.What a stunner, a car to go to the sanctuary we had one. We consider it a scam. We would like a commercial gesture of compensation for the absence of a Guide.",1
"Afrader, not worth the money","DE tour turned out to be different without communicating.
Booked was a small group tour in small bus with tickets to Pena gardens entrance. Didn't get all that. 54 people in large bus and DE Pena gar DE ns and palace were changed to visit an unbeautiful and small summer palace which was in the renovation, also internally furniture and paintings were in plastic. Furthermore, the e EN mess was gathered together furniture and attributes. The towns were little typical EN fully equipped for mass busloads of tourism The guide and driver did otherwise excellent",2
"Not a small group, but full of big buses","The tour should have a maximum of 16 people. In the end there were 27 - there would have been over 30, but some couldn't find their way to the departure meeting point. We booked the tour especially because of the small group size and that was not fulfilled. The bus was large and full, there was a continuous sound system from the tour guide and the palace in Sintra and also Cascais were simply overflowing.
The guide in itself was good and everything was driven off, but we didn't get what we booked.",2
Terrible travel agency,I lost the tour. We were at the meeting point at 8:10 and we never found the driver. We pretended to contact him for 1 hour and a sleeping gentleman answered. He told us to go to Sintra with Uber and find the rest of the team. We went again. The team was gone. Unacceptable and unprofessional behavior. I don't recommend it to anyone.,1
Sent to wrong location and missed tour.,"We booked on a Sunday for a Monday tour and arrived 15 mins early at designated location of Praça Dom Pedro IV ( a large statue) We received a message at 0810 that tour had departed and that we were not at correct location of a Starbucks which was across the street. Am guessing that operator may had emailed all other guests with updated meetup point but since we booked late we were not included in email.
I see that TripAdvisor meetup location for this tour has now been updated to reflect Starbucks location.
Disappointed to have missed this tour, more disappointed that operator only sent message after tour had departed, and not before as we were only across the street.",1
Lack of communication,"According to a misunderstanding which could be fixed if the tour guide would have informed us by calling instead of emailing, caused us to miss the tour, even if we were 2 min walk away from the meeting point at the time of 8:05. So I would not recommend this tour since they would not try to reach their customers in case of that kind of situations. They did not give proper reaction at the proper time.",1
"John and Daniel of Civitatis are unpresentable, ill-educated and devoid of all empathy to their neighbors.","On 6/12/24 we had a free walking tour of Sintra with Civitatis. We made two separate reservations with different names, in total it was a 6 person reservation, and the other reservation for 2 people, that is, we had confirmation of both reservations in two different mails. At the meeting point we were poorly received by a certain Juan who asked us how many we were, we answered that 8 people, ipsofacto replied to us in bad manners that groups of 8 were not allowed and his last words were stoned saying """"And I have nothing more to say"""". We tried to explain that they were two different bookings only we met there, we asked you on several occasions to check the emails in which Civitatis confirmed these bookings. There was no way for him to look at anything, because, he had us after him and did not answer us but turned his back ignoring us, we asked him to let us see his accreditation to check his name and others to put a review, complaint or claim and he reacted by storing said accreditation inside the coat he was wearing. We insisted to him until the moment that he became violent and threatened us by saying """"Not to continue looking for him because we were going to find him"""" in a defiant and threatening tone. This poorly educated, rude and violent character is not worthy of representing any kind of company through which he has to relate to the public. His partner Daniel, a Chilean who witnessed everything, initially did not mediate at any time, until a group of a total of 9 people arrived in our same situation, that is, with two different and confirmed reservations and to this group Daniel asked for their emails and there we already managed to get Daniel to do the same with us and we were able to start the tour. We felt helpless, ignored and abused by both guides, since, the second, Daniel, at the end of the tour politely indicated that we would not give any money, because he also did nothing to solve our situation and that it was as simple as having asked us for the emails confirming the reservations, this showed like Juan his bad manners and no education even telling us openly and hand aloud ""get out of here, I don't want to see them"""". Anyway Civitatis should take much more care of the selection of the guides he chooses to represent them, since, they gave us a bad day ruining our stay that day in Sintra.",1
Do not recommend,"Do not recommend. It felt like we had a driver instead of a tourguide.
Just rent a car or take a train.very professional and rude driver.",1
Disappointing Service,"To clarify, we booked a tour but weren't able to go because my husband got food poisoning the night before the tour. I suspect the tour itself would have been great, but we weren't able to find out.

My complaint is the service afterwards when we were trying to cancel our reservation and discuss a refund. After a number of phone calls I was able to reach someone and he assured me that he'd process our refund when he returned to the office (he was currently leading another tour). Since then I haven't heard anything from anyone in the company, nor have we received our refund.

I'm still hoping to talk to someone and sort this out but at the moment I can't recommend this tour company.",1
Irrespetuoso y falto de competencias profesionales,"El guía, irrespetuoso (me arrebató el teléfono para tomarme foto sin que se lo solicitara) ,sin una camioneta funcional (sin cinturones de seguridad, sucia y sin aire acondicionado adecuado) , con errores en la narrativa histórica (datos falsos y fuentes no confiables) sin control emocional (nos enteramos de problemas personales y divorcio) y sin yo escribirle antes un comentario hizo alusión en una retro en inglés no mía que era yo quien le escribía cuando eso es imposible dado que no sé inglés, en ese comentario de manera sutil me ofende utilizando mi físico como excusa, lamentable, por eso me tomo el tiempo le retroalimentarlo objetivamente dejando al lado su físico que de igual forma podría ser criticable",1
Didn’t meet what I expected,"Joaquim Lopes was a kind person. Nevertheless, when I purchased the trip it was promoted as being given in Spanish, it wasn’t, he offered to translate from English to Spanish, but the time made it impossible to have the same quality of information. Moreover, we were forced to be seated at the front of the van just beside the driver which made it very uncomfortable; we couldn’t even wear seatbelts.",1
Disappointment free tour Lisbon SARA,"Hello, I visited Lisbon for the 3rd time with my family and we took a free tour. We chose Tour of my live and we had the tour with SARA. We were very disappointed with the free tour, the worst I have ever done without a doubt and I have done quite a few. It skipped super important things about the city of Lisbon and didn't tell anything of interest, only history, which made it very boring and boring. Very sad and disappointed, I would not do it with them again and that is why I write this review so that no one wastes their time and the same thing happens to them. I hope it helps you Carmen, Granada.",1
Unexpected,"I had booked some time before I arrived in Lisbon, of course I had made itineraries. Just landed in Lisbon, the next day we should have gone with them around, I get a message with the cancellation because they had had an unexpected, ok, happen to all the unexpected but in this case it was enough to get replaced to not create inconvenience to the person who booked well in advance! Good thing I found guru walk who were super!!!!!",2
How to get plucked...,"Unfortunately I have to express my negative opinion about the organization: After a mishap for people who had missed the train the day was a succession of various unexpected events and failures because I believe that a group of more than 60 people can not be managed with only 2 guides, moreover wasting more than an hour of time for a break in the bakery at the expense of many other things to visit is very disappointing.
Spending 45€ so I do not think it is correct.
As is not fair the figure of 25€ for the extension to Cabo de roca and Cascais that is nothing more than a simple car ride without a guide (if I called Bolt or Uber I spent less than half... to know before...)
Thanks anyway for the preparation and explanations of the guides.",2
Not a good experience. Improvisation in its pure state,"That's a shame. 70 euros per person can also be spent but not in this way.
Two guides for 64 people, endless waste of time and management unexpected by amateurs. We stayed in a bakery without having typical products with endless lines (but why right there????) but the worst thing is to stay on foot in Sintra because there was no guaranteed pick up on the way back for everyone.
The only positive thing Antonio who illustrated Sintra in an attractive and interesting way.

Just an apology whapp is not enough for the inconvenience created today. That's too bad.",1
Nice but a little shallow,Cute but nothing memorable. The Guide nice and willing but the explanations a little superficial. Maybe the hot day didn't help.,1
I do not recommend this tour with this company.,"Pick up a few steps from my hotel. Adolpho the guide started us with Cabo da Roca , then the town of Sintra only 45 minutes, to visit 2 sites it is ridiculous. Then we went to the Palace of Sintra, very beautiful site but waiting 2 hours to visit the interior????? Then visit Cascais, dinner that I refused because no indication that we were having dinner in group and back to Lisbon. Ticket for Sintra not included but Adolpho the guide charged us 20 euros when we could buy a ticket for 11- to 13 euros,???? Next time I get an Uber, and I buy my ticket at the ticket office. I do not recommend this tour. Take a taxi and buy your tickets online and especially arrived very early.",2
Misleading Tour Company,"I booked a tour with this company on GetYourGuide and it was such a poor and misleading company. Never ever book with them. On the day of our tour, the tour guide Sara started off with a rude tone saying we are impossible to reach. Ok, but what’s with the attitude. Not even a hello first. Then when she said there are two people waiting in the car, I asked why is that when in the GetYourGuide activity details it says limited to 6 participants and she even admitted it too. However, when she called her manager, her attitude changed and became so nasty and argued with us. Said it is up to 6 can be book but it’s a van of 8 people. If it was for 8 people, then put limited to 8 participants on the activity details! Such a mislead and she kept arguing with us and saying we don’t understand. No, we understand clearly and we contacted GetYourGuide and they said we were right, that it should be only 6 people according to their website and activity details. After this whole ideal, why would we want to spend a day with this nasty woman and scam of a tour company so we canceled right there. We did a self tour and it turned out to be a great day and saved so much money and headache.",1
One of the worst for a supposed guided tour,The tour was advertised for an 8 hour trip in an air conditioned vehicle that ended up 9 1/2 hours with the air conditioning not working. The only air in the vehicle for 8 passengers were the two front windows partially down as the rest of the windows would not open. There was no mention of the excessive walking on cobbled streets/roads with extreme inclines. After 6 hours we stopped for lunch only to be told to pick the restaurant we wanted and be back to the non-air conditioned van for the return to our respective hotels. The host’s directions were not made clear and resulted in the group being separated causing excessive delays for every stop.,1
Avoid at all Awards for a Breakfast,"We had breakfast in this bar
for 19,90 euros, we had 2 americano coffees, 1 chocolate bread (not fresh) 1 kind of grape bread (not fresh) bread rolls (of course not fresh)
It was a Monday morning... it was probably Saturday leftovers...
Anyway, don't go.
Elsewhere it will necessarily be better and cheaper",1
Save your time,"There was no line for tram 12 compared to tram 28, although it’s kinda a pointless experience. You can easily walk and see the same sights. Nothing special, wouldn’t recommend.",2
"Tram wasn't running, wasn't communicated","Standing in the sun for an hour waiting for tram 12, but he never came. It was indicated on the sign though. Nowhere on the website did it say he wasn't driving. What a disappointment, especially for our 3 children, and what a waste of our time.",1
a real chaos/disaster public transport in Lisbon,"They do not meet schedules, they treat you like merchandise, without any respect to those who visit Lisbon and we make an economic expense in the city that is not much for the service that is received, the information is skewed or they do not tell you the truth, they lie to you with schedules the same employees of the service or they simply do not pay attention to you, a disaster, I recommend as far as they can, not visit Lisbon, let alone climb even tram, one of my worst experiences in public transport.",1
A disaster of service,"A tram wreck, they're nowhere near meeting schedules. The locals pay almost none. We've taken several lines and they all work terrible.",1
Didn't ride the tram,"On April 26, 2023 noonish, we wanted to ride Tram 12 from Martin Moniz plaza, but the line was almost as long as the block and you have to wait in the sun. It seems the line was for either 12 & 24 and there has been ""construction"" causing delays on arrival of trams. Ditched this plan in a jiffy and just went shopping instead.",1
Bof bof,"Excruciating driver, we wanted to take the tram to its 1st stop... after an hour walk to get there the driver tells us he stops halfway, all for 3.20 per person....
I do not recommend at all",2
Another tourist trap.. save yourself two hours..,"An endless queue to get you half an hour on Lisbon's iconic tram. Beyond the vintage aesthetic aspect, it is a public transport in all respects .. people get on and off like a normal tram (so it is also crowded).
But it does give you the chance to see a part of Lisbon that you wouldn't see on foot.. and you could easily do without it.. it's one of Lisbon's main attractions.. which is all to say....",2
Anti Climax,"Totally overated. Having experienced the 45 minute wait, and suffered the smirks of local taxi and tuk tuk drivers instructing their passengers to look at the fools queueing, I have to agree with them. An anti climax to ride in it. I was lucky enough to get a seat but in all honesty even with a window seat there is not a lot to see. It is a marvellous piece of history but as many have said, enjoy the sight of the tram meandering through the narrow streets from the comfort of a bench on one of the many viewing sites along the route. Judging from the route map the tram 12 does more or less the same journey but without the queues.",1
Blahh,I mean long wait to get crammed into a can where you cant see anything very anoyed driver not worth it. You can walk 10 min to the next stop to skip all the waiting by the way.,1
Too much waiting..... we're not done giving up,I can't tell you what the view of this tram is because we gave up to borrow it in view of the quest whatever the time... mythical but...,2
Attention! Electric 28 is over!,"Attention!
The line of tram 28 is off!
Due to renovations there is no more electric 28.. the journey is made only by buses and vans.
There are electric cars on other lines, with other routes!
Pay attention!",1
"Awful huge wait more than 2 hours, no crowd control terrible service don’t bother",We rated more than 2.5 hours to catch the tram literally we think there was only 4 running as we saw the same driver turn up. There was a queue of about 200 people right down onto the road and only around 20 people were able to get on each time. The crowd was getting very annoyed with the wait and the numerous people who just pushed in as there’s no crowd co trip either it was actually ludicrous I don’t know what we waited,1
Too Busy to Enjoy,"This was sold to us as a 'must do' tourist attraction so of course it was going to be busy however tI felt like they let too many people on the tram. We ended up stood up in the middle, not being able to see anything through the windows. We gave up after two stops.
There are lots of the traditional wooden trams in Lisbon on different routes. I'd recommend finding other ways around the tourist spots",2
2h20 waiting...,"What a great scam.
An impressive one leads us to believe that in terms of all the glowing comments it was a must-see in Lisbon. Like naive young people, we are engaged in this queue. After one hour the most lucid of our tells us whether to continue or stop. Always so naive we continue our queue which will last an hour longer to finally get in this car after 2h20...
Finally we leave to stop what 200 m further at a stop where this time no one was waiting, the first scam begins.
And it goes on and on every stop people get on we're packed on this tram. And in one fell swoop after 20 minutes of travel we are asked to go down the story is over. So effectively if you have more than 2 hours to lose queue like this band of french that we have been relying on all these guides recommending this excursion",1
Longggg wait badly organised,Massive queue. Very inadequate service to the demand . Badly organised . Would never do it if I knew it’s so slow as such to get on it .Tram itself maybe is good I guess.,1
Avoid,"Avoid. This is promoted as a scenic cheap tour of Lisbon, when in fact you will queue for hours to be crushed in a crowd and not see a thing. Really unpleasant journey. Hot, crowded, long wait, for nothing. Better to walk or take a taxi.",1
Bonde Lisbon 28,"Bad, they're slow to board and land. In line for hours and when the tram finally appears, the driver says that no one will be on board and that it is to wait for the next tram that never arrives. My first well in Lisbon, I do not recommend wasting all this time in the disorganized public service.",1
Mal,I don't think it's normal that after two hours of waiting and having their mother sit on the tram they'll be kicked out because it's not wheelchair-friendly first for not warning sooner later for not having it powered,1
More hype than highlight,"We’d heard so much about Tram 28 that we figured it had to be something special. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. Honestly, you can go ahead and cross it off your bucket list—we didn’t even rank it in our top 100 things to do in Lisbon.

After waiting over an hour in a line, we finally boarded … just a regular tram. Crowded, noisy, and constantly stopping to pick up more passengers. It felt more like rush hour than a scenic ride.

The atmosphere wasn’t exactly relaxed either. Between the warning signs and fellow tourists whispering tales of pickpocket legends, we spent most of the ride scanning the crowd, half expecting someone to lift our wallets while pretending to admire the tiles.

In the end, it felt more like a stressful commute than a cultural highlight.

Our recommendation? Skip the tram and treat yourself to another pastel de nata or a refreshing beer instead. You’ll probably enjoy Lisbon a lot more with your feet on the ground and your valuables safely tucked away.",2
Uncomfortable and unnecessarily crowded,"According to the main city guides, this tram would be one of the ""must-see"" things in Lisbon. We walked around many parts of the route, being able to appreciate (and photograph) elements that on board the tiny vehicle we could not even see in passing.
The only short stretch of the route in which we climbed, in the absence of free seats, we did standing, trying to hold on to the supports so as not to overwhelm the other passengers comfortably seated to consult each their smartphone, disinterested in everything else.
You know the old charming trams of Milan with shiny painted wooden seats and bolts? These Lisbon ones will have 2/3 the capacity, maybe even less, because they are designed to fit into the narrow alleys of the old town, whose rails must necessarily have reduced curvature radii.
The experience in my opinion is recommended only to true admirers of city public transport by rail. For all other tourists healthy walks are far preferable.",1
Tram disaster,"Absolute disaster! More than two hours of waiting. Timetable is good for nothing. Should drive every 10 min, in reality drive 3 an hour....",1
Tram 28 - not worth the wait,"Waited 1.5 hours in line, they are sooo slow to pick up and drop off!! We got on (having never been to Lisbon before) and checked that we could do the round trip. Got to somewhere where we had no idea where we were and the driver stated ‘that’s the end, all need to get out’!! It was dark and we asked him for directions back to main road, all of a sudden he couldn’t speak any English and would not communicate with us!! Be careful of this extremely slow and ends wherever the driver has had enough!",1
Not worth the wait,"Our travel guide wanted us to do this. We waited for an hour (3:45 in the afternoon in a Sunday) and got on the tram and went through the neighborhood. It was pretty, and the cost is great, but so not worth the wait. We could’ve started walking through the neighborhood on our own. Even if you don’t want to walk hills, there has to be a better way.",2
Waste of time and money,"We arrived at MM at 11.30am, waited 3 hours for the 28. What they don’t tell you….1. Trams run in a group of three. 2. 50 mtr line takes 2 hours. 3. The extra hour we waited was for the drivers to stop for lunch as we waited 1 hour before we sighted the next tram. 4. It is NOT a round trip, got to the half way point and told everyone to GET OFF and get in line again to get back on. 5. Drivers are arrogant and don’t respond to questions, they just walk away. 6. The 28 tram picks up locals along the way. Obviously run by the government or local council as it was appalling.",1
Account of the Vicar,"We waited for 50 minutes and appeared in the place of the traditional tram a mini bus that was crowded with a lot of people standing and a bad mood driver
We descended prox the Augusta street disappointed.",1
Awful,"This experience has made me question any other recommendations. We waited 2 hours at Martin Moritz … we were seated and they did not let anyone get on and stand. The next stop, loads more folk got on and just stood. They were the locals, not the dumb tourists like me who waited 2 hours for a crotch jammed in my back and tour of Lisbons waste bins. Total waste of time and energy. Just walk.",1
Bloggers and Influencers have killed this experience.,"Tried at 10 am midweek on a rainy day to board the tram 28 in Martim Monez, the start point. The queue was massive, working out the number of people waiting it must have been 8 car loads. Trams run to a timetable obviously, as one tram was pulled up short and the driver was reading the morning paper. So it would have been 90 minutes before we could possibly board. Goodness knows what it is like in peak summer months.",1
Never again,"Ignorantly we wanted to try tram 28. Time wasted. Terminus in Muniz Square, horrible. Column to take 28 and return. No chance of finding other means. At least you, avoid... ill-advised. Many angry people, no one expected to have to go down to a dispersed area!",1
The worst experience,"We waited on line for 45 minutes, which wasn’t the issue. We get on and after a few stops the driver told us to get off without any explanation. I find out through locals there are disgruntled employees that want to go on strike due to unfair wages (you can’t use the metro card to get on), because it’s touristy they want more money",1
Waste of time,"Waited an hour and half for this experience. We knew we would have to queue which is fine. However, when it came to our time to board the 28 we were ushered onto a tram that had been sat idle whist the driver went to lunch. He changed the number and destination on the front of his tram and assured the passengers that it was Tram 28. Off we went, looking forward to the , supposedly, 45 minute scenic ride. However, after 10mins he stopped the tram at Alfama and told us all to get off. When questioned by other passengers he just retorted in a grumpy manner that that was that and all off. What a total waste of a few hours.",1
Very bad experience,"We waited more than thirty and no tram passed from the terminal
No one notified people and almost everyone left the long queue more than 2 hours ago",1
Bad experience,"Bad treatment from the truck driver. We pick up the tram at Pça Martim Muniz dps from a line of about 40 minutes. I had already made this tour last year, 2023, and it was wonderful. This time, left Martim Muniz and the conduct left us at Pça Luiz de Camões ... did not take us to Campo de Ourique. I was horrified because, she was yelling ""the end"" ""finish"" and even yelling if she was speaking Chinese. Poor driver q pena q didn't mark her name 😀",2
Tram 12 is better,Waste of time. Only goes for 10 minutes as building new track . Route nothing special. Avoid queue and go on tram 12 from stop next to it,1
Avoid. Complete scam,Avoid. They are currently digging up the best parts of the route so the tram takes you a 10 minute journey through the worst parts of the city before the drivers rudly and without explanation kick you out in a complete dump part of the city. Incredibly none of this is explained when you buy the full price tickets. A complete scam. Avoid if you have any sense.,1
Incubo,"Crazy thing, more than nn now to make a very short route in which you see absolutely nothing typical or that deserves ! Waste of time",1
The Tram is a huge hoax!,"We did 1/2 hour in a row at 5.30 pm, the driver after making us travel 5 minutes by rail, unexpectedly stopped and let everyone off without specification or reason or offer alternative solutions. Other people had told us about the same problem but we didn't want to believe it.
The driver after taking 18.6 euros to make 3/4 tram stops after dropping us off and being obviously insulted without giving any explanation or any refund had remained sitting in his driver's seat playing video games on the smartphone.
INCREDIBILE!!!!
In addition, the little path taken does not offer anything tourist as it once did.
DO NOT TEND IT, ONLY INSURED!",1
The tram does not go through the whole route now,"Since July 2024 tram 28 route is only 10 min long as there are some roads constructions and the whole route is not available. It's not worth to stand in queue for 30 min-1h just to be told that by the bus driver. If you'd like to go though, watch out for people who do not respect there is a witing line and they just try to enter the tram without waiting (especially elderly tourists).

I am sure this is worth waiting when the whole route is available.",2
Not worth even trying,"I have read about this tram is getting quite packed and didn't have much hope getting on - when I saw the queue, I had no doubts I'm skipping this.
A lady in a queue advised they ran around every 20 min, not sure if it's true, we didn't bother waiting.",2
Queues...,"Like everything in Lisbon, the queue to ride this tram is longer than for most rides at Disney World. Don't bother, it's not worth it.",1
Deception,1h30 waiting under waterspouts for the driver to refuse access because we had a Chihuahua in a belly bag. Very disappointed as for visiting this dirty or disgusting city of your choice.,1
TRAM 28 EYE WITH DESTINATION SIGN,"OVERRATED.
If you want to live the experience of traveling by tram you have other options not to wait more than an hour and a half. You have to notice the sign at the head of the tram that tells you what the end of the journey is, since not everyone makes the complete line and you can find the surprise that leaves you three stops from the beginning, as we passed. We waited for the next one, which came full stop, we paid again and this one left us in Camoens, which is not the end of the line either. I would have liked this to be explained in the guides or some travel page.",2
Queueing for 2:30hrs for 15min tram ride!,"worst advice to go here...
2.5 hours queueing = 15 min tram ride!

road works shut off the full route. it didn't go very far, the tram was rickety and packed with people after the first stop (it is a public tran, not a tourist transport but it was crap only seeing one way out as the middle was stuffed with passengers)

the route we saw was fine, just definitely avoid doing this in October/November. or at all really

there's other trams to use, which use largely the same route!

1/5
terrible for families with young children

the queue started on the main section of pavement, by the yellow bins before the smelly bins. be warned it wasn't worth the wait",1
A NICE EXPERIENCE WITH LITTLE SECURITY,A LOT OF PICKPOCKETS WATCH OUT... PREFERABLE TO TAKE THE TRAM 12 IF YOU WANT TO LIVE THE EXPERIENCE... THEY ARE WELL-PRESERVED RELICS,2
Dissapointing,"Waited 2 hours to go on this, short half hour trip then it terminates in a totally different area. It is not a round trip, be warned!!!!",2
Tram 28 a tourist trap,The waiting huge (2 hours in advance) I was expecting to see a wonderful route.Neither even 20 minutes screw shit. I would suggest instead this overpriced experience and kindly say so. Take the 737 will take you to the same place in half time and leave you at the entrance of the castle,1
No point!,"No point! An endless queue, plan 2 hours of waiting! It’s nothing more or less than a tram ride like any tram in the city! It’s just a myth!",1
Visit to the ghetto,"After watching Michael Portillo in Lisbon we thought we must get the 28 tram . We waited for over an hour at 6pm and when we eventually got on it was crammed.
It took us to places that looked like the worst towns that you would avoid in your own country. I felt unsafe and was worried about where to get off . Please don’t fall for all the hype it’s really not worth it",2
Total disappointment,"The worst experience in Lisbon. Tourist trap.
Surely the 28 is an institution but make a very long thick queue (at least 1 hour) for such a short ride (because at Largo da Graca the driver shouted to us to get off... Is it the terminus?) without having seen anything other than city traffic, it was a disappointing experience to say the least.
Useful only if you want to climb the miradouro from Graca and Santa Luzia without making the piece on foot uphill.
A Tour Guide told us that tram 12 currently runs the same route as tram 28 (which is limited by roadworks) but we could not find the stop.",1
Cram The Tram sod the paying passengers! Avoid yellow bus tour,"We bought this tram trip as part of the Yellow bus 72 hours bus/ tram/ boat/ funicular tour/ ticket.
We queued for one and a half hours to get on a tram which was then rammed with an overload of fare paying tourists like us. Although we had a seat which is as well as I am disabled we could not see a thing as the isle was crammed with standing people whose rucksacks were basically in your face. It was an horrendous and uncomfortable experience! The driver threw everybody off at a stop we didn’t know. Tempers we’re frayed. Kids were crying and I am as aware of intricacies of the historic quarter as I was before my knowledge being nil. It was awful .it was unsafe! it was anxiety provoking and distressing. Advice is damn the tram avoid avoid and get a Tuk tuck more expensive but at least you will see something.",1
Waste of time,"Queued for two hours just to sit in traffic for an hour with an angry driver, you’d be much better off using one of the many tuk tuks",1
Feel like sardines in the moving yellow can,A long time ago it was nice to take the tram line 28 in Lisbon romantically and informatively. You'll have to wait in line for hours. We saw the long queue behind Rossio Square. We're not in this! Again and again the squeezed tram 28 passes us and we think of sardines in the yellow can.,2
Nehmt irgendein Tram,"Heute 3 Stunden angestanden für eine Tramfahrt ... na ja ...
Die Tramfahrerin war toll, aber das Warten hat sich nicht gelohnt.",2
Don't bother,"We rode the tram on a Saturday afternoon, maybe this was a mistake.
We queued for over 2 hours to get on the tram then the driver kicks everyone off half way around the circuit expecting you to queue again for the return part of the trip.
The tram was rammed with people, most were standing.
Yes it was a historic trip on a period tram but no way was it worth the queue or the discomfort on board.
This was the worst activity of out visit to Lisbon.",2
Tram 28 poor service,"Don't bother with trying to get on tram 28
The queues are very long and when the tram arrives it is usually full
The service is not very frequent",1
DO NOT BUY THIS TRIP!,"DO NOT BUY THIS TRIP!

This item is a complete scam. All it is, is a regular Lisbon tram ticket and a link (which ended up in the junk bucket!) to some kind of guide - which we never opened.... The ""guide"" that met us was just planning to show us the queue for the tram - and the 28 tram is always full!!! This is NOT the Red Tram - which we thought it was going to be. complete waste of money and it is not possible to complain to Viator or Tripadvisor.

DO NOT BUY THIS TRIP!

Go to the Praça do Comércio and find the stop for the Red Tram - which is a great ride and the audio guide is pretty good as well.",1
Tram 28 is overrated,"We stood around 1.5hr in the queue for this tram and it was over in about 30 minutes! We were gob smacked to find a local getting on no bother at all at stop 2…locals clearly know the best way to ride it! My advice, go to stop 2 or 3 or if you want a tram experience, get another one!",1
Disappointment,"Line 28 is the most famous in Lisbon being the oldest, so it is taken by all tourists, but our experience was very bad because in one of the stops that made the tram a Portuguese entered through the window and tried to remove the mobile that thank God we carried hooked to the neck, still left us the pull of the neck that left us the burn and the great scare, the best of all was that we notified the police, so that they were aware of these things, that is the safety of the tourists, but told us that they could not do anything that was usual, a very bad penalty and experience",1
2 hours I'm never getting back,"It was not worth queuing over 2 hours. Admittedly, we only joined queue at 11.30 so the queue was already long. After 20 mins on the tram, driver said 'end of journey; all off'. It didn't complete the full journey. Not worth it.",1
Too much waiting and little yield,"Waiting in the sun in the queue for over an hour actually made the experience negative. The problem is that if the activity is tourist, then to the ordinary citizen you have to give alternatives, otherwise, if along the way you make everyone rise the result, as happened to me, and have to go down halfway because you were all huddled and standing. Nothing was seen. Too bad!",2
"Do not bother, farcical but BIG TIP !!","Horrendous experience, queued for hours no info on routes on fares, most people think No28 tram is going to the Castle , it doesn’t ! It passes nearby and no word from driver to get off there . Tram gets packed so you can’t see anything. Suddenly arrive at huge roundabout and driver shouts “ that’s the end “ ! BIG TIP……..politely walk past mile long queues for No28 , stand by bus stop for No 12 tram three yards ahead of No 28 stop , GET ON No 12 TRAM IT’S ROUTE IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE NO 28 PASSES BY THE CASTLE AND ENDS IN THE SAME PLACE AND TRAM IS NOT PACKED !",1
Tram 28 IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!,"Do not waste your time and money! It is NOT worth the wait! We waited for 2 hours and there was confusion around tram 12 and 28 with no one to ask or share information. Also no consistency in the frequency! One tram 28 just waited some distance from the bus stop for 15 mins while the tourists were baking and melting in the sun!!! It became full pretty quickly. Another one after that did not stop at all!!! And finally we got into the next one, which just went narrow lanes with buildings on both sides for the entire journey except for less than a minute when it touched the coast line. It was an absolute waste of time¡!!!!!",1
All the fault of social,"All the fault of social media, alas.
Tram always overflowing and with practically no view.
If you want to get rid of the whim of the round well come, but otherwise forget it.
Unfortunately, the great videos on social media make you think who knows what, but you can avoid it.
It's nicer to see it pass than to stand on it.",2
What a disappointment,"On arrival there was already a huge queue waiting, unfortunately the queue only got longer and only occasionally a tram arrived. Because few people go on a tram we waited for almost three hours.
Once on the tram, the fun was quickly over. Halfway through the ride everyone suddenly had to get off because the tram didn't continue?
What a disappointment",1
Not worth queuing for …,"Act of self harm - we unfortunately got to the Martim Moniz Plaza set off point way too late in the day … 11:40am … and queued for 2.5 hrs to finally get on (!!). The ride itself was good - we had seats … but it then gets crowded after the first stop or two so you only end up with a one sided view. Fortunately, we sat on the left side of the tram so probably had the best of the view.

The ride then seemed to cut short as we stopped half way through after about 25 mins (at the Praça de Luís de Camoes) and we were all told to get off as the journey was over 🤷🏼‍♂️

Only way this is worth doing is if you get on early in the day or late. Not worth waiting in a queue for - life is too short !",2
Bad tram experience.,"I haven't had a good experience with the tram. Because nobody explains anything.
We stood in a two-and-a-half-hour queue at the iconic square, in full sun, and then got on board and watched them stop at other places where people didn’t expect much. You pay almost €3 for a fairly short tour. They say you see things but you can hardly see anything because the train as it stops gets crowded, which makes your journey rather uncomfortable.
The idea at the beginning is to be a tourist tram and not a public tram.
For me it's a hoax and a mismanagement of the ""town hall"". In the end everything is a saccharine.
So in conclusion of this experience is that do not queue, but go to any stop of the tour and take out a bonus that is cheaper.
From where the tram leaves you, when the tour ends, to the square where you take it takes 16 minutes walking.",1
Don't take it if you think you're gonna see something of the city,"We caught him for walking around the Alhama neighborhood and a mess. We waited an hour and a half in a horrible queue in the sun and then a lot of people started to stand and we could only see the people who were riding because they kept getting crowded.
It is rather a mode of travel as if you ride a bus but do not expect a nice and beautiful walk to see anything of the city",1
You can do without it,"He waits for hours under the beating sun to try to get on the famous tram but the wait is not repaid by the (short) journey. The tram runs along streets that are not suggestive and, given the crowding, little visible. You pay more than €3 to make only one route and then you have to queue and pay to take the return one. Discontinuous and badly organized service.",1
To avoid,"She's a scumbag. Very overrated. You should better see the tram from the outside at specific points. Getting into it doesn't bring anything. Crowded, no interesting views. Unpleasant premises.",1
The worst,"Dire experience, after waiting more than an hour and a half another catch it at no time report where you are and the very unfriendly drivers. You can take the tram 12 that the route is shorter and with less crowding",2
Time Saver Tram Ride or Time Wasting Unfairground Ride,"As you may guess, the tram is old and offers only so much comfort. Air conditioning? Try sticking your head out of a window.

It is possible to turn up on a busy day and find it oversubscribed. Not great when most of the country is in the midst of a heatwave. Also not great for those with limited mobility.

You should be able to jump on and off at any point, unfortunately drivers will not offer any common sense to the above, even if you join the tram before the terminus and it starts up 1 minute late. Rules is rules, so dont think you're getting a round trip, they'll tell you to go wither in the heat with the next bunch of bargain hunting tourists, or go seek more accompanying transport elsewhere.",2
Avoidable,"Overcrowded, hot, smells and afrori indescribable,... if you just can not help it take it at the end and not at rush hour, you have at least maybe the chance to sit down. Allow about an hour to reach the other terminus.",2
"Get a grip people, its a tram.","Seriously, do not waste your time. Queue was 1.5 hrs, crammed onto tram and couldn't really see much as like a tin of sardines in the tram. Got tuk tuk for 1 hour, same route, much better. OK iconic but needs to be put to rest now. Oh, it makes lots of money for the system but they still moan tourists take up seats. One or the other guys.",1
Terrible Tram 28 experience - just take a picture of the outside of the trams,"I will not do Tram 28 again. Over an hour long line up at the main stop of Praca Martin Moniz and a complete waste of time. They are supposed to run every 10-15 mins. Nothing really special about riding on one except that they do have an old world feel to them as they are all wood on the inside. However, they are so packed with tourists and locals (since they use these trams for their daily commute), its hard to appreciate the inside of the tram. The drivers are miserable sods no matter what type of transportation you take, as both the city but and tram drivers scowled when you get on. You do get to pass many attractions along the way, but unless you know what you're looking for, it would be easy to miss them. Plus the bus is so crowded, you're also watching your belongings for pickpockets. It's challenging to read the posted schedule as it's all in Portuguese and no one seemed to know what was going on in the line up. There were also no guides at the tram stop, which for a major tourist attraction, is unfortunate. I'm sure if they had someone directing people, it would make things less chaotic. We could have taken tram 12 to get to the same place, but didn't know that while we were there. Cost is 3.10 euros. There are tips online to what trams are the better choices and where to get on and I'd recommend checking these out before embarking on a Tram 28 experience.",1
Good to use to go to work or visit grandmother,"This is not a tourist attraction/ experience. This is a daily, common public transport like the underground/metro/bus. Stop advertising for something else.",1
"1 hr and a half wait, packed like sardines, can’t see out, my view is peoples midsection employees need anger management","Bad experience! The line was 1 1/2 hours long even though I arrived at 10:15. Ok. But…. After standing in that hot line that line, people rushed! I walked to the side and kindly ask the guy checking tickets could I please get a seat, I’m 70 heart patient. He said NO really nasty. I went back and could see all seats were being taken, asked again, he shouted NO! I managed to get the last seat that faced the center of the bus.
As the bus left, he shouted out, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN! What? I asked quietly and you embarrass me shouting and with a look of disgust!
It gets worse. They pack people on this bus standing and now you can’t see out in front of the bus or to the right! My view is everybody’s midsection! Unbelievable!
I try to take pictures holding on to the bar with my left hand and hanging my right hand out the window.
The lady driving the bus was so agitated when a car go in the wrong way down the street meant for the bus, she screamed and flowed her arms. I thought she was going to explode! This happened twice.
When I got off the bus since I was next to the last, I tried to tell the tram driver. I hope she had a nice day. She did not acknowledge, her fury was still boiling over.
Their employees need anger management And those standings should be limited to not obstruct your view. After all, that’s why we paid our money and spent our time for this experience.
If I could rate this a minus star, that would still be too much! My ride was June 18, 2024",1
To be avoided,"A delusion. We queued for two hours under the scorching sun... Left from the terminus... Went through two stops... Got off without too many explanations.

I would say to avoid",1
"Horrendous, chaotic experience.","Lined up in the morning where the tram begins to avoid the crowds, long after the trams should have been runnning.

After waiting 1.5hrs with the kids was told by a grumpy tram worker that they were cleaning the streets and he didn’t know how much more we needed to wait. Told us it was ‘our choice’ though it could be a 2-3 hour OR LONGER wait.

We came back the next day. Waited the long wait (approx 1.5hrs) and finally got on the tram. After 5 minutes on the tram we got to the top of a hill and the driver told us the road was closed ahead, and arrogantly stated we had to get off. We and all other passengers asked for our money back, he refused and told us the money we gave was for his wages and no refunds would be granted to anyone. He didn’t care, just demanded we get off, and didnt respond when we asked if he was aware of the road being closed prior to us boarding and paying. We had to get a taxi back which cost more than the tram itself.

Aside from this the queue is that disorganised locals and tourists can be found pushing in at every opportunity causing complete chaos and frustration between the entire queue.

Tried a 3rd time on the last day. Waited 45 minutes and didn’t see a single tram. The line was ginormous.

For us, it was nothing but a waste of time. The timetable states the trams come every 10 minutes. For a system that brings in so much revenue for Lisbon perhaps the Government should put their hand in their pocket and sort out their broken Tram 28 system.",1
JUST DON'T DO IT!,"Has some social media influencer rated this as a must do? Has the world actually gone mad and we're all coaxed into doing ""things we must do"" and if you don't you're missing out.

Honestly, there are loads of these trams in cities across Europe so Tram 28 is nothing special. In fact if you get Tram 11, which is less busy, it does the same route with less stops.

It was so crowed to the point that you would think there's no way anyone else can get on, but no, they just kept piling in.

You're lucky to get a seat so most passengers are standing....you won't see anything else other than the back of another passengers head!

To add to the whole pointless experience it's not a round trip...you're kicked off at the top of the hill and you have to wait and pay to get back down. Fortunately I don't have mobility issues so could walk back down but this would be a challenge to anyone who did.

I'm angry with myself that I was caught up in the hype around Tram 28. I didn't hear anyone say ""oh that was amazing!"" Everyone just looked happy to get off it.",1
Dramatically disorganized,"Stood in line for over 2 hours, many tram 28s that just drive by and don't stop. When they arrive, they first wait ages to get to the stop and then they leave the door closed for a while. Waiting in the scorching sun without any facilities is torture. The drive wasn't even worth it. Better to take an Uber hourly and drive the route (just as expensive if you share it) or just be in Lisbon for a few days and you'll walk past it too. Complete waste of time. During this waiting period you can walk the entire lap yourself. DO NOT DO THIS!!!!",1
USELESS,"You queue for two hours to take the tram, you're packed in like sardines (speaking of Lisbon) and you see practically nothing due to the crowding. Useless",1
Terrible. Avoid.,"Terrible! We queued for over an hour to be able to board a tram. Once boarded they became over crowded very quickly so you were unable to take in the city, culture and the beautiful views. There didn’t seem to be a maximum occupancy so it was an uncomfortable experience which we cut short and certainly would not repeat.
My 77 year old Mum and her Sister were yelled at several times by “elderly” Portuguese travellers who expected them to give up their seats and at one point, one lady kicked my Auntie.
Avoid! Find another way to see the city!",1
"Horribly crowded, bad experience","To start with the cost is very reasonable, we had the transportation pass and the tram was uncluded so it only costs us round 1,70 euros each.

However the experience was not even worth that much. There was not the sightseeing experience we had anticipated. It was really a tourist trap, at least when we were there, around 4:00 o clock on a Wednesday in April, not even the high of the tourist season.

We had to wait in line for over one hour to get in one of the trams, once in they keep on taking more and more passengers at every stop and it was so crowded you can only see out of your window, if you were lucky enough to get a seat. They kept on asking passengers to move to the rear of the tram to make roomfor some more and it was horribly crowded, body to body solid, We got off before our stop because we just couldn't stand it.",2
Absolutely insignificant,"This tram that you find represented everywhere in all the shops of the city really has nothing fascinating or particular about it, other than the old conditions of the carriages. Really little thing.",1
Disappointing !,We waited 1h30 and the experience wasn't crazy. The journey is not sensational. Fame does not correspond to reality! We do not recommend it.,2
Waited for 2 hours !!!!!,"Currently 11 15 am, been in the queue since 10 am. Seen 2 trams since we got here and probably another 45 mins based on timings. Don't bother",1
Just an old tram,"Absolutely not a highlight and massively overrated...
Just an old tram of which there are several in Lisbon with other lines that is not overcrowded...
Huge crowds because everyone wants to take a picture...",2
Better 12E in Martín Moniz.,"Not worth it. Completely overcrowded, it is still in operation by tourists. It is better to take the 12, which leaves from the same stop, Plaza Martín Moniz, you do not wait in line. At this stop, you wait for 12, in front of the entire line, not wait in line. The 12 makes a circular path, you sit down and you can return to the same place Martín Moniz for €3.",2
To avoid,"Crowded, no view, drivers as smiling as a Parisian taxi driver. In short, a magnificent tourist scam, for which we wait hours. To flee…",1
Overcrowded,"We spent an hour waiting to get on, it's very crowded and you don't enjoy it, they keep putting people in until we're all like sardines in a can.",2
For tourists,Very uninteresting experience. Crowded tram and no view of the route. It is much better to explore the neighborhood on foot.,2
Awful,"This is listed in many guides as a must-do tourist experience. We found it absolutely awful! We got in line at 10am and waited almost an hour to get on. The line grew exponentially behind us and I’m sure some people waited multiple hours to get on. When we got on, the tram traveled approximately 250 yards and stopped at the next stop. Apparently this is where the locals know to get on. There was no line there and quite a few people boarded. Among them were old people and a pregnant lady, so the men who had waited an hour in the tourist line for a seat, had to give them up to a local who didn’t wait at all. The trams go on the same road as the cars, so when there is a traffic jam, you just sit. And we sat for quite a while. The tram makes many stops and it gets more and more crowded. If you’re a tourist, I recommend doing a tuk-tuk tour. You’ll get to sit, you’ll get narration about what you’re seeing and you won’t be squished in.",1
Disappointment,"After a long wait due to the queue we managed to get on the famous tram 28. Packed like sardines we saw practically nothing. At a certain point the ride reached the end of the line and they made us get off. We didn't know what to do, but the tram only moves about ten meters and then we can start again.",2
Bad experience,"We took this historic tram to go to a viewpoint of the upper city, covering much of Lisbon.

It was not a good experience, although the tram is historic and very interesting, the driver was not friendly at all, it was very full so you could hardly see the places it passed, we ended up a little dizzy after a 30 minute trip .

Preferable to see them from outside or take another line that is emptier.

On the other hand, each €3.10 ticket is expensive for a trip of a few km, an Uber would have cost €1 more per person.",2
Chaos,"Designed for tourists from northern Europe or Asians and pickpockets from eastern Europe.

It's not worth waiting in line to get on it. It's also not worth going to the first stop and waiting in endless lines.

We got on at an intermediate stop to avoid a hill that we didn't feel like walking up. One stop and down. It is already validated for having gone on tram 28.

Seen from the outside, it is beautiful. Except when you see the typical ones hanging outside, we already know what they're up to.

Everyone notices it. So be careful with them.",2
A total waste of time,"I simply do not understand what all the fuss is about. We took this tram on a Friday morning at the end of February and had to wait 45 minutes to board; I've read that some people wait in line for 3 hours! Absolutely ridiculous and not worth the time at all. The first 20 minutes of the ride actually go through one of the ugliest parts of Lisbon - nothing but crappy shops, derelict buildings, graffiti and garbage to look at. Then it goes through Alfama, but we could have just walked there (and I wish that we had!). There are plenty of other cute trams in the town centre if you just want the experience of riding up and down a few hills; I would recommend taking a tram through Chiado instead.",1
Absolute scam,"I totally subscribe to Freddy B.'s opinion on the subject because it totally reflects my experience with that tram. After waiting for 1 hour and three quarters, a time that no one gives you back, we decided to leave the queue, as disgusted as we were since we were trapped for about 3/4 of an hour more and we finally went up the automatic stairs that are right there. sidewalk of the stop and next to the pharmacy. On top of that, the noise is that at the stop it indicated that the 28 ran every 8 minutes at that time. Worthy of a third world country.

I liked Lisbon and my idea is very positive, but I think this treatment of tourists by Carris, the city council or whoever is responsible for transportation issues is shameful and disrespectful. Many people ended up getting into one of the tuk tuks that sit in front of you while you're in line, who knows if it's all a municipal fix so that people leave their money in those vehicles instead of using a simple ticket.

If you don't want to get bitter, skip the tram. In the end, with the help of the escalators, you realize that it's not that big of a deal, unless you have health or walking problems. If I find out, I won't even consider the tram.",1
Fatal experience Tram 28 Lisbon,"A real trap for stupid tourists, it is incredible that such a system works so poorly in a city as touristy as Lisbon, more than 2 hours in a line of which more than 40 minutes no tram came, not even the 28th (which is the most famous) nor 12, an absolute disappointment, I DO NOT recommend them, don't fall for it! I am surprised by so much fame on networks and how they call everyone to use it when it is a real pain to wait in line at the Martím Moniz header, and the route is overrated, it is NOT worth wasting more than 2 hours in a line, They have to put more frequencies and not treat tourists so badly, the people of Carris and I don't want to imagine the chaos in Summer, first and last for me, very bad Lisbon in this, failed!!!",1
Endless waiting times,"A disaster, more than 1 and a half hours of waiting and then not passing. Any other tram in Lisbon is a better option to take it",1
"Not recommended, bad experience.","It is advertised as a panoramic and tourist tram, however after 30 minutes of queuing to get to the terminus and having paid for the higher fares compared to the other means of transport we discovered that at each stop dozens of people get on and off with shopping bags who stop standing and they crowd together, they don't allow a view at all. Unpleasant odors due to gatherings. Tested at the end of January on a midweek morning. Absolutely negative experience.",1
At the head of the customer,"To do for folklore, be careful if you do not speak English or Portuguese, the drivers are very unpleasant, even insulting, there was one on Thursday January 11, 2024 in the morning who made it clear to us and was not shy about it. say it loud and clear from the tram that we were having fun... not speaking both languages and that we didn't have the extra for the ticket,
It hides the image of the Portuguese",2
"painful, fatal, shameful","We had a pretty good plan, this tram ruined our afternoon and our plan, 1 hour waiting at least, a total disaster, it is true that the trams pass quickly at specific times but when they have all passed you just have to wait, wait, wait and wait until the next ones arrive

Seriously, don't waste your time on the tram, you can spend 2 hours in the cold waiting for the tram to arrive.

I didn't even take the tour so I can't talk about it, but you completely lose the desire to see Lisbon because of all the waiting time

If you have a plan to do the tour and you are short on time, don't do it.

A total shame.",1
Many waits...,"Don't waste your time, waiting more than two hours, you have to stand, the frequency of time is not respected, in short, don't even consider it",1
Don’t bother unless you like being herded and cramped conditions,"We had heard good things about Tram 28 but were sorely disappointed with the whole experience.
We joined the very long queue and waited for over an hour to be herded onto the already packed tram. The driver made my friend and I move from our seat for a local to sit down when she had already declined the offer of another seat.
It was a bumpy journey trying to hang on to the hand straps and not fall into anyone as the driver had so many passengers on board.
After 10 mins we wanted to get off and the driver wouldn’t open the rear door to let us out. If you are of a nervous disposition, please don’t ride this tram!",2
To be done but not under these conditions,"Tram 28 is an experience worth having in Lisbon but not under current conditions with queues, waiting, continuous disruptions. Like all the attractions of this city, disorganization ruins any type of visit.",2
Meh,It was a long wait and an uncomfortable ride. Views aren’t great. There are much better things to do in Lisbon.,1
Tram 28- dont do it!!,"Avoid this at all costs!!! Unfortunately had high expectations of this and definitely not worth it. Firstly, the wait to get onto the team was little short of 2 hours… very challenging if you have young children and point is not the safest and like many, we decided to head to the end point. Managed to finally get onto v a team standing. Could not really see much- team kept stopping for instructions. Probably better to ride one of the other lines for the experience. Buses are great and actually way more convenient. If time is limited… give this a miss. In the end, we got off early as it was not worth it!",1
What is the big trama,"We waited over an hour to get on in the heat of the day. We also had to stop people queue jumping every time a tram pulled up but thankfully most of the queue joined in.

If you have been in Lisbon for a day or so before it is almost certain you will have been to the places on the trams route. If you just arrived then there are many better things to do and the chance to walk the beautiful city is better than sitting being shoogled on a tram.
How this is Hidden Planets No1 thing to do in the city is beyond me. Saving grace was the daily ticket covers the £3 cost",1
Not a tourist attraction. Waste of time.,"This shouldn’t not be advertised as a “touristic attraction” or “something to do while visiting Lisbon”. I’m especially annoyed at TripAdvisor, because usually I get very good suggestions there.
It’s a tram line. That’s it. Never, in a million years would I (or anyone else for that matter) have thought about treating a Tran line as a tourist attraction if it wasn’t for all those reviews and suggestions online.
First of all, the trams are tiny and get packed to the brim, I’m talking London Central line in peak hour packed. No space no breathe, let alone to enjoy the scenery or taking pictures. This is a busy transport link amongst the central parts of the city. The locals use it daily to go to work but thanks to the overwhelming amount of tourists, they can’t even board the tram for hours.
If you are hoping to get a seat you will need to board the tram at the first stop, where you will find a queue 40 meters long. And you will be thinking ‘oh it’s not that long, this will be quick’ but it’s not, it’s anything but quick. As I already mentioned the trams are tiny and the drivers only allow 22 people in on the first stop (the amount of sits available on board). The trams come by every 12 min or so, therefore you will be stuck at that stop for more than 1 hour in scorching heat, wishing you never thought of doing this.
Finally, you get to board, rushing inside and take a nice sit next to an open window, preparing to be amazed by the great views described all over the internet. Wrong again!!! The streets in Lisbon, especially the one where the trams go, are very narrow, the buildings are tall and the tram sits low, therefore all you can see is the bottom of the building rushing by you, sometimes as close as 3 feet away. No chance to see anything that close or take a nice picture. You could stretch your arm outsides the window and try and make a video, risking a passerby to snatch your phone from your hand. Same thing goes for every stop the tram makes, you need to hold on tide to your belongings because everyone walking by could reach inside and grab your stuff.
The tram gets packed by the 3rd stop so you can’t see around you anymore, only out the window. And if an elder or disabled person enters the tram, you will have to give your sit up, because at the end of the day this is public transport and not a touring bus with reserved sitting. The sit you waited for more than one hour is now gone and if you thought your view was bad before, wait until you have to stand, because the windows do not go all the way up so all you see is out the window at this angle is the pavement rushing by.
If you do get to keep your seat you can make a couple of short videos when the tram turns to the same side you are sitting on, but that’s all.
The only good place on the tram is either standing right behind the driver, but they do not let you stay there long because the ticket device is there and people need to use it on their way in, or all the way at the back of the tram, but the exit is there and people are constantly pushing and squishing you on the way out, plus the windows there are different and the pictures come out bad.
Overall experience - terrible.
People who tell you they had a great time on that tram are either lying to you because they are ashamed of wasting 3 hours of their expensive holiday on that horrible experience, either have never been on a tram in their life…
The End.",1
ok i guess,"waited 2 hrs in the rain for this and definitely not that amazing, i’ve been on it before and previously it was much more fun. recommend going early in the morning rather than evening. but we did get a seat in the evening as they don’t allow people to stand when u board at martim moniz.",2
VERY BADLY.,"WASTE OF TIME. THEY ARE DEFAULTERS. THE FREQUENCY OF STEP IS NOT REAL AND WHEN IT HAPPENS, IT GOES COMPLETE.
VERY BAD MANAGEMENT.",1
A shame,The very long lines are a big waste of time. There are so many people that you don't want to get on the train 👎🏻,1
Nice but an odyssey,"I won't go too far in saying that the wait is exhausting because I saw the queue that was there. It's definitely a nice ride but I hope this review is useful so you don't find yourself in a situation like mine. I thought the tram would return to the point where I had taken it, but no. The terminus is in Campo Ourique where you either pay €3 for the ticket again by queuing again or you have to find out which bus you can take to return. Figuring it out on the spot was a bit tricky",1
Nothing special,"In other countries they would be exhibited in some museum, but here they circulate daily essentially only for tourists.
Except for at the first light of dawn even at the terminus you have to stand in biblical queues to get on (there are only 20 seats) and furthermore the entire interval of the journeys seems to be essentially at the free will of the conductors.
On board the ticket costs three euros (!), while using the rechargeable card half of the tax is deducted.
A good part of its route is carried out through very narrow alleys in a continuous ups and downs, passing over everything even to the side of where we were hosted: the rattling, however, did not disturb our sleep too much.
Overrated",2
Horrendous,"If you ever feel the need to squeeze yourself into a 100 degree furnace that's dangerously overcrowded then this tram is the very fellow for you. Waited for ages before it arrived. Got on, obviously no seats but surprisingly, no standing room either. Tram driver didn't think so and started screaming MOVE UP MOVE UP. She wasn't the most pleasant person I've ever come across. So, the rickety old box took off. People were barging into you, the whole think stank of BO and the train driver kept screaming. It was basically a large coffin on wheels. With a worse stench. Avoid and get an uber.",1
Terrible.,The wait was 2 hours 40 minutes. No one was managing the queue and locals jumped the queue. Some trams left with seats not filled. What a waste of a day!,1
Bad experience definitely not worth it,"Absolutely not worth it: unfortunately we didn't read the reviews first (serious mistake) and on 13 August 2023 at 12.10 we queued to get on tram 28 (arrived by setting Google map). The queue seemed ""short"" since it was no more than 150m. We only managed to get on at 2.35pm mistakenly believing that it was a sort of ""round trip"" but instead after a few hundred meters it makes a stop where NO ONE WAS THERE so if we had walked perhaps 300 meters we would have got on without queuing (obviously we wouldn't have sat down) and we would have avoided more than two hours of queuing.
The tour is very long (50/55 minutes) and does not go back but lets you get off at the opposite terminus where, if you want to return to the departure point you obviously have to go through the queue all over again and another 55 minutes.
Total? 4 and a half hours of time thrown in the garbage...
Avoid it or take it along the way (there are many stops and all without queues) to be able to say ""I got on tram 28"" but nothing more.",1
More than Terrible.,"Three-hour wait, chaotic route, I had very high expectations and it was a total disappointment.",1
Honte au tram 24..,"Je déconseille fortement le tram 24.
La personne aux commandes du tram 24 s’est arrêté pou ne laisser qu’entrer une présentatrice télé, et est ensuite parti, nous avons dû attendre 50 minutes supplémentaires assoiffés.",1
Presset af mennesker og voldsom kørsel,Det var meget sammenpresset som man sad og stod i team 28 og så er det meget forvirrende hvor de kører hen og ikke kører hen så det smart at spørge flere forskellige da de ikke alle siger rigtigt.,2
Sopravvalutato,"Viaggio da dimenticare tra strattoni, malviventi e aria irrespirabile. La vista è praticamente nulla e le persone “normali” si innervosiscono.
Meglio visto da fuori per il design vintage.

Didn't work for us....,"We went there but didn't have a ride, two reasons: nobody to give info only the people on line, and in a very sunny day it was really annoying to wit such a long line in the sun just to get on the tram for the adventure of it but not really for the info that the ride will give coz we did almost the same by foot. For those who brought the all in cards, still have to stand in line..... long line",1
Waste of time!,Waste of time. We’ve been waiting in line at the first stop for one hour and 20 minutes! It was over crowded and we couldn't see anything because people were standing. Better take the metro to get to city center.,2

"Nul, horrible expérience !","Si j'avais pris la peine de regarder les avis (comme j'ai l'habitude de le faire pour beaucoup d'activités), je n'y serais jamais montée dans ce tram 28 ! Nous avions visité la ville à pied les jours précédents, mais pour notre dernier jour, nous avions décidé de faire un tour à bord de ce tram soit disant mythique. Mais, après 50 min. d'attente, visiblement cela arrive très régulièrement, nous avons réussi à monter dans un tram avec mon fils de 15 ans. Puis juste avant qu'il ne démarre, une locale âgée nous a littéralement aboyé dessus en portugais. J'ai alors bien compris qu'elle souhaitais s'asseoir, mais au vu de sa gentillesse, je n'ai pas agit immédiatement. Cependant, j'ai tout de même demandé à mon fils de se levé et de s'asseoir sur me genoux pour lui éviter de rester debout. Elle a malgré tout continué à nous crier dessus et à postillonné en plein sur mon fils par la même occasion. Bref, malgré le fait que nous avions libéré une place, elle n'était pas contente et me poussait avec ses fesses pour que je dégage ! N'importe quoi ! Je comprends bien que c'est un transport pour les locaux, mais là, on s'et fait agresser d'une manière assez incroyable. Franchement, j'ai pas mal voyagé dans passablement de pays, mais je dois dire que je n'ai jamais vu autant de mépris. Mais cela aurait pu être encore une bien pire expérience au vu des nombreux commentaires de personne s'étant fait voler par des pick pockets ! et les conducteurs de ces trams ne sont visiblement guère très agréables.Nous sommes descendu après quelques arrêts car de plus en plus de monde montait et on y voyait rien. En gros, ne grimpez pas à bord de ce tram. J'ai vu qu'il y a des trams rouges pour le touristes. C'est plus cher mais j'imagine que l'expérience y est plus agréable.",1
Three hour wait in the hot sun.,"While the ride is neat, the trams only run every 30-45 minutes, not the 9-12 claimed on the various websites. So with 4 Tram cars sitting there none would take on passengers until 30-45 minutes had passed. This made the line to get on three hours.",1
Don't bother,"Honestly, I’d recommend booking an actual tram tour rather than trying to use this tram. We arrived 10:15am on a Monday and queued for 90mins to get on. However, we drove past it at 5pm and no queue, so perhaps try then! You can’t really see the sights if you’re stood up anyway.",2
Skip the experience,"Fell for the advertisement online and went twice to the starting point of this tram. We finally managed to take it but were sadly disappointed. It is crammed, not worth while and strongly overrated. Also it stopped halfway and had is all descend.",2

Mejor coger los autobuses de city tour.",1
Waste of valuable sightseeing time.,"Having read how this was a very popular tourist attraction, we agreed to queue, for over an hour!
And like buses, none came along, then 3 at once! Began to realise that the “iconic” number 28 tram was more of a public service tram, with many pick up stops along the way - than a special experience. It took quite a boring, non descript route that seemed to take forever! Uncomfortable too! There was no information given at all about the route, or which stop we were approaching. And then we were all told to get off at Prazeres (ie the terminus - that we weren’t told about ) and had to queue again to get on another tram for the return journey along exactly the same route. Needless to say, we got off at at the first stop en route back! Couldn’t go through that unpleasant experience again!",1
Tranvía 28 de Lisboa una desilusión,"La ilusión de tomarse un tranvía en Lisboa else me fue enseguida . A pesar de haber pagado el pase de 24 hs la disponibilidad de los mismos es casi nula .

Servizio pessimo.,"Peccato non poter dare meno di una stella.
Il tram viene dal passato e la sua organizzazione lì è rimasta.

L’azienda che gestisce il servizio ha trovato la gallina dalle uova d’oro ma come sempre in certi casi mi sentirei di consigliare cautela: al pollo ingordo scoppiò il gozzo. Pessimi, arroganti e sopravvalutati.",1
Waste of time,Don’t waste your time or money. Not much to see on the jam packed tram. Were made to leave the tram at the half way round trip and pay again to board another tram 28 for the second half of the round trip.,1

You stand in line for over an hour to catch a tram that gets loaded up to the rafters, you see nothing from the loaded tram, no commentary or advice from the drivers who are extremely rude.

Delusione,"Domenica 15 dopo 1 ora abbondante di coda, veniamo a sapere da altri turisti in coda che quel giorno il tram non avrebbe iniziato il servizio fino alle 13. I turisti in coda dalla mattina non erano stati informati del disservizio.
Il giorno dopo, di nuovo un'abbondante ora e mezza di coda. Finalmente saliamo. Al quartiere Graca di ferma e fa scendere tutti dicendo che più avanti c'era un camion ribaltato e non poteva proseguire. Andiamo a piedi, e del camion non troviamo traccia. Ripassando ore dopo alla stessa fermata, ci siamo resi conto che stavano ancora facendo scendere i turisti senza completare il giro.",1

On your head !,If there is competition for the worst tourist activity/attraction then this is a contender. Lengthy wait of over 1.5 hours for an uncomfortable and unscenic ride in an old tram through back streets. Then you are dumped off and have to wait for a return tram which may or may not take you where you want to go.,1
Horrible ! À éviter,"Très mauvaise expérience avec le tram 28 puisqu'après s'être levés tôt pour y arriver dès 8h10, avoir retiré exprès du cash puis fait la queue avec un petit bout de 2 ans, on nous a refusé l'accès au tramway car nous n'avions pas de petite monnaie pour payer les tickets.

Nous n'avons pas eu le courage de chercher un commerce pour faire la monnaie (peu sont ouverts à cette heure ci) puis refaire la queue qui depuis était devenue conséquente (1h au moins passé 8h30).

Une matinée de flinguée, et une grosse déception pour un petit bout de 2 ans",1
avoid at all costs,This is a real rip off and thoroughly unpleasant experience. This tram takes you to a far off suburb of Lisbon and you have to buy another ticket to return to the centre. You're crammed into the tram with the worst kind of tourist and you can't actually see anything unless you are able to hang your head out of the window. I got physically assulted by a fat German Hausfrau who wanted a better seat even though I didn't have one. There are better ways to experience the city.,1
Not worth the time,"Not a sightseeing opportunity. It's just a commuting line that's super busy. If it's helping you get somewhere, great. Otherwise, you won't see much as you wiz by, even if you're lucky enough to get a window seat and not stand. Take a picture of one, sure. But riding one is something you can avoid and not miss a thing.",1
Tempo perso,"Le guide parlano del tram 28 come esperienza irrinunciabile. Grandissima ca..ta! Lunghe file per accedervi per poi ritrovarsi in mezzo alla calca. La visuale è ridotta, quasi nulla. Se proprio volete provare l'esperienza, cercate qualche fermata più in la del capolinea, eviterete lunghe attese inutili.",1
Se volete perder tempo …da evitare!!!,"Andate alle 8 del mattino al capolinea, se proprio ci tenete a salire sul tram 28, altrimenti preparatevi a fare almeno un ora di coda, con persone maleducate che cercano di passarti davanti ( nel mio caso 2 turiste francesi alle quali ho rivolto paroline dolci e affettuose…) per fare un ‘esperienza a mio avviso poco interessante, a parte qualche curva dove sembra di urtare i muri delle case e un paio di discese stile montagne russe! Molto meglio gustarsi la città a piedi sia in salita che in discesa! SCONSIGLIATO come l’elevador di Santa Justa!!!!",2
Non ne vale la pena,"1h30’ di fila per fare un giro che a piedi avevamo fatto in meno di 2 ore molto più affascinante fermandosi in ogni posto tipico. Il tram a mala pena li vede da lontano, rallentato dal traffico. A conti fatti 3 ore perse. Salite alle fermate intermedie che anche se starete in piedi almeno non fate la fila",1
Delusione,"È solo tempo perso, non aggiunge nulla alla bellissima città di Lisbona, solo una delusione. Porta via tre/quattro ore al tuo viaggio e se poi sei all'impiedi non vedi assolutamente nulla. Fortemente sconsigliato.",1
Only worthy his you love to queue,"We were in line for more than an hour even though the line was barely 20 meters.
One tram departed every 30 min. If you don't like to queue this is not a great attraction.",1
Lang wachten op eigenlijk niks,"Overgewaardeerd.. Lang lang lang wachten, rijdt vervolgens aantal haltes waarna je eruit moet. Terugweg maar gaan lopen, geen zin om weer anderhalf uur te moeten wachten.
Jammer.",2
Tram 28....... niente di che!,"Parto col dire che Lisbona è meravigliosa e assolutamente da visitare! Una delle attrazioni più decantate e consigliate era appunto il giro sul 28, e finalmente dopo diverse volte che siamo passati davanti (vedendo code lunghissime al capolinea) decidiamo di fermarci, attratti dal fatto che le persone in coda erano veramente poche! Ma a tutto c'è una spiegazione.... un incidente d'auto poco dopo non faceva passare il tram sui binari, ma decidiamo comunque di fermarci visto che avevamo guadagnato un ottimo posto nella fila. Dopo circa 50 minuti sotto il sole partiamo e riusciamo a sederci. Le fermate dopo erano strapiene (ovviamente, era diverso tempo che il tram non passava per via dell'incidente) l'autista continuava comunque a far salire persone e chiaramente, quando si avvicina un anziano, non si può fare altro che cedergli cordialmente il posto. Risultato? Dopo quasi 1 ora di attesta, tram strapieno, in piedi e senza vedere neanche la bellissima Lisbona che c'era fuori. Io consiglio banalmente di visitarla a piedi, cosa che noi abbiamo fatto macinando chilometri in 4 giorni. Oppure per raggiungere determinati posti utilizzare la metro che è comodissima, puntuale e ovviamente veloce! Come anche i tram e i pullman. Questa è l'unica esperienza, che anche se caratteristica, non ripeterei a Lisbona.",2
Nulla di che,"È un tram, semplicemente.
Ci hanno decantato molto questa attrazione come assolutamente da fare, probabilmente ci hanno alzato talmente tanto l'hype che ci aspettavamo tantissimo.
Ovviamente da prendere al capolinea perché se no non ti siedi manco a morire. Al capolinea coda molto lunga però abbastanza veloce tutto sommato. Devo dire che non ne vale molto la pena... Sono rimasta molto delusa, sinceramente.",2
Not worth the wait,"I had an unlimited transit card and a little spare time my last evening in Lisbon so I decided to see what the hype was about. The line was extremely long. I was at the first stop so the line moved in bursts when an empty tram arrived, but there were long wait times in between. Tram 12 also loads at the same stop so once it started to rain I decided to hop on that instead. I was able to skip most of the queu and even get a seat on the tram. It was night time and raining so I couldn't see much out the windows. This may be a fun, unique experience if you've never ridden a tram car before, but otherwise it pretty much just seems like a really long line to ride public transit. I didn't end up making the whole loop and instead jumped off when the tram stopped near my lodging.",1
Don’t waste your time,Long queues and wouldn’t recommend. The main sights are in the city centre and within walking distance. I would not waste your time doing this.,2
Storia ma da evitare...,Storico e molto discusso.. Tram 28 preso d'assalto da i turisti a ogni ora e in ogni modo!!Sicuramente attraversa part6e storica della città e arriva in posti dove dovresti andare a piedi... ma ormai è diventato impossibile!!Meglio magari vederlo passare e vedere la gente compressa all'interno.. meglio stare con i piedi a terra tranquilli e godere di questa bellissima città,2
Please dont waste your time not worth it .. queue is too long .. Lisbon should have tram wait time information,"Queue is very long over 90 minutes, one tram 28 just sat there doing nothing for ages then reversed away ! Then you have the rude people skipping the queue from the top thinking others won't notice. Driver kicked everyone out early at Graca. There is no information at the stop on the expected wait time. Lisbon is supposed to me a high tech city, seems like a simple thing to do..",1
Esperienza sopravvalutata,Sicuramente tutto il favoleggiare sul tram 28 e’ molto esagerato. Il tempo di attesa per prenderlo non è giustificato. Bello solo un piccolo tratto e vi consiglio di fare solo la parte che dalla cattedrale porta al castello.,2
"Assolutamente sconsigliato,molto decantato ma la realtà è diversa",Esperienza pessima:tram preso davanti al caffè “a brasileira”dopo aver speso 3 euro a testa ci fanno scendere solo dopo tre fermate per poi riprenderne un altro e spendere ulteriori 3euro a testa ma la cosa che più ci ha sconvolto è stata la scortesia è la maleducazione del conducente il quale ha trattato tutti i passeggeri come bestie da trasporto chiedendo in maniera prepotente di scendere …mai più neanche se mi pagassero,1
Not worth the wait,"After queuing for almost 3 hours in the baking sun, this was a disappointing experience. The tram was so packed that you can't really see much, it was difficult to take any photos without someone's arm in the way and the tram was quite fast so you can't really enjoy the sites.",2
Tram 28 ci lascia a piedi!,"Purtroppo abbiamo cercato più volte di prendere il tram 28 senza mai ottenere buoni risultati, abbiamo atteso fino a 40/5 minuti per poi vederci passare davanti il tram pieno di gente senza neanche fermasi.
Dopo vari giorni che cercavamo di salire ci siamo riusciti ma eravamo tutti attaccati che quasi non si respirava.
Esperienza bocciata!",2
Una perdita di tempo,Ho già detto tutto nel titolo. Un sacco di gente tipo sardine in scatola e da vedere non c’è poi così tanto. Se avete poco tempo a disposizione evitare questo giro,1
Esperienza terrificante,"Abbiamo fatto due ore di fila alla fermata “Martin Moniz” per poi ritrovarci stipati come sardine senza riuscire a vedere i luoghi di passaggio della linea.
Siamo scesi subito.
È meglio andare a piedi al Castello (la salita è meno ripida) e vedere il quartiere a piedi!",1
Bad service,"Bad service, insecurity, irresponsibility, failures in schedules, to avoid to the maximum.
Very old boats, lack of safety, total non-compliance with schedules underestimating passengers",1
Hand working,"Another day and I'm not following the schedule, namely the 7:45am service. It left 4 minutes later, which forced me to miss the next transport in Lisbon.",1
Career Supplies,"It is unacceptable that there are disruptions and interruptions in careers every day. The aging fleet, outdated, damaged doors, toilets, bar, TV's, wifi, everything out of service.",1
Unclean and underwhelming,"Sadly, this cooking class did not meet our expectations. We knew it would be different in someone's home vs. a commercial kitchen (something we were looking forward to). Unfortunately, it was unsanitary, including a litter box a few feet away that was used during our class. The cooking for the main dish was basic, mostly involving chopping, making a rue and tossing in frozen ingredients. We did not make a starter dish. The recipe for the Pasteis de Nata had been altered to be less sweet and non-traditional. We had hoped for more authentic portugese cooking. Despite the positive reviews online we left feeling disappointed.",2
Terrible tour operator. Did not show up or give appropriate information on how to find the operator on site,"I booked a tasting tour with this operator in December. I showed up a few hours early and was waiting around the area ahead in anticipation of this event. They only gave information in the reservation to look for an operator with an orange umbrella at a very busy square with no other information on name/gender/who to look for how/where exactly to look for an operator/what sign (other than that stupid orange umbrella to look for). When it was time of the tour, I looked and did not find any operator with an orange umbrella, and missed the tour. I let them know to refund me and disputed the credit card, but they refused to refund me. BEWARE! Take notice of this terrible operator. I did other tours in Berlin with other operators and many other places and this is a terrible one that I would absolutely not recommend.",1
Skip it,"It is an over priced tour that can not be justified. You can eat good local food with a better experience and far cheap in any of the small local restaurants in Lisboa.

For Bifana -& chouriço checkout Cervejaria O Trevo
For sardines and bachalau - Lisboa Tu & Eu

You can get local cheese and local wine at any place

Pastel - de - nata can be found every where and it is much fun to eat it in a cafe / bakery instead of eating it in a gift shop like we did.",1
Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Price,"We were really looking forward to the Lisbon Small-Group Food Tour with 18 Tastings in the Alfama District, but unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations. While the guide was very friendly and engaging, the food itself was quite underwhelming for the price they charge.

The sardine tasting was nothing more than a canned slice, the sausage offering was extremely ordinary, and the bifana sandwich was below average. For a tour that markets itself as a way to experience authentic local flavors, the food felt uninspired and lacked the quality we were hoping for.

Thankfully, we had a travel guide earlier in our trip who introduced us to truly authentic local cuisine—better quality and often at a fraction of the cost. In hindsight, those recommendations outshined anything on this tour by a long shot.

While the guide’s warmth and enthusiasm were appreciated, they couldn’t make up for the lackluster food experience. Unfortunately, we would not recommend this tour, especially given the many other excellent and more affordable food options available in Lisbon.",2
Worst RipOff Food Tour Ever,"Worst food tour ever. The guide took us to 5 different cheap restaurants with no AC, where we were offered ridiculous small and poor quality tastings to be accompanied with room temperature tap water and one or two (maximum) glasses of wine. The whole deceiving experience ended up in a gift shop trap where we were 'honored' with a tiny chocolate made cup of ginjinha, apparently home made but coming from a commercial bottle kept in a small fridge on a corner of the souvenir shop.
Knowing Lisbon pretty well, it' was painful to our pockets and extremely disappointing to our expectations. We have done a food tour recently for half price and the guide was well experienced. He introduced us to restaurants with either character or some history behind . A total pleasure that made us choose a more expensive tour this time expecting to get even more and better.
We highly recommend NOT TO CHOOSE this food tour.",1
Canceled our reservation twice without warning. Now our backups are sold out. Very frustrating.,"We booked this tour because it sounded amazing, only to have them cancel a week later saying it was overbooked! We booked again for a different date a week apart, only to have them cancel AGAIN a few days later! Now our backup options are already booked, and we are stuck finding alternative activities. Very disappointing! Book, but not with confidence. Or, choose a tour that will honor your reservation to begin with so you don't miss out.",1
Disappointing,"Sadly, it did not meet our expectations. They were aware that I am a pescatarian from the questionnaire we submitted when reserving the tour. When I asked for a substitution to the meat samples I was made to feel was a nuisance and was given a cold fish cake. It was uncomfortable and unnecessary to be treated this way and disappointing for the cost of $95. per person.
I would not recommend this tour.",2
Last minute cancellation with poor excuse,"They cancelled on us 10 minutes before the tour was due to start. I booked the tour through Viator over 30 days prior and received a confirmation email that the payment had processed and received the electronic tickets 24 hrs before, so I felt pretty good about this happening! We got to the pick up location and after waiting around for 15 minutes I started checking my phone to see if I had received any messages. They had sent a cancellation email 10 minutes before. In fairness, I later discovered an email from 3 hours before (buried among numerous work emails) with a poor excuse that their vehicle had broken down and needed to go into the shop (what sort of vehicle were they using anyway?). Why they couldn't have texted or called as they had my phone number...I don't know about you, but I am not checking my emails frequently while on vacation! I thought that it was pretty poor that they couldn't beg or borrow another vehicle if they really had a guide ready to go...I am giving them 2 stars only because the guy at the end of the phone seemed empathetic if nothing else.",2
Skip the tour…do the castle on your own,Our guide was a no show. I called the tour operator and they had no record of my booking even though I had a printout of the charge to my credit card. Terrible company,1
No way of contact,"It was raining too much in Lisbon, so I delayed for a few minutes and when I arrived, no one was there.
My disagreement is that on the only phone number they give they never answered, nor did they communicate with me by any means, in case there was any option that came by another means and reach them.
Communication after purchase is not good, it does not exist, compared to other tourism companies.",1
Pena - never when it rains!,"We were unfortunate to visit Pena Palace on a cold, rainy day. It was nobody's fault, however reception could have been better than the weather. After having bought our tickets using a vending machine at the entrance we have walked for some time uphill in the rain, as the courtesy bus shut it's door in front of our noses.Our entry time was scheduled in one hour. We had to queue inside of a tunnel leading to Pena Palace. We were asked by staff to move on outside and the queue was not moving for another 15 minutes while the rain was pouring on us. Why couldn't we wait in thetunnel and be asked towards the entrance in time to get in?
The staff were not trained neither instructed and frankly rude. This treatment has ruined our visit to a quite spectacular interior of the Palace.",2
SCAM!!!,"INADMISSIBLE!! Contrary to what is stated in the title, we did not visit Pena Palace. Already, the ticket is not included in the excursion (what interest for a guided tour??), so we paid extra 10€/pers to the guide on arrival and what was not our surprise when the guide told us in front of the Palace that we could not enter and that we had access only to the gardens!!! Moreover, we spent hours on the bus to finally have only 30min to the palace. Big SCAM; A FUIR!!",1
FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"INADMISSIBLE!! We had booked this guided tour which included that of the Palace of Pena, as stipulated in the title, at the price of 72€/person.
What was not our surprise when the guide asked us again 10€/person to access the site, when in the end we could not enter the said palace (only in the garden). BIG SCAM; TO FLEE!!",1
DO NOT USE HEAD OUT TOUR OPERATOR,"I booked my ticket VIA Head out: time slot was incorrect, false advertising since there is not such as Skipping the line and ticket were doubled the price at the venue.DO NOT USE THIS TOUR OPERATOR!The location are great and worth it",1
They don't warn of changes,"Reservation: Sintra, Palacio da Pena, Quinta da Regaleira and Cabo da Roca.
This activity was booked with Civitatis for 20 days, and was completely modified due to the risk of fire. However, this notice was already received by the Portuguese government a long time ago, so they should have warned us to cancel this activity, since the palaces we visited (Queluz Palace and Sintra National Palace) were not of interest to us nor was it what we had reserved in the beginning.
After arriving at the meeting point after a great early morning we were informed there that the Palaces of Pena and Quinta da Regaleira cannot be visited. Our reason for making this trip was EXCLUSIVELY to visit both Palaces. These companies were already aware of the fire risk and should have advised of this.
Moreover, the coach we were travelling in was not suitable for a day with more than 30 degrees: the air came out hot and was all glass, like a greenhouse. Tickets to these palaces are cheaper than the ones we had hired, and were very crowded due to the influx of people during the visit.",1
I wouldn't recommend it.,Poorly organized in terms of timing and language. We had a bilingual group so those of us who knew English had to listen to the explanations twice. In English it was better understood than in Spanish and we were not given too many explanations or historical details. Plus there was no time to watch Sintra quietly. A nice Guide but not well organized,2
Do not book with this company,"Do not book with this company!!
Today I have had a deeply disappointing experience with GetYourGuide that left me both frustrated and out of pocket. I booked tickets for several attractions in Sintra through their platform, but unfortunately, I sprained my ankle and was unable to make the ticket times.

When I reached out to GetYourGuide to explain my situation and request a refund, I was met with a shocking lack of empathy and flexibility. Despite providing evidence of my injury, their customer service was utterly unhelpful and refused to offer any form of compensation.

This company’s rigid policies and poor customer service have turned what was already a distressing situation into a complete nightmare. It's appalling that GetYourGuide prioritizes their profits over genuine customer care, especially in situations that are clearly beyond the customer's control.

I strongly advise against using GetYourGuide for any bookings. There are plenty of other companies that offer better customer service and show more understanding and flexibility towards their customers. Save yourself the hassle and avoid GetYourGuide at all costs.

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"Bait and switch. Terrible UNFRIENDLY tour guide.

1) This tour was terrible because the first stop was a beach town at 9 AM for ice cream where most businesses were closed. This was opposite of this published schedule. I asked myself, why are we even here?

2) The tour guide, Leonor was more interested in chatting with the bus driver rather than engaging with a tourists on the bus. She seemed almost irritated that someone could “bother” her with a question. I’ve been on TripAdvisor tours in other countries, which have been fantastic. This tour doesn’t measure up.

3) This tour consist of mostly pick ups and drop offs. With the exception of the palace tickets, this is something you could achieve with an Uber.

4) This tour is mostly UNGUIDED – NOT AS ADVERTISED: here’s what they wrote: “Our guide shall accompany you along the way, sharing stories and curiosities about the visited and seeing places.” THIS IS NOT THE CASE except for drop offs and pick ups.

With the exception of the palace tickets, this tour was a waste of money and a terrible experience.",1
Do NOT book this tour.,"I would NOT recommend this tour. It's ""BAIT AND SWITCH.""

1) They switched the schedule. First stop (Cascais) was supposed to be the LAST afternoon stop. As a result, we were dropped off at 9:00 AM for ice cream in a beach town where most business were closed. I asked myself, ""why are we even here?""

2) The tour guide, Leonor F. was more interested in chatting with the bus driver as we passed beautiful sites. She gave us minimal info as we entered town. She made almost LITTLE / NO EFFORT to engage with the tourists on the bus. Leonor seem irritated that a tourist would bother her with questions. I've been on other tours in other countries, and she was the absolute worse!

3) The entire ""tour"" consisted of Leonor doing mostly drop-off and pick-up. She was a terrible tour guide and did not ""accompany anyone along the (entire) way, sharing stories and curiosities about the visited (and seen) places.""

I would NOT book a tour with this company again. Low quality tour guide and bait and switch schedule. I might as well have taken an Uber. Except for the included palace tickets, this was a waste of money.",1
Unhappy,"The tour operator cancelled our trip close to the day (saying it was overbooked) and, when we tried to book for next day, found that the cost had doubled.",1
A TOTAL SCAM,"AN ABSOLUTE SCAM. 2 hours before the visit they tell us that there is no guide in Spanish, that the visit will be in English and Portuguese without giving us the option of refunding the money, changing the day/time...nothing. Even so, we are going so as not to lose the money we had paid. The guide who was there did not even have the flag color agreed upon in the messages. It started more than half an hour late, which later did not increase during the visit. The language didn't matter because the guide DIDN'T SPEAK FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES, he didn't explain ANYTHING, amazing, something truly unheard of, he took us from one place to another without explaining anything, a shame, a scam, a scam. The feeling of feeling cheated was tremendous. I hope that no one contracts with this company as there are so many others like we saw there that are cheaper and have real guides that explained the Quinta. He didn't give us a single piece of information, no dates, nothing at all... incredible. A disastrous experience that I hope no one else has to endure.",1
Very poor explanation,"The place is beautiful and worth visiting, but our guide did not make it an enriching experience. He didn't introduce us to anything about the place, he didn't explain who the Masons were or link one thing to another. Furthermore, what it says in the tour description is not what is actually told. Much lack of detail and explanation. In the end we learned more from what we later searched on the internet than what the boy told us. You don't see everything there is there, and you are left with many areas unexplored. IT DOES NOT COST THE PRICE THAT THE GUIDED TOUR PRICES FOR WHAT IT IS, VERY EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT THEY GIVE YOU AFTER.",1
Do Not Book,"This tour was so disorganized. The tour guide started off by saying our tour did not include tickets to Pena Palace, so we had to give the tour guide money for tickets if we wanted to go. When I said we didn't have enough cash on hand, he suggested we go to an ATM (pulling out money abroad incurs transaction fees...) When I said we'd prefer to buy tickets online instead, he made it seem like that was a difficult and undesirable thing to do (it wasn't). I wish we had been reminded in advance to buy entry tickets for a certain time so we wouldn't have been scrambling the morning of the tour (with no Wifi available) to buy tickets. Then, we were dropped off in downtown Sintra to ""get coffee."" By the time we finally went to Regaleira, there was already a huge line to go down the staircase. We should have lined up early at Regaleira instead. Furthermore, the guide told us he was not able to enter certain places with us and give a tour...so I'm not really sure why we had a guide to begin with. Apparently just to get us from point A to point B. At Pena Palace, he told us to ""take pictures of things and ask questions later...."" Finally, the tour guide and driver were talking about inappropriate and unprofessional things in Portuguese (my husband is a native Portuguese speaker). Overall I would not recommend this tour to others. It was overpriced for the services rendered.",2
Tour operator bails last minute,"Tour operator cancelled trip 16 hours before it was to happen middle of day before due to me being only one that booked.
They had my money since July and due to them cancelling trip cost me $45 more to rebook yet they get no punishment but th customer does.

Fair to see why customer should pay the price for vendor failure to get business.

Will never us them again",1
Over tourism spoiling it,"My wife and I went late October to hopefully miss the summer crowds. It was not the case. We were told by a few different friends this is a must see. So we went on our way from Lisbon to nazare. Biggest mistake ever. The crowds were insane, took us 3 hours to heard through, like sheep, 3 hours that should have taken 30 minutes. Over tourism plain and simple. A joke. No wonder Europeans are getting g fed up with it.
I do not recommend going",2
The worst place in Portugal,"Imagine shopping for deals on Black Fridays in the 90s, only completely disorganised and with zero regards for you. Bullied left and right, charged for transport that doesn’t come, lines 100s of metres long for a minibus that transport 20 people at a time, but if you don’t get there on time you are denied entrance. Place is full to the brim, they just want to rake as much cash as possible. Do yourself a favour and skip it. There’s way better in Portugal",1
Bad information,"The place is spectacular, the shame is the poor indication and little information there is and the unfriendly staff.

Firstly, if you buy the ticket at a machine, you have no information about whether or not you can enter. There are some booths with staff that you don't even see when you arrive, because the first thing there where the transportation drops you off are the ticket machines.
The problem with buying the ticket at a machine is that it does not give you any information.

They made us wait for an hour outside the enclosure, which you think may be the entrance to the palace, so you wait outside when the time arrives, but it is not like that. When we arrived at the palace it was past our hour and they did not let us pass. When going to the ticket information, we had to wait because there was no staff because they had an hour break for lunch (in such a touristy place that there is no staff rotation is outrageous). The queue demanding the same thing as us was considerable but unfortunately the vast majority, if not all, accepted to wait 2 hours for the next entry, having to pay a supplement of €6.50 after having paid your entry!",1
Amazing locations ruined by bad management of the groups,"Even though we selected an english guide, we were placed in a primarily spanish group - even though there were plenty of other english-speaking participants. The guide spoke very bad english. We also realized that the guide provided much more info in spanish than in english, and of course we had a lot of idle time during the spanish parts.",2
Feeling cheated with a disappointing trip,"The weather was horrible with a rain storm. My trip was supposed to be for the following day, but they changed it to the day before for whatever reason, with my consent. I would think that these bus companies would be very well informed of the weather. We traveled in a small mini van which made the trip uncomfortable for 8 people. First, we made a stop in Cascais from Lisbon to pick up a couple so half an hour went towards that. So it took us two hours to get to Fátima. The guide Daniel was very nice, but didn’t seem to be too knowledgeable. For the entire two hours to get there, he did not say a word, until we got there, and I asked him to please enlighten us with information.. He left us at the place for 3 1/2 hours and then met up with us at the end. So we were on our own basically. It really wasn’t a “guided” tour. There was a lot of stuff we didn’t get to see, but some of it had to do with the weather. If they wouldn’t have changed the date to the day before, it would have probably been a nicer trip of course. The guide dropped everyone off where they were picked up from. It was a rain storm, so I was expecting for the guide to at least drop us off in a taxi stand. We paid 170+ dollars to Tuga Tours and we feel cheated.",2
Sintra Experience,"Sintra faces mass tourism and the municipality does not know how to manage this influx of tourists. Complete disorganization to move between sites whether by car or public transport. The latter are very expensive, more than 4 euros/person, so more expensive than taking an Uber with the family. Plan very very widely to move from one site to another and cash because credit card cannot be used on buses…
The sites are beautiful but you are overwhelmed by the waves of tourists. For the price, the sites are not well maintained enough
.",2
Very unhappy with the guide,"Our guide was called Adrián F. The tour was very express, it gave very little historical context to understand the place. We feel as if he had read Wikipedia and told us. He only focused on explaining what can be seen with the naked eye and not even that because in one of the chapels, when explaining the exterior reliefs of one of the doors, he said: ""Here there are reliefs from the Bible but since I have not read it I don't even have idea"" which surprised us.

In general, the visit lasted very little, about an hour later, we were halfway done. We were also surprised that when he said goodbye he told us that he was leaving because we weren't going to want to listen to him talk for two hours, but it's just what we wanted and what we had paid for, we thought.

These are just some of the atrocities he said throughout the tour. In summary, we believe that it is a place that deserves a guided tour but for us specifically with this guide things have gone quite badly (with this we do not mean that the rest of the guides or the company are bad since we have only had this one experience, not We consider it sufficient to give an opinion on the matter).",1
Find another tour company.,"Read the bad reviews and believe them! The reason to book a trip like this is to get the timed ticket for an inside tour at Pena Palace. Our tour guide, who has other bad reviews on this site, still leads this trip. He got us to Pena Palace more than 1/2 hour late so that we were denied entry. We also spent an hour at Cascais at 9 in the morning where there was nothing to do. He does not guide people around there, or really anyplace else and provides little to no historical information about places you do go. Other reviews mention a guide who advises people to get a gelatto at Cascais at 9 in the morning, and who talks when the bus driver has the radio on and has to be told you can't hear him, repeatedly. That person or other like him are still leading tours. This is nothing but glorified transportation between locations, and even that they could not do on time.",1
Bad experience. Not recommendable.,There were hardly any explanations from the guide. It only provided basic data that can be found on any simple web page. I do not recommend this company for the guided tour. There were other guides who explained much more and better. It would have been better and cheaper to take the audio guide.,1
Shame,Just before departure we were told that we were not allowed into Sintra (heat) and that they had an alternative plan. While it had been so hot for days... So they chose not to tell us. Afterwards I asked for part of the money back but no response.,2
"Disappointed Experience with Tugatrips to Sintra, Cascias & Pena Palace","The Tugatrips meeting point was very disorganized. Hard to know what was going on within a mob of over 500 people, and there was no signage or guidance from the staff.

Once we boarded our bus, the narrative from the tour guide was lame.

Upon arrival, we entered the castle as a group, and as instructed by the tour guide, we had to meet at a certain time at the exit of the castle. The time came, and no tour guide was in sight; she did not give us her number to contact her. We wasted one hour looking for her and finally called the company to locate her. This was very disappointing and unprofessional on the tour guide's part, and she had apparently lost the 22-person group.

At lunch in Sintra, the restaurants the tour guide gave us were not good.

Our time in Sintra and Cascais was rushed.

I do not recommend Tugatrips. Overall, bad experience and, unprofessional tour guide and for what we paid it would have been best to take the bus into Sintra and pay a local tour guide.",1
Horrible,VERY displeased with this tour. Organizing everyone into groups was very unorganaized. Hugo was not a good tour guide. He talked too much and gave too much information at once. He was not able to assist with getting Peña Palace tickets. He then argued with me about it. He was also not considerate of others in our group with knee problems and made them climb stairs for no reason. He was not patient and blamed everything on the “chaos”. The wait was over an hour to see the well at Quinta de Regaleira. Hugo just left us in line. It took over an hour to get to Peña Palace. Then we had to wait on the 5 people whom did have tickets to the palace. Just was not a great experience at all. Very frustrating and a waste of my day. Would not recommend. 0/10.,1
Would not recommend Tugatrips,"Firstly, would like to say that none of this review is due to the tour guide Elder who should be proud of how he handled a tough day at work. He was a fantastic tour guide. However his company let him down
Was a very poorly organised by the company Tugatrips.
- Bus was over booked meaning there were not enough seats for everyone. This lead to people being removed from the tour and starting an hour late
- We were to catch a bus from the Moorish Castle to Pene Palace. However on the way to picking us up the bus broke down with no indication of how long a replacement would be.
- The ticket into Pene Palace was not included in the tour. However this was asked to be paid before leaving the bus at the end of the day in cash without warning. With most people carrying cash the Tugatrips boss asked poor Elder to make everyone go to the ATM to get cash out where this should have been compensated for the lateness of the tour. 8 hour tour turned into 12 hour tour",1
I paid a lot for sitting in a van and waiting in long lines!😢,Perhaps my expectations were too high. We let an hour late because there wasn't enough seats in the van for everyone. The tour guide couldn't get any support from his office and I felt bad for him. We waited in long lines at the first castle because we were late and only had 49 minutes at the last one because our van broke down on the way to drive us. I would not book with this company again.,2
Will not recommend,"Tour operator needs to maintain scheduled time. Due to a delay in arrival to Pena Palace, the entire group was not allowed entry.",1
My trip was overbooked and I was told to get off the bus!,"Dear TripAdvisor agent,
I booked a trip to Sintra today through your website. However, when I arrived to the pickup place in the morning, I was told by the tour guide the trip was overbooked and that there was no place for me on the bus.
Therefore, you can imagine my disappointment with this vendor.",1
No guided tour - just expensive bus trip,"The trip was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. We were unlucky that the sights in Sintra were closed due to the high risk of fire, so we did the alternative program. This wasn't really a problem for us - but it was for our guide.
First we looked at the Palace of Queluz. Beautiful grounds, but the organization on site didn't work at all. In other words, we waited for over half an hour in front of the entrance. We were supposed to download an app on our phones so that we could start the audio guide for the palace - but unfortunately this didn't work for anyone because of the high number of people. Our guide was unable to give us any information about the palace, so the trip was pretty pointless. She apologized to us several times and explained to us that she didn't know anything about the palace - because the palace in Sintra was her main concern. This annoyed me quite a bit, because a guide had to be prepared for the alternative tour too.

Lunch break in Sintra town was fine, organization and information from the guide was very scarce. Getting there takes forever and we sat in the bus for over an hour (traffic jam)

Then we went on to a lookout point. It was OK, nothing spectacular.

We ended up in Caiscais where we were dropped off again and picked up by the bus an hour later.

Overall, a bus tour without much information from the guide, which could have been done much more cheaply by train. A shame to spend money unnecessarily!",2
Terrible,"Scammers! Stay away

I booked this tour through Expedia, showed up at the meeting spot and no one was there. I called the tour company, no answer. I called Expedia and they confirmed the tour company canceled the tour and didn’t notify me. Then they REFUSED to refund me my money even after Expedia got involved . Stay as far away from them as possible.",1
TUGATRIPS is a SCAM,"Do not use this company. It's a scam. I bought 4 tickets for a guided tour for Quinta Regadeaira. I got instructions on where to meet with the guide. I waited for 40 min with other people who also bought tickets from them. They claim I didn't show, but I have proof I was there on time. It's a shame because I'm sure these kinds of experiences will make people hesitant to visit a beautiful country like Portugal. DO NOT BUY FROM TUGATRIPS",1
Total scam.,"In the first place there has been no tasting of
Sweets. I booked a 3 hour tour for three
people: 72 euros that included a visit to Sintra.
Nobody told me that it was mandatory to get an entry
to Quinta da Regaleira (11 euros per person).
They picked us up next to the station giving a
walk through Sintra with few explanations.
We waited more than 30 minutes for them to arrive.
20 people who had hired for 25
Euros 1.5 hour guided tour with entrance
included. In the end my visit lasted 2 hours with
30 minutes of waiting, or almost the same as the
group that had paid 25. I paid 35
There were 3 of us, that is 105 for 1.5 hours. a stay,
No tasting. What would the guide have done?
If I had not wanted to get the ticket?
Where is the guided tour of Sintra?
Very disappointed.",2
"Not recommended, just go for a freetour","Our guide only explained a few places while Quinta da Regaleira has a wide variety of places to visit, he didn't explain to us really important points: the palace, the church, the lake and many other, we had to visit all that places on our own. The quality of the explanations was very poor and short and, when asked about other places, the guide would told us that those places were not important, when that is simply not true. Also, we signed up for a tour in Spanish and it turned out that we were mixed with the tourist that had signed up for a tour in English so the guide would explain first in one language and the repeat the same thing in the other language so the short explanation turned out to be even shorter (half of the time, actually). Really bad experience, all the Spanish tourist were talking about this and we all felt dissapointed. I recommend signing up for a freetour rather than this.",1
Poorly organised tour to Sintra,"Poorly organised tour, bus was hot with warm air on, had no windows and driver tried selling us over priced water.
Tour operator failed to purchase tickets for the entire group to go inside Sintra castle and requested we pay cash. Left us waiting outside the castle for over an hour with no explanation",1
The guide was late with poor English,"Our guide turned up half an hour late, none of the group received correspondence to let us know and the trout group were not responding. After waiting we bought more entry tickets as the crowds were getting out of control. As we were so late the wait line to see the well had got so long the guide said we would have to wait for about 40 minutes in the queue and then there would be half an hour left of the tour. His English was poor and difficult to understand. I think he was filling in for a staff member that didn’t show so felt sorry for him. Really disappointing.",2
Poor.,"We waited with a group of around 25 people at the arranged spot for nearly an hour. No guide turned up and half the group had to wait in line to buy new tickets.
Guide eventually turned up and we did the tour but it was a bit lifeless as half the group were late for other things and fed up.

I emailed and raised a complaint which I got a reply saying they would look into it and respond in 2 days. They then closed the complaint and asked me to provide feedback. (this happens when they close the response from their end. I work in customer service)

Did not gave a response at all from them. Wasted 3 hours.",1
Worst tour ever!,"It was the guide’s 3rd day on the job. His English was quite poor (English tour), he did not organize the group well, and his ability to provide information was terrible. A paraphrased example: “This is the Sintra town square. Sintra was founded by the Romans. It changed names several times over the centuries.” That was the sum total of the information we received standing in front of the Sintra National Palace.

Due to the lack of organization and direction, we spent a LOT of time standing around waiting - for the guide, for tour members arguing with the guide, for lost tour members…

I place most of the blame for this debacle on the tour company, Tugatours. The guide should clearly have been partnered with a more seasoned guide. Additionally, many in the tour were confused and thought that tickets into Pena Palace and grounds was included. It was not… but the guide offered that if you wanted those tickets he would have the office reserve them and we could give the guide cash. Good grief! Simply build the ticket into the tour and avoid all the confusion and extra work (that detracted from our available time).",1
Unethically charged me,"I never received any confirmation of this reservation nor did it show up in my Trip Advisor or Viator profiles. Therefore, I thought the reservation didn’t confirm so I made other plans. I was surprised to receive a confirmation text from the company 23 hours before the trip was to begin but was unable cancel because of the 24 hour cancellation policy. The company unethically charged me anyway despite my multiple attempts to rectify the problem with both the tour company and Viator. When they say 24 hour cancellation policy, don’t believe them. They might just take your money.",1
Waste of money,"The way you advertise Pena palace is included , very misleading. When you train your staff they need to have been trained better . Our guide knew nothing, didn’t know how to keep the group together lost 5 people for an half an hour . Waste time, waiting for him to figure out what to do next. Asking for my money back. Terrible",2
Poor experience,"Our tour guide had no idea what he was doing, we asked questions about the place and he did not know the answers or gave wrong information. You have to pay extra for Pena Palace or you will outside the palace for about 90min doing nothing.",1
Not worth it and badly organized!,"The guide was on her first day and she was very nervous, confused and even provided wrong information! Her English was not even good. I understand her pain on the first day of job and we all tried to help her, but it's not fair that the customers have to suffer from this, especially considering how expensive is this tour!
To be honest, regardless of the quality of the guide, 80€ is just a theft! Cascais is just not worth the visit, Cabo da Roca was nice but it was just 15 minutes of walk on a small cliff with some pictures. Information provided about Pena Palace is easily readable on the panels in the room. The only comfort was the private shuttle to easily move between locations, and the option to jump the queue in Pena Palace. With good planning, you can save a lot of money.
Lastly, I didn't like that:
- The order of visit was inverted compared to what described on the website (Cascais, Cabo and Sintra last). The tour was supposed to finish at 16:20, but we came back to Lisbon almost one hour later. This is not good for people that might have made other plans for the rest of their afternoon. If this is because we couldn't find entrance at Pena palace before 14:30, then I'm sorry but the organisation of the tour just sucks. And they could have at least informed us in advance about the change of itinerary and end time.
- The radios used for the guided tour had a tolerance of just a few meters, afterwards the signal is lost. When the guide was in one room, people in 1-2 rooms behind couldn't hear anything! Considering the small spaces of Pena Palace, it might be worth to restrict the number of attendants to 10-15 max (we were 20). And the guide was not using the microphone at right times, so there was a lot of background noises, while important information was being missed.
- The flag wasn't used in an appropriate way to guide the group, some people also got lost.
- Information provided in the bus was fragmented and confused, we were just being bothered in the middle of our power nap for no reason. Comprehensive information should be provided at the beginning or end of the trip, not one piece of information every 10 minutes!",2
Worst Tour Experience Ever!,"We booked an all day tour for June 6 from Lisbon to Sintra and Cascais. My husband and I arrived at the departure point we had been told when we booked the tickets. There were ten other people at this same place waiting for the tour guide and bus. They never came. Apparently the departure point had been changed. The emails I got about it were full of internet gibberish and were very unclear for such an important detail. There was no local contact number for us to call. We finally got through to a customer service agent who was not very helpful. All 12 of us were early for the tour and we had all prepaid. We lost $172, which Tugatrips has refused to refund. If you multiply that by 12, they made over $1000 off of our group that got stranded. If it had just been my husband and me, I would have said it was our mistake. We explained to them that there were 12 people waiting at Palacio da Foz Tourism Office. We were all disappointed to miss this tour, and we were frustrated that they issued no apology and have refused to refund our money. I almost never write negative reviews, but people need to know how unprofessionally this was handled. We took two other tours in Portugal with other companies and they gave us a local contact number and accurate information. Please think twice before you book with Tugatrips!",1
"Terrible, did not get picked up for tour","DO NOT USE THIS TOUR GROUP. They change pickup location without notification. There were 10 people, of different groups, waiting for the tour bus that never showed up to pick us and now the refuse to give a refund for their mistake. 0 stars if possible. DO NOT USE THIS TOUR GROUP.",1
tour OK guide BAD,"The place was ok, it was super crowed and it is just a rich dude from the 1800 house. They should advertised that more.
But the part I really dislike is the fact that ours guide was telling a bunch of non sense about the illuminati, the freemason and so forth. Yeah their is a symbol of freemason . But they never bath in the blood of goat and stuff like that. when the stuff he was telling was completely false it was mostly fabricate for giving the tourist a sense a wonder or something like that...
i try to ask him question in English (ours tour was in English) and he didn't seen to understand English very well.
So sorry the guide was just not that good.",2
Very dissappointed,"We were very dissappointed with our experience. First our itinerary was not done in the advertised manner. We started in Cascais when this was advertised as the last stop. Our guide suggested swimming, gift shopping or getting a Gellato at 9.30 in the morning on a Sunday. As you can imagine not much was open. My partner and I had brought swim gear thinking we would have a quick dip at the end of the day. Our othe dissapointment was in the quality of the guide. He was friendly but he told us it was his first tour and it showed. He was so nervous his voice did not carry to the back of the bus and his English was only at an intermediate level and had a limited knowledge of the info. When I pay for a tourguide I expect a knowledgable one otherwise I could just get an audioguide and organise my own travel. Maybe a different guide would have improved the experience but I cannot recommend.",1
Avoid Tugatrips at all costs,"AVOID TUGATRIPS! we had booked in a tour to Sintra and Peña Palace on 2 June 2023. I booked through Trip.com and received a confirmation email with the booking details. Myself and my partner attended the pick up location at 8:10am as instructed for an 8:20am departure. Tugatrips never showed up. There were 10 of us waiting, one woman called the provider and they said that the pick up location had changed and they sent an email with a new location. None of the 10 people had received the email. We were left stranded and Tugatrips refused to come pick us up. I called Tugatrips and they advised that I could request a refund through Trip.com. I contacted Trip.com and they followed up with Tugatrips who then advised that I had cancelled the booking, which was a lie. They are scammers, and I lost out on $220 Australian. They would have made quite a profit off the poor people who missed out that day. I would give them a 0 out of 5 if I could.",1
Go to Pena Palace in the morning/ forget Regaleira,"The trip was full day Sintra: Regaleira and Pena Palace
Daniel, the Tugatrip guide I had clearly wasn't interested in really giving us any meaningful commentary. Too many, ""You know""- especially at Regaleira. Made vague references to the Masons but never clarified what he meant. Had trouble keeping track of how many people were in the group.
Pena Palace was disappointing. The head phones were useless. Daniel rushed through rooms. Couldn't give us details as ""A commentary isn't allowed in the Palace"" yet other groups were getting information. Anything I learned was from hearing other tour guides speaking. We were told, ""If you have a question about something, take a picture and you can show me after and I'll answer your query."" Pena Palace is a dead loss after 2:00 as the position of the sun meant you were always shooting towards it for palace pictures.
You'd be better off making your own travel arrangement and forget this ""guided"" tour.
At €68 + the €20 Pena Palace entry, it was a poor use of my resources and holiday time.
I went back to Sintra 4 days later and had a much better experience...but not with Tugatrips.
Photos show a dark Palace of indistinct colour due to angle of the sun at that time of day.",2
Some issues,"Very inconvenient that the ticket to Pena Palace is not included. The agency helped with the tickets, but they only accepted cash and no card payments. Also, long queues were a nightmare",1
It felt like a scam,"We took the Quinta da Regaleira skip the queue tour guide. When we got there, the guide bought then our tickets online (it only costs 11€) when we had to pay 23,5€ per person when we did the reservation. The guide did not seem to know about the topic and we had to queue regardless for the famous spots. He basically walked us through the garden but did not add anything to the experience. We felt it was a scam. Go there by yourself and get the online ticket.",1
Esqueçam a Regaleira por agora,"Reservamos com muita antecedência o tour, um dia antes dizem-nos que não havia em português. O guia era espectacular, muito simpático, mas não tem a culpa de não estar formado para ir a todos os cantos da Quinta, ainda por cima, dentro do Palácio nem guia tivemos. Muitas das coisas estão interditas, e o preço não é mais barato por isso. O local é fantástico mas parece um pouco desleixado. O espírito é fazer dinheiro com o muito turismo que acolhemos. Ficámos desapontados num dia que deveria ser místico",2
Tugatrips: Poor Tour of Quinta da Regaleira,"We went on Tugatrips's Quinta da Regaleira: Skip-the-Line & Guided Tour. It was the worst walking tour we have ever experienced: (1) the tour group was too large, about 26 people speaking 3 different languages; (2) it started 20 minutes after the designated start time, and we still had to wait in line to get in; (3) the guide failed to give an introduction to the site, talked forward while walking so no one except people next to him could hear him, and his English was mediocre at best - to this day, the history and meaning of this palace and grounds remains a mystery; (4) the guide did not tell us what to expect, so when we climbed up the hill (a long way) to the end of the line to enter the initiation chamber, only then did we realize that we would be standing in line about 40 minutes; (5) when we got to the end of the line the guide left to take someone to the bathroom, at which point 8 people, including the 2 of us, ditched the tour. We explored on our own. On our way out we ran into the tour and there were only about 6 people left - meaning that about 20 people ditched the tour before its completion. Some of the problems were due to to the company (e.g., too many people on the tour) and some due to the tour guide (e.g., too inexperienced).",1
Not worth the visit.,"Booking online was ok. We arrived and found the guide but waited over 25 minutes for the tour to start, because he had to get tickets and there was a group complaining about the tickets/tour. We spent most of the time in the garden, which was interesting but we really wanted to see the house. The tour should have started at 1600 so we had to rush round the house. Inside was a real disappointment as there was only one floor to view and most of the exhibits were not there - just pictures of them.

I felt the tour - at that price - was a waste of money. We could - and should - have just bought tickets and gone on our own - the guide was nice but as he was not allowed into the house, you could hardly call it a guided tour.

Advice - there are much better places to go in Lisbon.",2
Not worth it,"I thought my 70 euro ticket to Sintra was overpriced. It doesn’t include a ticket to the palace. Basically, you pay 70 euro for a glorified group taxi via van with a tour guide that makes several stops.",2
Disappointing,"Lots of standing around waiting and in ticket/entry lines. We had hoped a tour would allow us to skip lines. Only saw 2 sites in a full-day. Guide was friendly but non-informative, providing limited insights in an off-hand manner. And the info he did give was often difficult to understand. Pena Palace does not need a guide, as the path thru is well marked with good info on signs in each room. Quinta Regaleira was all outside, walking thru the grounds -- again, didn't need a guide for that. He gave us a few minutes at the end to go thru the house without him (supposedly he's not allowed.) Again, the interior had lots of info on signs. We recommend taking public transportation to Sintra, then hire a taxi or tuk-tuk to get from site to site. If we had done that we would have saved money, plus had time to see the Moorish Castle and National Palace. Best part of day was a nice lunch we found on our own.",1
Improperly managed expectations.,"Our group arrived early to the pick up point as instructed but it took over 30 minutes for us to leave. We were told our bus was in traffic only to discover it had been there the entire time but the guide did not notice it. We were told in advance that the workers at Peña Palace were on strike so we’d be going to Quinta De Regaleira instead and we’d be able to see the famous well and should get right in. When we arrived, we were placed in a long line and left there by our tour guide who told us to wait there while he confirmed which line we should wait in (ticketed or non-ticketed). During this time, several large tour groups passed us in line (despite being told earlier by our guide that there was no priority today). As we made our way closer to the line, our tour guide asked us to block others from skipping the line, which resulted in hostility from other guests who felt entitled to skip. We ended up waiting 53 minutes to enter the castle. Once we entered, the guide gave us a tour which was mostly well paced. At the end of the tour, he told us we had one hour left which we could use to go get lunch (not enough time to do that in busy Sintra) or wait in line for 1 hour to see the well that we were told we’d all be able to see. We settled for looking at a smaller well and walking through the caves. We left to get some snacks as he told us we’d have some time to also eat in Caiscas which we assumed would have more time for dining. After leaving the castles, he took us to the westernmost point of Europe for about 30 minutes and then went to Caiscas for a total of 45 minutes. We got lunch but didn’t have time to see the beach and were rushed back to the bus. Overall, the tour is not well paced, it all felt very rushed and there definitely was no line skipping involved. I understand that the tour guide was doing the best he could but the lack of communication and inconsistencies were frustrating to navigate. We all felt we would’ve been better off just renting a car and going to those places on our own.",1
Sintra,"La salida ha sido 30 min después de lo previsto. Tras un trayecto de media hora se para en el pueblo de Sintra para hacer una pausa de 25 min. Tras dirigirse hacia el Castillo de Pena con un trayecto de 10 min, se vuelve a hacer una pausa de 15 min. En el Palacio de Pena el guía no pudo hacer la visita por un problema con los auriculares por lo que la entrada ha sido de 1 hora de forma libre. En ese momento te dan hora y media para comer. Finalmente se ve el Palacio de la Regaleira. En definitiva es una excursión que se podría hacer en 3 o 4 horas si no se perdieran tantos tiempos muertos. El conductor del bus era bastante temerario en su conducción. La reserva era en Español pero el 90% de la excursión ha sido en inglés. Hasta el punto de decir que mejor seguía todo en inglés. Por el precio y dado que no hubo visita guiada compensa ir en Taxi desde Lisboa y pagar la entrada libre a los Palacios.",2
Get a tour through another guide company,"We were only given a tour of la regalaría and were not taken to Peña palace, which was the big attraction of the tour. They used the excuse that they were not able to get tickets on time, which is not a good excuse if you do these tours all the time. Very disappointed and was not given a refund. They took us to another sight instead, casacais, which the town is underwhelming and I would advise skipping. Just buy a ticket online and take the train to Peña palace yourself instead of touring with them.",2
non vale la pena,"la guida parlava inglese, credo che non fosse specificato e visto che il tour era pubblicizzato su una guida italiana e descritto in italiano ho dato x scontato che fosse in italiano.io parlo inglese ma il mio compagno purtoppo no ma in ogni caso non mi è piaciuto per niente.",2
Worst experience! Do not book!,"Worst experience ever. They insisted we pay after just the 2nd stop of the tour, we were promised 90min tour to 4 different locations. After we paid (50min in) he started saying tour is finished. We stopped somewhere for 5min, we come back and he had left! He just left us stranded , we only visited 2 places, and finished the tour after just 50min!
We called and called and no one answered!
They dishonest and crooks! Driver name is Mia.

Do not book!",1
Average tour,Overall below average tour. Our guide Bruno didn’t share as much information about the city as we would have liked and on multiple occasions had no clue regarding simple questions about Lisbon. We did get to see a cool viewpoint of the city!,2
The idea is great but the performance not so much,"The tour was recomended by our hotel. The idea is great but the performance not so much.
We took a 3 hour tour.
The traffic was terrible, everything was crazy loud so there was no chance to even hear the guide talking during the drive, even though she tried.
The pavement of the streets is really uneven and therefore the ride was really bumpy and uncomfortable, especially if you have some back problems.
Even though it is probably the fastest way to see the town, especially the old city center with its narrow and steep streets, but you still just drive past the sights, so there is also very little/no chance to take any pictures.
Price/performance not so good.",2

Scammers,"A total scam. Said they bring us up AND down the mountain to Pena Palace for 50 paid up front. Once we wanted to go down they wanted to charge us 25 more. Saying we understood it wrong, when they cant even properly understand basic English. Dont go with these guys",1
Inconvenient,Nice but I do not recommend it because it is expensive but especially uncomfortable given the road cloak made of stones.... better taxi also costs much less,2
Too expensive,"This was the only Tuk Tuk company as you came off the ship. The lady at the counter was not very approachable and although agreed a small discount, the overall price for a 3 hour tour for 4 adults and one child was over €400.

We booked at 10.15am and the driver did not arrive until over an hour later!! The driver was very good and accommodating and took us to as many places as he could possibly fit in. He was pleasant and helpful. The price for this tour was definitely not worth it.",2
Buyers beware of price switch,"We were asking for a couple of quotes for the Tuk Tuk ride tour and Rogerio from this place gave us an incredible deal we couldn’t turn down. We set up a day and time and I reconfirmed the price on text the day of the tour. He came to pick us up, had the kids take pictures on the Tuk Tuk and we were on our way. He was extremely nice the entire time, checking on us and giving us history of the city. Came the end of the tour when he dropped us off, he said he has bad news and that his boss said he can’t offer the ride at the price he quoted us and charged us £70 more. We would’ve given him a good tip if we were not being ambushed like that. I just feel it should’ve been disclosed beforehand when he picked us up and there were many times he could’ve told us. It was really unexpected and shocking to have to pay the additional even though I had the confirmation on text. Rogerio worked for the company for many years, no way we were the first family he did this to. What he did just make the entire trip sour so anyone book with him just beware of this. Make sure you ask him before the ride and even during the ride. I hope no more family will fall into this trap.",2
"A quite a good experience, but too expensive","I liked the idea of sitting in a TukTuk and with a teenager, who wasn’t keen on walking, this seemed to be a really good way to get around town. The driver and everything was OK. But found it ridiculously expensive. I shouldn‘t have pre-booked the tour probably. As I didn’t know Lisbon and we only had a day, I thought it might be better to pre-book, but there are hundreds of them, so there was no need really. The driver did point out things and talked to us, but it was really difficult to understand, as you have the noise of the engine, all the traffic around (city noise) and the wind in your ears… It was nice to be able to access parts of town like this, as you wouldn’t be able to by car and definitely worth an experience, the tuktuk drivers yelling at each other and you‘re inmidst it all… you cannot see buildings really well, as you have the sun roof. So all in all— I wouldn‘t say to my friends, that they absolutely should do this.",2
Dangerous Vechicles!,Would never recommend. They drive to fast. We went around a corner so fast the vehicle flipped on it's side. We slide across the street and hit a tree. I cut my head open and my husband broke his shoulder (which the hospital didn't detect after having a ct scan of his head and chest.) Once he was home and had xrays they detected the fracture . I think driver's in Spain think stop lights and speed limits are suggestions.,1
Uncomfortable and poor guided tour.,"We booked this through our hotel. The ride was incredibly uncomfortable. The vehicle has no shock absorbers on an extremely bump terrain. Our backs were in pain and it was extremely difficult to get on and off. The visibility was subpar- the roof covering blocks views so you have literally very little photo opps. Our guide did not have an enough knowledge and English communication skills to provide a proper ""guided tour"". This cost us $160 euros and quite frankly, we should have just booked a private tour with a proper vehicle to get more value. We have taken MANY guided tours on travel, and this was the worst one.",2
Unfortunate Tuk Tuk Experience,"We traveled throughout Spain and Portugal and had many experiences with numerous guides and even a Tuk Tuk tour in Porto. Unfortunately, this was not a good experience. We learned virtually nothing about the city of Lisbon on this 3 hour tour. Our driver/guide was a nice man but he was from Bangladesh and did not speak clearly enough for us to understand him. Most Tuk Tuk guides will talk and tell you information throughout the tour so that you walk away feeling like you know the city. Our guide only spoke if we asked him about something or when we arrived at a certain location and when he did speak, we barely understood what he was saying. After a 3 hour tour and $225 + tip, we should have walked away with a very good amount of knowledge. Instead, we knew only the very minimum. It was a very disappointing experience and for those reasons we would never advise booking with this company. One last minor thing, he was 30 minutes late for the tour as we waited on the street.",1
Pas de chance ?,"J’ai réservé cette activité bien à l’avance après consultation des avis élogieux de Tripadvisor alors je me dis que nous avons joué de malchance… 48h avant le rdv, j’envoie un mail pour confirmation du point de rdv. Pas de réponse. Idem 36h avant. 24h avant nous passons à pied au lieu théorique du rdv et ne voyons rien. J’essaye d’appeler au numéro indiqué dans la réservation. Ça sonne dans le vide. Je contacte l’assistance Viator. Je passe 1h en ligne avec eux. Ils me confirment que l’excursion aura lieu. Dans la soirée je reçois sms m’indiquant que le guide prévu s’est blessé et qu’il faudrait décaler l’heure de notre rdv ;impossible puisque nous avons prévu autre chose . Encore beaucoup de messages échangés pour finalement décider d’annuler l’activité puisque aucun arrangement n’a pu être trouvé. Il a fallu que nous trouvions une autre société de Tuktuk au dernier moment. En bref plusieurs heures perdues pour ne pas faire le tour avec eux.",1
,"Predatory business practices. They make you sign up for 6 months minimum or charge a 70 euro cancellation fee. This was never made clear to me verbally, only written down on the paper they make you sign. We were looking for a month to month membership and didn't realize we had committed for 6 months. There's also an initial fee of 35 euros to register. We only stayed for one month and had to pay an exorbitant amount in initial fees and cancellation. I would NOT recommend this place at all.

Definitely not ideal for travelers in Lisbon for a short period of time.",1
"Disappointing, the outside view is better","Among the 11 towers of the fortress of San Giorgio, the tower of Ulysses is easily recognizable because a sort of cylindrical metal structure emerges from its terrace. In fact, it would not differ from the other towers that can be found along the walkways of the walls if it were not for the fact that a dark room has been created inside: the interior of the tower is completely dark and the light from a telescope which, via special rods operated by the guide, is oriented in various directions so that the projected image changes continuously, offering an enlarged 360° panorama of the city. However, the image is not defined, I would even say almost blurry and this experience, which lasted a few minutes, told me nothing. I think it is preferable to enjoy the natural panorama that can be seen from the stands and which, by following the entire walkway of the walls, still covers an angle of 360°. The visits, in small groups, begin at 10 am and continue every 15 minutes alternating in different languages (Italian is not available). In my opinion, this attraction can easily be skipped when visiting the castle of San Giorgio.",2
Disappointed,The visit to the dark room of the Tower of Ulysses was quite disappointing. Even the visit to the castle I don't think is worth the ticket price.,2
Very disappointing,"Had booked a trip for today. They were no shows and didn’t answer the phone
… website also appears to be gone? Very disappointing as it was. Birthday celebrant not cheap",1
"Good food, fun, one very rude staff member.","18/05/2025

3rd time going to this place always have a lot of fun but this time there was this member of staff who was very rude and unpleasant i didn't get her name but while teaching the axes and serving she was rude and seemed like she was at the wrong job.

Love the axes
Love the food",2
Bad experience,"It was the worst restaurant I've ever been to.
Table of 25 people, the arrival difference of the first and last hamburger was 30 min. The employees are not very concerned about the service and the tickets arrived after the last hamburger arrived.
The hamburgers know well, but they don't have meat (they looked like two slices of lime. I risk saying that the two together do not add 90g of meat)
Group menu entries were insufficient to divide.

This service was accepted if it costs 15/20 euros, but not for 30/40€ which is what they ask.

I do not recommend.",1
You walk a little further and you will find other establishments where YES,We were conned. They said there was happy hour where the cubalibres and mojitos were at 5 € and when paying we did not apply the discount CHEATING ADVERTISING!!,1
Misleading advertising,"On the blackboard outside it said that there was happy hour at 5€ mojito and cuba libre and it was misleading advertising, only included a drink called cuba libre and only the normal mojito, gin and tonic and strawberry mojito charged it at the original price, still the normal mojitos on the ticket we have had to tell them to apply the discount, the super small glasses. We've felt cheated, and the super expensive axe games, I'm not coming back.",1
Nope and nope.,"My husband and I went to USAXE as it was my husbands birthday and he really fancied a burger! The service was lovely (very polite and friendly) but, the food, not so much. No one else was there so it wasn’t a “busy” thing. Hubby had a bacon burger and an oreo milkshake. Milkshake was great although a lot of Nutella. His burger was ok. My burger wasn’t cooked. I had the plant burger. I called for it extra crispy as I just love a crispy patty but it was the opposite and has hardly touched the grill. It was inedible. No one came to check if we were ok after food has been dropped off so I couldn’t address it. Yes, I could have been more aggressive and found someone, kicked up a drink etc but I feel I shouldn’t have to.",2
Bad service experience!,"Bad service experience! My request came incomplete and I was completely disrespected by the lack of solutions. This implied my appetite, anyway... I won't eat again, I won't recommend it to anyone. Don't be fooled by the attractive place! If you want a quiet meal, ASAxe is not an option!",1
NOT a shooting range,"THIS IS NOT A SHOOTING CLUB. How can it POSSIBLY be listed as ""the best central Portugal shooting Range?""",1
No to be recommended,"The app gives you 2 download site. One is Soundcloud (that I do not use) and the other is to Google Maps that simply gives direction from your current location to a Point of Interest. No details are provided of the attractions you visit.
Quite frankly I cannot recommend.",1
Very disappointing experience – poorly organised and unprofessional,"I am very disappointed in the service of this organization. First I received a message that the tour was being adjusted because the group was too small. Then, two days before the planned activity, I was told that the tour was completely cancelled due to problems with the bus. It is strange that an organization like this apparently has only one bus available, without any backup option.

They themselves suggested to do the tour on Tuesday. To make that possible, I had to cancel and reschedule appointments, for which I also had to incur costs. When I then asked for compensation, I received a rude and unsympathetic reply. They said there was nothing they could do about it and simply suggested that we choose another day – which was not a viable option for me, with only four days in Lisbon and a tight schedule.

On top of that, I was eventually told that the tour on Tuesday could not be arranged after all. All in all, I found the service particularly bad, and I therefore advise against booking through this organization.

What I can recommend is the bus company Buendía Tours. I had a fantastic day with them – everything was well arranged and the staff were extremely friendly.",1
Ghosted,Don't book this! The local guy Francisco never showed up nor andwered on call/text... So dissapointing!,1
Guy never showed up,"Absolutely do not recommend. No specifics on when the pickup would happen, trying to get ahold of the guy fri 2 days, never replied to us or showed up to pick us up for the tour.",1
Very disappointing,"Very disappointing. You pay 10 euros entrance during the day. Upstairs is a bar, but the drinks are quite at the price. The view over the bridge is beautiful, but otherwise it is not very spectacular. I didn't think it was worth it at all.",2
Careful. Always request paper invoice at HORA. Para tudo. And ask with NIF.,"I went with my daughter to visit and paid with a Revolut card at the entrance (machine) but the receipt did not come out and the payment was pending.
Inside the building, I spoke to a poorly mooded lady and told her what was going on, which she didn’t help or even moved to the machine to check.
Said that if he wanted to go in he would have to use the portable terminal to the counter. This time I used another card since the Revolut apparently did not work.
I paid again and no receipt again.
I went up and consumed and paid with the Revolut card and it worked.
I complained by email sending all the justifications issued by the 2 banks.
They don't answer or return the money.
This has a name.",1
Weak... only worth the sight,"The view is beautiful... but I wasn't a fan of the bar... uncomfortable, cold, uncomfortable service, weak and unprofessional...",2
Don't go wearing sandals,I went at 5pm and lady explained I could pay €10 for Entry or wait until 6pm and do the €15 minimum spend. So I decide to go back at 6pm only to be told I couldn't get in at 6pm as I was wearing sandals!!! The same sandals I had on one hour before when I first arrived.,1
Overpriced greenhouse to die from heat trying to make a photo through a dirty window,"Only negative feelings. They are selling a greenhouse tickets at 10 eur. It is damn hot inside, no aircons, not even fans. We wanted to sit and have a drink with a view but once we done the circle, we were so wet that we happily rushed down. Not to mention dirty windows that spoil your photos as there are no way to get outside (no balcony or outside deck).",1
Sexist dress code beware,"I waited until the last night of my vacation to see Lisbon at night from the tower. I got there just after sunset. In fact we stretched out dinner to arrive at the perfect time.. I was refused entry due to my attire. I was dressed in cotton capri pants which were deemed by the two young women at the entrance as work out gear. The pants were not clingy nor were they like yoga pants. They would have allowed my son in who was dressed in cargo shorts and a tee shirt to enter. I watched as several men similarly dressed allowed entry. No requirement for men to have a collared shirt. In fact, they all looked like they were dressed for a run. I have had a wonderful time in Portugal and it’s too bad my last night was ruined by a sexist evaluation of my attire.",1
I felt robbed.,"I thought we were tricked.
It does not specify anywhere that there is a time limit for entry with consummation included.
We entered paying the entrance fee of 10 euros per person, and we thought that this amount would be reversed in consummation, and that was not what happened. Finally, when it was time to pay the bill, the amounts were increased. Because of the schedule. We entered at 5:30 pm and the drinks were a great value, when we left at 7:00 pm the prices were 50% more expensive. I thought it was absurd. I felt robbed.",1
"Bad service,","The service leaves something to be desired, the place is beautiful, cozy
However, I felt extremely deceived because I went in at 5pm, paid 10 euros, ordered some beers for 5 euros and when paying they charged 7.50 as the price increases after 6pm.",1
"We were not warned and we paid a non-consumable 10 euro ticket at 5:20 pm and at 6 pm it was consumable, worse the value changes",We felt cheated from the start. There was no clear information that from 5 pm to 5:30 pm we could go up but without consuming the entrance fee.,1
Cold bar from the people to the place,"It's too cold, even with blankets and heaters available.
They added drinks to a card wrongly and didn't want to admit the mistake by being rude.
You pay a ridiculous elevator fee.
Exaggerated minimum consumption of €15
It is not possible to smoke in the premises or go downstairs with glasses and return later.
It's basically a hallway with a bar.
Imperial at €7.5.
It perfectly represents the SANA group.",1
Absolutely overpriced...,"So the view is great but it can get hot if you're facing the sun, it does not seem to be air conditioned. But the worst is the prices: in the afternoon you pay 10 euros/adult (5 for kids) for the privilege to go up to the bar. But then they charge you in addition 17 euros for a Mojito and 4 euros for a coke.
WTF are we? in New York or Hong Kong? Only went to show the view to my kid.",2
Complete disrespect for guests,"This is a complete scam and a divorce of people. When we bought tickets on their website, money was debited from me, but the ticket did not come to the post office. I called them on the phone and they said that I should write them a letter about it and come with payment confirmation and that they would certainly let us in. OK When we arrived, we were told that no one knew anything and in general we should buy a ticket for 15 euros, not 10 euros. There is no such option on the site at all! OK. Return the money ! They say no - you can come later within a month, but now they won't let us in - they have a ""dress code"". What's the dress code? There is nothing on the site about it! But they say, and point to the wall with a finger where some piece of paper hangs. With us, they didn’t let another tourist in - something didn’t suit them in his clothes either. The result - money was spent that no one returned, time wasted and the mood was spoiled. By the way, there is no book of complaints. The law does not dictate to them. Don't waste your time and money!",1
"Discriminado, humilhado a entrada","Eu e a minha esposa fomos visitar a torre Vasco Da Gama. (19h)
Quando cheguei informaram me que era 15 euros por pessoa e pediram me para esperar 5 minutos para o elevador poder descer.
Enquanto espero um grupo de pessoas vão se juntado (6 a 8 pessoas)
5 minutos depois vem o segurança e diz que não posso entrar por causa do dress code.
Todos entraram menos eu e a minha esposa.
Como africano ficam mts dúvidas
Fico triste, frustado de não ter o poder mudar a mentalidade das pessoas.
Fui discriminação e humilhado.
Mas infelizmente aconteceu.",1
Have to pay to access bar,"We had planned to go up here for the view and a drink after taking the cable car. Note though that the €15 entry redeemable against drinks referred to in another review is only after 6pm. Would have happily done this and enjoyed a few drinks. But prior to 6pm it is €10 each just to access the bar and viewing platform, which feels overpriced in comparison.",1
The boat ride was canceled,The boat ride was canceled . Apparently they tried to get a hold of me but I didn't know until I showed up. They do have a disclaimer on their excursions that they can cancel if they do not have enough people.,1
Unreliable Company,"5 minutes before we were due to get on the boat we were informed that the boat was having issues and they had to cancel the trip. It was very disappointing with no alternative offered, just avail of a refund. It was our last evening in Lisbon so we didn’t get the opportunity to do it another day. My advice would be book with a more reliable company!",1
Not friendly,"The day before, they notified me that there was a problem with the boat, unfortunately my schedule were set for the future and not able to be re-scheduled.

The lady at the counter was not really friendly, maybe because I don’t speak Portuguese, so my partner took it over. Even he desks it’s she seemed very annoyed for the entire conversation.

We went to the booth next, she was very helpful and we enjoyed their cruise instead.",1
No free drink,"“With a drink” Bartender did not know about the free drink even after showing, had to pay. Don’t think I saw anyone else get one either",1
Navio Precário e velho!,"O passeio é bem básico, não chega a ser perigoso mas esteja preparado para uma partida com bastante balanço. O navio é bem velhinho, com banheiros precários, assentos decentes na parte interna, mas no deck superior a estrutura é bem caída.

O passeio em si faz uma rota eficiente, com boa velocidade e segurança.

Com mais 20 euros um casal pode ter uma experiência muito mais confortável num saveiro ou outra embarcação mais sofisticada.",2
Disappointing Experience - Not Worth It,"We took this cruise on our first night and were really disappointed. No commentary onboard — the app didn’t work and there was no WiFi. Outdoor seats were all taken when we arrived. Indoor windows were filthy, so the views were poor, and the boat itself felt unclean. Wine was okay, but snacks (especially the olives) were low quality. Overall, not a great experience and wouldn’t recommend.",1
An unromantic and over capacity shambles…,"Disappointing!!!!

Definitely didn’t live up to how this was advertised.

A ‘romantic sunset cruise perfect for couples’ was actually an ‘overbooked, unromantic and very disorganised shambles’

The queue was huge when we arrived at gate B and we were anxious the boat couldn’t accommodate that many people. Sure enough we were right.

There were not enough tables for guests so a number of us, including ourselves had to either find a corner to stand in, or sit indoors on inward facing chairs (with no tables) in what felt like a dentists waiting room. This provided a challenge when the snacks came out (a tray of bread and butter, peanuts, olives, chocolate cake) as we had to stand holding our drinks and a tray and take it in turns to eat or drink something.

Lots of guests were complaining and apart from one guest with a baby who were given a table, everyone else had to make do with any spare bit of space we could find.

Also worth noting that the boat had one very small upper deck (open air), a decent sized middle deck (also open air) and the third deck which is where we were confined to is an inside deck which is made very dark due to the tint on the windows.

Given we booked this for our 1st Wedding Anniversary evening, we left very disappointed and would not recommend. Definitely not worth the money.",2
To flee,"Boat, Sao Jorge, dilapidated and filthy, good for scrap metal, undrinkable coffee. 18€ per person, a real scam. Only interest: the city seen from the river. To be avoided absolutely, a tourist catcher.",1
"Poor communication, cancelled at last minute.","Booked and paid in advance of travel, arrived 30 minutes pre departure but no boat in sight. Was told would be late as refueling. Waited until 15 minutes after scheduled departure and then advised trip was cancelled. Poor communication and little staff around to assist.",1
Very disappointing experience,This was an absolute was of time. No narrative was done to point out any point of interest. Snack of dry bread and jam and Olive’s was poor at best. Boat looks tired and crew un interested in their passengers. Don’t waste your time or money.,2
Don't bother with Blue Cruises. Total rip-off.,We did the afternoon Tagides Brunch cruise. Only found out on board that the only drinks provided were orange juice and water. Food was garbage and service non existent. Don't waste your money on this rip off of a boat cruise. 70 € not worth €10.,1
Not worth the money.,"One star just for the one staff member who was polite.
We were looking forward to this boat trip all day after the hottest day of the year (39 degrees). Showed up early as we wanted a good seat and waited in the lovely station as it would be stupid to stand in the sun with no cover for 15 mins.
Then we went to queue up, the boat trip before us got off on time but we were all left waiting without any information as to what was going on for nearly 40 mins.
Once we got on we were greeted with a sigh and a nod. Sat down, only a few of the windows opened so we had to choose whether to be cooked under the sun for 2 hours or cooked in the indoor heat with no air con?
We received lovely refreshing orange juice with ice or wine. We waited for snacks, as advertised, but apparently that was only available for sunset cruise passengers.
As we set off late on the trip we just assumed we would arrive back 40 mins later than planned. However we arrived back exactly in time for the next boat trip… sooooo how do we get our money and time back… you don’t I suppose.
The other boats in the dock looked a lot more appealing, clean and friendly so if you are looking for a relaxing boat trip… maybe try somewhere else.",1
Cannot be recommended,"The boat is very old. The benches lack rungs, upholstery is torn open, chairs partly completely weathered. No shadow spots on the upper deck. The wine is only available from the tour at 3pm. Wasn't so communicated online. I can't recommend the tour. Value for money is not right at all. 1.5 hours is very long when it's so dirty and scruffy.",1
Waste of time,Broken rusty chairs. Smelly toilets. No guide. No idea what were looking at. The free drink is tap water or orange. A waste of time.,1
Don’t bother…. Waste of two hours.,Paid 18€ to sit on a rusty old chair for a couple of hours on a tired tatty boat. Commentary was non existent so had no idea what we were looking at. Found a QR code on way off hidden on a table that supposedly linked to an online commentary. No one else on the trip had found it so we were all in the dark. Sat on starboard side so we’re basically the whole river distance away from shore so the sights of Lisbon were just a blur in the distance. Not recommended and a waste of two hours in Lisbon.,1
Not recommandable!,"The first part was okay. You see a lot places of interest from a nice perspective.

The wines were awful, I would recommend to take a beer or water because the ones from those mini bottles are terrible. Portugal has so much good wine and with 50+ people on board you should pour at least an okay wine out of a 75cl bottle. The worst part was the arrival at the gate again. It took over an hour (!!!) for the so called captain to bring the ship close enough to the jetty in order to let the passengers leave the ship. No information was given by the staff. I had to approach them myself and got told, that they have a new captain who is inexperienced with the ship. How can you do that?! I've been on ships in several countries and I never ever experienced anything like this! Horrible! Over one hour to late we were finally able to leave the ship. Not recommandable!",1
Left something to be desired,"Boat poorly maintained and with poor hygiene in the women's bathroom.
What was served was bad (peanuts not even 100g, olives, two fillets (really fillet) of three types of bread and a 200ml drink (water OR wine OR juice), ONE unit per person. I felt cheated.",2
Disappointed.,"Cruise departed very late. No “hello” welcome on board, no safety information about lifejackets etc. No Audio/commentary as advertised, included drink was orange juice from a carton, which you had to go and find, staff looked pretty miserable, no guide leaflet received with tickets, so an uninformative two hours. No goodbye or thanks for using blue cruises. Weather and scenery amazing.",2
Nop,Terrible experience. The wine was bad and the ship moved too much. They should rethink this whole tour. It may have worked a while back but not anymore,2
"Not as advertised, what a disappointment","Don't be fooled by their pictures... We were shown photos and told which boat we were going to get, the picture had couches and looked quite nice... Expectation vs reality was a joke...",1
Still on the Dock as the Sun went down!,"Was a little concerned that the meet time was pretty close to sunset. Even more so as we were stood on the dock as the sun was going down. We got onboard just as the sun disappeared over the horizon. Not really a sunset cruise! The cruise itself was ok, despite being dark for the majority of it!",2
"Long, tiring and unattractive ride","Old boat, but well preserved internally. Long and tiring ride… by the end, almost everyone is asleep or bored.
Not worth it!",1
Strongly advise against this company,"10/10 would recommend a sunset cruise, but 1/10 with this company.
No commentary or guidance on anything you were seeing, the wine was awful, had to go and find the food if you were paying attention, the staff were not friendly, and the boat was not safe",1
"Left at sunset, still on the Dock 7.30pm",Absolutely waste of money left at 7:30. You could see sunset from the dock. pitch dark couldn’t see anything apart from lights wasting time going round to make up time this Cruise leave too late?,1
Beautiful views but disappointing boat and facilities,"We went for this sunset cruise and we were told by the booking staff there would be a guide, music and lights displayed. There was nothing of that sort. The snacks offered looked like they have been opened for a while. Alongside this, the sofa’s looked quite dirty, the windows were very dirty and some of them did not open at all. Furthermore, my mum had slipped down the stairs and they had no plasters in their first aid box which was quite concerning. For the price we paid, it was certainly not worth the experience. I would definitely avoid this!",2
Avoid !,"Booked the tour with brunch. Brunch was obviously left over from breakfast and was dreadful. One staff member said we could have water yet the barman with the dreadlocks refused us. He spent most of the time looking bored and talking in his mobile phone.
No commentary and no instructions how to get it.
Very poor.",2

"Lovely cruise, terrible food","Four stars for a beautiful cruise around Lisbon. But minus three for a totally inedible brunch option. Not appealing to begin with but bread was stale, scrambled eggs burned etc. Top tip ... take the cruise but bring a sandwich",1
Horrible,"We did a brunch cruise, got on the boat, and the boat was out of almost all of the drinks including bar drinks. Food was awful and employees did not care to help anyone who had questions. It was supposed to have an audio guide as well, but it was not working. So we sat for two hours, not knowing what we were looking at. If I could, I would get this tour zero out of five stars unless you were just looking for a lazy boat ride to see the shoreline.",1
Choose an alternative cruise.,Disappointing and uncomfortable experience. No commentary given despite passing many landmarks. 90% of windows closed inside despite scorching heat. Why?? No shade on top deck. Left 20 minutes late and had to wait in blazing sun to board. Would not recommend.,2
Déçu du staff,"Croisière sympa avec boisson offerte et snack Malheuresement le crew n’est pas à la hauteur lors de demande importante, il n’en a rien à cirer surtout le barman qui préfère tout bonnement continuer de nettoyer et vite rentrer chez lui plutôt que de s’occuper des clients.",2
Pathetic service,"Pathetic food and wine, kind but confused personnel, nice views.
The pictures shows an elegantly refurbished casilheiro boat with some sort of rich buffet. In reality, clients are handed a tray with 20 olives, half a slice of bread, a pastel de nata and a glass of very bad wine during the 2 hour cruise between 7 and 9 pm. In case you want more, the cafeteria provides the same things but at extortion level prices.
The views are nice and you will be enjoying the cruise overall, but you may want to bring your own food and forget the implied disrespect for customers that their pathetic offer implies.",2
Don’t waste your time of money. It’s a joke!!!,"The worst boat cruise tour I have ever been on. Been on many and used to even work for a harbor cruise company. They has the boat loaded with guests. Only had two servers to serve the “snacks and beverage”(snacks were some peanuts, gross olives, two slices of sandwich bread w/butter packets and a pastel de Nate. Drink was the smallest bottle of beer in the world lol). Many people didn’t get their snack plate at all while many got it toward the end of the cruise. The person working the bar was not a bartender and seemed to have been awoken from his sleep in a geriatric ward. It was impossible to get a second beverage. If you go to the bar he will just stare at you and you’ll wait until one of the two servers for 300+ people tell you to have a seat and when they get to you then you can order a beer… which when they do, they will tell you in a minute because they are busy haha… most people chose to take a nap during this awful cruise lol don’t waste your time or money.",1
Pésima atención y trato al cliente,"En lugar de un paseo en barco parece que contratamos una Gymkana, ya que estuvimos más de media hora intentando localizar el mostrador donde recoger los tickets: nos mandaron a una ubicación errónea a 1km de distancia, nadie nos descolgaba el teléfono pese a llamar más de 5 veces y cuando finalmente encontramos el mostrador (tapado con unos carteles publicitarios), se lavaron las manos diciendo que era nuestra culpa haber perdido el barco, el cuál salió 5 minutos antes de la hora contratada. La chica de recepción se excusó diciendo que su compañera era nueva pero no nos devolvieron el dinero y la única solución que nos dieron fue cambiar la reserva al día siguiente, que ya no estábamos por Lisboa.
Pésima atención y trato al cliente. Nada recomendado!",1
Valentine's cruise is Lisbon,"We went to the Valentine's Day dinner cruise in Lisbon. I got the tickets at Get your guide, as a valentine's gift to my boyfriend. It said the cruise would have relaxing music and romantic setting. I emailed the company to reserve a window table (as I didn't have the tables map, I couldn't see the tables, so I only chose a random number from the ones offered to me). Arriving at the boat, we were greeted with a small glass of champagne. And that was the whole romantic setting during the whole cruise. We were taken to the upper deck and shown our table. The table was set against a wall between a window and a door. We couldn't see anything, unless we leant back. Also, to our surprise, there was another couple sat at our table, which completely broke the atmosphere. Also, nothing in the boat reminded us of a romantic atmosphere, no decoration or flowers or even candles around. There was only a very small red candle at the centre of the table. The music was also far from relaxing, we felt like being at a disco. When it got to a more romantic selection, mostly based in the 80s, the songs wouldn't be played in their entirety, they would only play the beginning and cut to another song. We were served the food and had a choice of 2 wine types - red or white. The wine was nor paired with the type of food being served. Also, the waiters had to come to your table to top up on the wine, however, for some reason, they went to the same tables but skipped ours, which was really frustrating. For a good part of the meal, we ended up drinking only water. We tried to get the atten5of the waiters, but they always seemed very bad tempered and paid little attention to us. After getting up and chasing a waiter, they finally came to top our wine up.
The food was average and the soup was nor very warm. The dishes from previous courses were not collected and they only fully cleaned our table near the end.
The bathrooms were also very awful. In the women's bathrooms, there were only 2 stalls. One was very wet on the floor, with puddles everywhere and it smelled bad. The second one was not flushing.
Overall, it was a very underwhelming experience, and I don't recommend.",2
Friendly but small,"Friendly staff, but the entrance fee is with 10€ a bit too much regarding the two small walls to climb. The entrance is a bit hard to find. Important to know ist that they only allow the use of liquid chalk, which you can purchase from them. The route difficulty is questionable",2
Vestigios bar - Lisbon,Very weak. Bad view of the river. The music is very messy. You don't understand any rhythm. Coffee and cocktail from middle down.,1
This place is a mistake,"Terrible place, very unpleasent staff (especially owner ) really You should avoid this place. There is a lot of very nice places arround.",1
I regret I booked with this company.,"The driver never showed up or communicated with me. We waited, searched called, texted. No customer service. We had to take Uber and had to request a refund .",1
Avoid this agency at all costs!,"I booked an activity with this agency on GET YOUR GUIDE carefully planned my trip, and even took days off to enjoy the experience. Less than two hours before the scheduled time, they cancelled everything — no real apology, no responsibility, just a cold “we are overbooked” message, as if ruining someone’s plans was completely normal.

The person handling the communication showed zero professionalism, zero empathy, and absolutely no sense of customer service. It felt like dealing with amateurs playing at running a business, not serious professionals….This agency is chaotic, unreliable, and disrespectful. Trusting them with your time and money is a huge risk — you could end up with ruined plans and no solutions, exactly like what happened to me.

There are many serious agencies that know how to respect their clients.
This is not one of them. Stay away if you value your time, your money, and your peace of mind.",1
Disappointed cancellation,My tour never happened as it was cancelled at 8pm the previous evening when I was advised the guide had called in sick. Very disappointing. Luckily I was able to find another tour company with one spare ticket!,1
Nie wieder!,"Besteck der Luxusklasse gekauft. Im Geschäft alles top. In die Schweiz geliefert wurde 2. Klassware. Nicht poliert, mit Kratzer. Nach Reklamation am Hauptsitz keine Antwort. Dann eine Abholungseinladung für das Besteck von DHL. Rücksendung des teuren Bestecks an Vista Alegre. Seither nichts mehr gehört. Das sind jetzt 8 Wochen... Bis heute keine Antwort auf die verschiedenen Mails, noch wurde der bezahlte Betrag zurückerstattet.

Péssimo atendimento!,"Sempre passo na Vista Alegre quando estou em Lisboa e compro uma louca. Desta vez peguei um bowl, pelo balanço da prateleira o suporte de prato balançou e o prato caiu na prateleira, fez barulho mas não quebrou nada! A vendedora veio perguntou se tinha acontecido algo, eu disse q estava tudo certo mas q o suporte era frágil e ela grosseiramente nos disse que deveríamos ser mais cuidadosos e nem foi ver ou colocar o prato no lugar.

Vodafone not an option for roaming in Europe,"Bought a 30 day/20 GB card at Porto airport, good service. Card supposed to cover Europe incl. Turkey and now 13 days into the 30 days, no connection. Can't ring English speaking Vodafone Portugal as the line for English when ringing from outside Portugal can't be used when card is not working...hello?? Local Vodafone rep in Istanbul unable to assist as different company...??? So in short, don't use Vodafone",1
Sleight of hand,"Be very wary when getting your SIM card, that it actually carries the advertised 10GB/30 days. The SIM card I was given only had 2GB.

Bad experience with the tour,"I'm not happy with the walking tour I choose since it's difficult to find out where the tour group is, even I already stand by there.",2
"Some cool pics, a lot of shaking",It was shaking us the whole time to like simulate flying or something? Good way to see some views but nothing super special. Was so nauseous after for the rest of the day. Would not do again,2
terrible experience,"I started with high expectations, but unfortunately I was disappointed. It was not a flying experience, but a shaking. I was nauseous and couldn't wait for it to end. It could have been so much better. The image was blurry, people with glasses get VR glasses fogged up. Sound quality was not good. Would not recommend.",1
Bad experience in Serra da Estrela,"Bad experience. I do not recommend. We paid a lot for a 10 hour tour in Serra da Estrela, leaving Porto, and the itinerary sold is not compatible with the time, as it is 5 hours on the road including round trip and it is not possible to do everything promised (Covilhã, Torre, Sabugueiro and Seia) and have lunch at 5h. Even more so with the unfavorable weather of rain and fog that we experienced. We were misguided and ended up disadvantaged, only making the first two stops. Very frustrating!",1
Just a car service with poor guidance!,I can not say the tour was terrible but there was very little guidance. We found ourselves being dropped off at locations and on our own to figure things out. It was basically a driving service to these locations and just for that it was overpriced. I would not recommend this company.,2
"Racist, Rude.","Racist and rude at the same time. Stay away from his tours, very racist and rude he openly talks about how the people he makes money of are ruining the city and makes you feel uncomfortable.",1
El guía NO acudió al tour reservado,"Vergonzoso. Reservamos el tour con antelación confiando en RagnarokTour. Al llegar al punto de encuentro a la hora indicada, nos encontramos que ningún guía acude. Tras llamar y poner varios mensajes nadie responde tampoco, por lo que los planes que teníamos se cancelaron sin que tuviéramos forma de encontrar alternativas ni recibir explicaciones.

Sin Duda una experiencia pésima que dejan una sensación bastante amarga",1
Bad experience,"Bad experience. I do not recommend.
No customer care, no common sense, they just follow rules without any critical sense.",1
Dirty and gloomy,"This place is deplorable and very dirty
There was hair everywhere on the floor received by a not very friendly person. I asked if they provided towels and they told me they never made the bed.
I find that this is misleading advertising, received a lottery gift card with 1 night included, breakfast and dinner.
You had the impression of being in a dismal place. I will report this to the regional prefect because I, myself, a tourism staff, would not dare offer this to my guests.",1
Not as advertised,"There must have been an error. Our airport transport to our hotel did not come. We called the service on our confirmation but they said they did not get that order number and did not come. We had to beg other services to get us a car to take us to our hotel.

We tried to get a refund from Expedia. After several emails they refused to give us our refund citing that they gave our money to the transportation company and could not get a refund from the company. Too bad. Thankfully our credit carrier guarantees our payment and refunded us the money",1
Imperia urban transport,"Public transport is third world!!!
They don't run at the scheduled time, no one can give you explanations at the terminus in Piazza Dante. Tourists are left waiting up to an hour to travel through the city.
A shame!!!",1
Spammers at the airport,"CAUTION: if you need to get from the airport to anywhere in Lisbon, beware of scammers. Someone will ask you if you want a taxi. They take you to a private car with no metre. At your destination, they will tell you it costs more than €200 which should cost about €20. Lots of yelling involved. Not a good way to start your trip. Take a licensed taxi or public transport.",1
Better change for walking tour,"I was very disappointed with the tour of Lisbon. We visited in a van, almost didn’t stop anywhere and I had trouble understanding the English of the guide.",2
Not helpful.,"We’ve booked a trip trough e-mail. The mails were helpful and friendly. We also payed in advance trough the website-link in the email. At the start of the tour nobody came. After 20 min, I get a response that I didn’t booked a tour. Although they confirmed by email and the money was transferred. ( I could see this on my account). We’ve contacted the company but there was no initiative to sort this out because the system didn’t send a confirmation so they couldn’t do anything, We had a stressful afternoon calling their booking firm and our bank to sort this out. We really regret that WHTT was not helpful to sort this out. Would have been nice if they tried more, they really made us feel like scammers.",2
Just your average free walking tour - but for 40€!,"Unstructured, false facts, and no sight of the promised socio-political discussions. Especially towards the end it just turned into an enlistment of places: ""This is the university. This is the hospital. This is a nice sunset view."", all without additional info. Most questions that would lead to a deeper discussion were turned down with a quick superficial answer by our guide Teresa.
Still two stars, because I think the idea of stopping for some traditional drinks and snacks is a good idea.
Otherwise I definitely felt like we wasted 80€!!! and 3hrs on a loop that we could've walked by ourselves.

We might've just been unlucky with the guide, but the tour was far from what ""We Hate Toursim"" promises to be special at.",2
Disappointing Day with David,"David was NOT a good tour guide. Firstly, he did not the follow itinerary as outlined on the website. In addition, we did not attend all of the sites that are listed. He did not know how to drive the van, which made me carsick. Most disappointingly, we spent only 30 minutes at Palace of Pena and were discouraged to tour inside.
We were seated in the third row of the van and struggled to hear any of David’s instructions and/or commentary. This led to us being confused the ENTIRE day. On top that, at each stop we were left to wander without guidance. His restaurant recommendation, Tasca do Xico, was underwhelming to say the least.
Maybe it was an off day for David, but this was a waste of €69 and 8 hours of my day.",1
Small car and air conditioning off!,"Unpleasant experience with the guide Carla/Karla, the route is beautiful, but I suggest other tourists to look for another company that does the tour. I felt going for military enlistment not for a tourist tour. Small car to accommodate with comfort the 8 people (5 were fat and unfortunately need to suit the current needs of the population), to turn on the air conditioning we had to ask (because the guide was only with her window open, the passengers who were in the last benches were mainly the ones who suffered the most from the heat.",2
Fatima tour,We booked this as a small tour group. We were lumped together as a group of 4 mini busses on the day of. After a delay of 1 hour and another delay for a flat tire we arrived at our first stop. This was the gift shop outside Fatima which for some unkown reason we stayed there for over an hour despite all the delays. We arrived in Fatima around noon and then were ushered to lunch at a restaraunt we did not pick and had a meal of fish with the rest of the group which by this time we realised they all knew each other. The rest of the tour was kind of rushed because of all the dalys and a lengthy luncheon. While we did enjoy the stops we made we felt that we did not get what we had booked for.,2
Disappointment,"Started the trip where it would end according to the brochure.
Brochure shows pictures of places wich aint part of the tour.
No information in the brochure or on website about duration for the places to visit.
At 10.00 we had to pay the entrance fee cash for the Pena castle...then tickets could be booked for a visit at 15.00.
Lot of traffic delay on the way to Sintra and spend 1,5 hour for lunch and a little walk.
Extra money for bustransfer with a waiting queue and no information about this in advance.
1 hour only left to visit the castle... no
time for the park.
The Pena castle a UNESCO site would be the highlight of the
day...but became a disappointment due to a badly organized program.",1
Terrible experience,"My family and I took the tour ""full day group tour to Sintra, Cascais, Estotil, Cabo da Roca and Estoril"" by Whereto.pt. our experience is so bad that my husband and I can't calm down for two days now. I have never experienced such a bad organization for a visit to a national UNESCO site. unfortunately Pena Palace in Sintra was just a ""hello and bye"" visit for us. an hour or even less time to visit such a site is ridiculous. wasting an unnecessarily long time in souvenir towns and restaurants. coordinating the tour with the wishes of the group participating in it was unfortunately out of the question in our case.",1
Terrible experience,"Our experience is terrible. Not enough words to describe this bad trip.
Poor driving style of the driver. All the time chatting about everything but else the sights.
Reverse order of the tour.
No entrance tickets pre-booked to the most visited place in Portugal Sintra Palace. Therefore too little time to visit the park and castle. We almost had to run through the palace to see the castle from the outside and take a few pictures.
Asking for cash to make a reservation without explaining the price structure. Not return change. Paid a lot of money for minimal experience.
I will definitely not recommend this provider",1
Rude Carla,"Carla was the most unprofessional and rudest driver and tour guide I’ve had in my 35 years of traveling around the world. She spoke to all of her Guest rudely and dismissively, and continued to take calls from her family when she should have been telling us about the trip. It was inexcusable. I would not recommend her to anyone.",1
Poor service. The driver blamed us for leaving the group when he told us to get out and catch the Metro. An absolute lie,"The vehicle was not appropriate. It was uncomfortable - not enough leg room or body room. We were both squashed in the front seat. The air con did not work in the back. We paid the driver cash to purchase tickets to Pena Castle. We gave him €35 and he told us he didn't have change on him, but would give it to us later. He never did. The driver's skills were poor and he was doing 120kph+ on the highway in 100kph limit. At the end of the tour the driver told us he could not return us to our hotel because the roads were closed for the parade. He told us to get out and catch the Metro and go 2 stops. We had difficulty buying tickets as we only speak English. Locals helped us buy them at our cost and it was 3 stops then a 15 minute walk to our hotel. Very poor customer service. Would not recommend to anyone.",2
Too bad...,"I liked the place and the music. Our Guide Antonio was very friendly. But I did not understand in the experience what could justify the Award of 45 € (...?)
I think the concept needs to be revisited because many of us feel we've been ripped off with this activity. We were served 3 olives and a piece of bread as tapas then a dish that barely satisfied us, no dessert... I stay on my end",2
Too expensive,Faro evening is far too expensive and can easily be done WITHOUT a guide - for half the price! It's a shame because the guide made a lot of effort.,1
Not Professional tour leader.,"I would like to send a email of complaint from the recent Fado tour experience, on January 4th, 2023.

I found the guide not very professional and as a tour guide needs to be reviewed.

The food I found of the restaurant to be very average, as well there was an incident with another gentleman on the tour who was taking both videos and photos of both the group and the restaurant. He didn’t even ask permission to take videos and pics of the group, I found this very offensive, and I asked the guide to speak to the gentleman, but refused and said it was my responsibility.

I found that as a tour guide is responsible for the group, and take action when required.

I would like a follow up with both him, is name was Marco, and your company.

I think some sort of compensation from your company for my bad experience.",1
Go to O’Gilins Irish pub instead,Worst pub crawl I’ve ever been on. The workers did nothing to get the crowd interacting together. Don’t book,1
Keep on walking,"Food:
The food was average at best—nothing to write home about. The plates came out at different times, which made the meal feel disjointed.

Atmosphere and setting:
Located next to a bus and tram stop, the area is quite noisy, which detracts from the experience.

Staff:
Service was slow, with a 15-minute wait before we were even served. The staff were unfriendly and unwelcoming. P

Value for money:
Overpriced and feels like a classic tourist trap.

Comments:
While it’s worth a quick visit to see and taste some wine, I’d recommend skipping the food. There are much better options in the area.",2
Cheese board without bread,Cheese board of 19 euros. Without bread. Ask for some bread. Are the sandwiches for 8 euros on the bill. You can't eat olive oil and cheese spread without bread.,1
A WALK IN THE WOODS,"Where to start ???
Between waiting for a smile from the waitress and the arrival of the dishes, don't be afraid of getting older,
First of all, my partner thinks it’s an excellent, or I say brilliant, idea to order a sangria,
The most disgusting one of his life, he told me!
(and God only knows how much he drank)
Let's move on, he almost choked on a bark or rather a tree trunk that was in the glass (supporting photo)
We order our dish, a salad for me and a plate of Iberian ham for the gentleman
The shock was terrible, when the plates were placed on the table we were left speechless!
4 VULGAR SLICES OF RAW HAM, which were chasing each other on the plate (more than 13 euros) and regarding my salad, a huge joke as it was so livid, my husband raised his head for a long time thinking that it was tree leaves around, Surprise there was no tree in sight!
We won't talk about all these beggars coming to spoil this splendid feast, can't the monk from the monastery opposite accommodate them?
I therefore give the rating one star because zero being impossible to my sad regret,
ESCAPE AT ALL COSTS, EVEN RUN AND LOSE YOUR BACKPACK.",1
Much better to find,"Restaurant without much interest. For us it is a tourist trap with a view of the Monastery.
Be careful about billing for the blanket even when you are on the terrace in full sun without using it!!!",2
"Filthy, rude tourist rip-off","Awful and surly service. Absolutely filthy table, and swamped by flies. A homeless lady pestered customers constantly and the staff did nothing. Worst of all, they brought what we assumed were complimentary olives - which we didn’t order and didn’t eat - which they then charged for. When I complained, they refused to refund us and said we should have sent them back",1
Bad service,"Should have had a simple lunch. It took a very long time to get it and some of what we ordered never arrived. The guests at the next table asked for salt, which never came either. There were three young girls who worked there, they probably thought it was more exciting to talk to each other than to serve. I don't think they thought about (or cared about) that we could see from the outdoor terrace, that they just stood there chatting the whole time. Several customers left when they were not served, or did not receive their food. Probably should have done that too. Also had to run after them to get paid. The food was decent when it finally arrived, but eat somewhere else.",1
No personal service!,"When tasting wines, I expect personal service with advice on what I might like. This place has two vending machines (I kid you not). And they “weren’t doing flights,” the Saturday we stopped in.",2
Mostly Out of Order,"3 of the 4 tasting stations were out of order. The 1 working station had 5 choices, ranging from 2.5 to 4 euros for a tiny pour. Displayed wine seems disorganized. Don't bother.",1
Call first!,In reality it is not a review because for 2 consecutive days we showed up at 5.30pm and found it closed with a sign warning us that the place was occupied by a private event. Note that they only put up the sign a few hours earlier. It's best to call first to avoid unpleasant surprises!,1
False advertising,They sold us tickets while aware that they would not be able to fulfill the contract on New Years Eve leaving us making other last minute arrangements,1
"Cancelled right before the tour, no alternative.","Our guide Silvia first didn't want to make an invoice for us then stopped replying all together (after we already paid), then a couple of hours before the tour she cancelled without as much as a chat or message. When I chatted her, she answered saying: I have Covid. No other hosts were available and now we need to find a different activity with only hours to go. When I asked if she could send us the list of restaurants etc. so we could do the tour ourselves she send 1 option. Ofcourse if she indeed has COVID she could have cancelled in the morning straight away, or at least send a message with the cancelation. I do not recommend, and we do not feel like this host was in any way honest, authentic or helpful. Terrible, be careful booking Silvia in Lisbon.",1
Unreliable,"They cancelled our food tour at the last minute. The cancellation reason given was that it was due to the guide having ""personal reasons"".

They did not offer an alternative date/time for the tour.",2
Tour cancelled last minute,Booked the 6:30pm food tour months in advance with tour cancelled via email at 2:42pm. Reason given was that it was a public holiday and there were lots of parades. The parades for Freedom Day were concluded that morning. I now question the professionalism of this tour group as this could have been avoided...lucky I just happened to look at my emails. I also wonder how often this has occurred.,1
Was cancelled,"Unfortunately the tour was cancelled at the last minute by the service provider, due to personal reasons. Luckily we got our money back fast.",1
Tours are good - tsunami of review requests afterwards is really annoying,"Unfortunately, I wouldn't use withlocals again. After the tour, you get a tsunami of requests for reviews. It's fair enough that the tour guide asks once but the company becomes insistent. They ask you to review on their platform, then Trip Advisor, then Trust Pilot. Even after I asked them to stop, they emailed twice again tonight asking for reviews here on Trip Advisor, which I had already done.

It's a shame for the tour guides. I would simply contact them individually if I was back in their cities, and cut withlocals completely out of the transaction.",1
Lisbon Day 1 - Private Kickstart tour.,"Very Disappointing. We booked a private guide for a 90 minute tour of the key sites and history of Lisbon through Tripadvisor, rather than the free tours. Our guide Amanda, changed the meeting location of the walk an hour or so before the start to Miradoura Sao Pedro de Alcantara. Ok we thought a different route and more to see. We climb to the start, the guide is 10 mins late, but did let us know and was very apologetic. We set off on a winding walk through the streets of Biarra Alto, Chiado and Biaxa, ending up at the waterfront. whilst the guide was chatty, there was no real structure to the stops, little information on the history etc. Some nice info about current shops and restaurants, but we had to ask to get info. She then finished 15mins early and didn’t go toward the castle where we expected to finish. We learnt more going into the Lisbon Story exhibit at the square for 7€ afterwards than on her tour. For €44 each we would have an expected a more informative guide.",2
Worst food tour ever!,"We were so disappointed by this tour! Firstly, Ana showed up in messy stained clothes that didn't make us feel like this was a professional tour guide at all.

Secondly, while she did show us a couple of nice sites and knew the history a bit, this was a food tour, not a city tour. We only got our first dishes an hour after we met her and it felt like she just randomly chose a restaurant and had us walk in.

When we got there she wasn't sure if the kitchen was open or closed, they initially told her it was closed. She didn't know how to order the food either, we sat there for 20 mins before she realised she had to go to the bar to order food.

She ordered us four tapas, but she never showed us the menu. I saw the receipt when she got it, it was 30 euros.

We were both very hungry after still and thought she'd take us somewhere for a main course. But she informed us it was the 6 tasting tour, but I checked my receipt and said it was the 10, but she said no it was the 6.

I paid £150 for two of us and to get 4 average tapas and then for the apparently '6th' tasting was a pastel de natas from the main shop near Baxia, the one that literally every tourist goes.

I felt like I wasted so much money on this tour. I had done food tours in other places (Venice, Paris etc) and they all cost less and I got way more and way better food!

Imagine a food tour that takes you to one average restaurant for a few starters and for a £1 pastry at the end!!!

That's absurd!!",1
Bad weather alert,"On the day of the tour a bad weather alert was issue, and the tour guide contacted us to propose postponing the tour. While we agreed with the proposal, we couldn’t reschedule it due to our tight itinerary; hence we had to cancel. Now VIATOR said that we are responsible for the cancellation and they won’t do the refund. It is surprising that we are able to manage the weather, I didn’t know that I had that superpower.",1
Disappointing tour- only 3 food stops and guide was late,"Our host was over 30 mins late due to a family emergency. Although she added in a trip on a tram it meant we were running late for our evening reservation and had no time to change in between. I’m not sure it is really a foodie tour, we learned about local history and saw some impressive churches but it wasn’t so food focused. With 6 ‘tastings’ I was expecting 6 different stops for food/drink when in fact there were 3.",2
Awful experience,"Guide over booked. Said he would be an hour late. We waited, never showed up. Sat on steps while trying to connect trip advisor or the local company or the guide. Avoid !",1
Short cancellation notice.,"Short cancellation notice. Based on reviews, think we would have really enjoyed this - but sort of left us in a lurch at the last minute and was notified by email- no phone call.",1
Cancelled the tour 2 minutes out,"They cancelled on me 2 minutes before the tour began. My party and I were already at the meet up point and had planned our whole day around this event. They didn’t provide any notice, explanation, or offer to reschedule. I understand emergencies happen but there was no follow up which was pretty unprofessional.",2
Guide cancelled the morning of our tour on our first day in Lisbon with no effort to rebook us.,"Our guide cancelled the day of our tour with no reason. Found out as soon as I checked in the hotel and had internet. Not a great welcome to lisbon. And no effort at all to have us rebook a tour. We were so looking forward to a private tour and we were willing to pay the extra money.
Why did another person not step in? Why not try to add us to another tour?",1
OUCH,"I wanted a private Tuk Tuk tour of Lisbon but I informed the tour guide that I have Parkinson’s and heart problems. The tour guide continued with the tour, driving over cobblestones and pits in the road. She knew I had medical issues but continued with the tour. Zero out of ten for human concern.",1
Do not take this tour!,"This tour was advertised as 3 hours with a “historic tour of Alfama “ along with the food. Instead it lasted 2 hours ( at 6:30 pm our guide announced it was over- we had started at 4:30). Actually the tour started 20 minutes late because we could not find our guide at the meeting point. We walked all around the Praca ( which was the most unsafe area we felt since being in Lisbon) looking for her or him. We did not receive any communication from her or indication in the instructions how to identify her. I tried messaging her through trip advisor. We finally approached a woman standing alone. She said she tried to telephone us but we didn’t receive anything.
Later, after the tour, on a message came through.
The tour took place near the square and Chiado area, not Alfama! We explained to her we were disappointed in this so she was kind enough to escort us to Alfama after the tour. The food and drink was authentic ( 3 tastings each) but cost about 20 euro and we paid $155 for the two of us!! A complete rip off!

Our guide was lovely and informative but overall this was the worst Trip Advisor tour we have ever been on over the years! Not worth our time or money! We had just done the Guru Walks tour of Chiado, Baixa and Barrio Alto that morning and it was fantastic! Very professional! Plus we didn’t need to be touring around the same area once again in the evening for this food tour.",2
Let Down at the Last Minute,We were really looking forward to this tour and were hugely disappointed when just over an hour before the start our guide said she had to postpone because she was not feeling well which effectively meant we had to cancel. I understand people get ill but surely for a premium price a) we could have had a bit more notice and/or b) there could be a contingency plan. Lisbon is a lovely city with great food though.,1
"Awful service, last minute cancellation","Our guide did not turn up and I totally would not respond to our messages or phone calls. When he eventually did respond, he informed us he had transferred the booking to a colleague and provided his details. We then couldn’t get hold of this colleague either. We have requested a refund. Awful service and we were only able to stay in Lisbon for 2 days.",1
Extremely disappointing and NOT a “food” tour,"We had such high expectations but were sorely disappointed. First the tour company asked us to move our tour time up by an hour which we agreed to accommodate. But then the guide showed up half hour late making us wait. The first hour and half of the tour was walking around the Mouraria historic district which was nice, but not the purpose of the tour. We wanted a food tour. We were expecting 6 tastings at 6 different spots typical to our experiences with other walking food tours in cities like Miami, Chicago, Shanghai but she just took us to 2 spots and all we had was a pork sandwich, a beer, some cheese and bread and scrambled eggs. I’d booked this tour for an “award winning” experience and was hoping to at least sample some seafood and pastel de nata or samosas like we read about in the reviews. I guess it really depends on which guide you get. The experience is not consistent. I wouldn’t recommend this company.",1
Totally disappointing!,"This tour was a waste of money and time. We basically had a pastry, an ice cream, a shot of cherry liquor and a barely edible piece of overly salted, half burnt chorizo as award winning food tour. Our tour guide, Rodrigo, was overly opinionated and not accommodating. He started with telling us how many languages he spoke and where he studied which were totally irrelevant to the tour. When at 12:30 noon he started with pastry and I asked him that we preferred food before dessert, he just continued with the sweets. The next stop after pasties de nata was ice cream and then cherry liquor. The only food we were offered was the chorizo, half of which we did not touch due to being very salty and burnt. He stopped at two hours, despite my ticket clearly stating a 3- hour food. We have had award winning food tours in Barcelona by Withlocals and in Madrid with Devour food and loved both of them. This one was like a bad joke and a true waste of time and money. I am disappointed since it was a tour by Withlocals and we had a great experience with them in Barcelona. I warn travelers to avoid this tour.",1
A scam,"This tour was a scam
We did not get contacted by anyone leading up to it. We arrived at the designated meeting spot 10 min late with no one in sight .
Sadly , a follow up was also not initiated .
Our advice , avoid prepaying …",1
Did not live up to the review.,"The guide asked to delay our tour for one hour, which we agreed to, and then was 40 minutes late on top of that. She took us to a few spots that anyone could easily find and did not add much value in terms of knowledge of the city or food. Overall the tour was overpriced and not for a foodie.",2
Worst experience in all of Portugal,Terrible and boring. Went to one restaurant where our guide ordered a little bit of food for us to taste and the. She asked us where we wanted to go! Worst experience and huge waste of money and time! Do not use this company. They are a huge fraud.,1
WITH LOCALS tour operators are terrible,"I was stood up for this very expensive skip the line with ticket tour. The tour operator, With Locals, never showed. After I texted, called and left a message they finally responded. They could not find a substitute guide. This was the second time in Portugal that we were stood up by WITH LOCALS. I received a message thAT I will receive a refund IN THE FUTURE but I was unable to enter the museum on our last day and our half day was ruined.TripAdvisor would not answer phone.",1
Never Use This Company,"We booked a private tour with Alexandra M for our group of 8 adults for an all day trip. Our guide was not great at communication but I talked to her while in town so thought all was good. I emailed with her the day before asking about pick up location, but no response. So at 11:00 pm the night before our trip I emailed again. Within minutes I got a cancellation email with no explanation. I emailed her asking what was going on but never got a response.
This company ruined our vacation, we had to try and piece together a last minute trip without any help.
Reached out to Withlocals and they said her car broke down and she couldn't rent one, which is a lie. There was a van available to rent, had she contacted us we would have rented the van and we could have gone on our trip.
Withlocals said sorry and offered me a 20% discount, what a joke.
Would never use this company, especially Alexandra M",1
Città Patrimonio UNESCO 🙄🤔😲,"Nulla da disquisire sul patrimonio artistico e naturalistico. Complimenti a coloro che hanno saputo valorizzare al meglio ogni Pianta ed ogni Pietra

Complimenti anche a coloro che hanno trasformato questa cittadina in una efficientissima macchina x mungere soldi ai turisti che la visitano.",1
Stay Away!!,"We had a group of eight booked for an entire day van trip with a local name Alexandra M for almost a month. At 11:30 PM the night before our trip sheet canceled without any notification or further communication. Completely unprofessional, completely worthless the company. Stay away and never use their service.",1
Tours Cancelled,Host cancelled 2 tours with very little notice and only after I contacted them to confirm pick-up details.,2
Short Notice Cancellation,Cancelled with 90 min notice. Finally offered another tour 6 1/2 hrs later. We canceled and toured on our own.,1
COMPANY NOT CUSTOMER ORIENTED,"During my stay in Portugal I planned three trips with this company. The guides were lovely and I enjoyed my time. However, I felt the company lacked any sense of customer service and will never use them again. I had to cancel a tour days in advance because of a train strike, so I asked for a refund. I was disappointed that they would not provide one given the circumstances. However the truly awful part is that the guide agreed to refund his portion. With locals.com suddenly changed their policy so they would not facilitate his portion of the return, despite they take the money and handle the economics. My guide was left struggling trying to figure out how to make the refund happen. Terrible customer Orientation. I no longer trust this company and instead will use airbnb experiences or other competitors",1
They cancelled last minute,Tour company cancelled last minute. Wasted my time and my getting ro the meet up point. They posted the tour was available on the day.,1
We have not received the tiles,"Although Marie Caroline made an effort to attend us on a different date than we had hired, it is also true that she promised to send us the tiles we painted, but it has been three months and we have not received anything yet. Tiles for which we previously pay an extra for having decorations: cork, hanging rope and frames. We have sent several messages and every time we have contacted her she has promised to send them. We feel cheated and ripped off by Marie Caroline. With this comment we just want to draw attention and simply send us what is properly ours. Our next step will be to contact consumer support to reach a more serious claim.",2
Yes to 2 conditions only!!,"The workshop itself is really good. The big problem is after... if you are able to pick up your tiles w days later, everything is fine. If his oven works, everything's fine. If you answer no to one of his conditions... FORGET IT! Run... because you'll be waiting for your tiles a very, very long time. It took months in our case and we had to involve Airbnb because it was part of their experience.",2
"Too much time in the bus, too little time in cities","First off, the tour guide Gui was great, knowledgeable, and very friendly. He was not the issue. The issue is that this tour is completely ill conceived. You'll have 45 minutes in each place, an hour for lunch, and the rest of the day in the bus (which starts at 8am and ends around 8.00-8.30pm). Nazaré isn't even worth seeing unless it's in the winter because the waves are small and oftentimes you can barely see then because of the mist. Obidos and Porto were very nice, I just wish we could've had more time there. My advice: go on a day trip to Porto (or Obidos AND Nazarey if you want), and spend some quality time there. This tour is great if you want to see as much as possible in a superficial way. If you really want to see or experience a place, it's not the best choice.",2
Worst experience ever,"I was probably late for max 5 mins back to our last meeting point in Porto and the guide, the tour, the bus, everyone was gone. I couldn’t reach out to anyone, contact number put me on a voice machine saying not available during non business hours (it was a weekend). So just like that I was left in Porto without any support, no one tried to reach out to me even if they had my numbers and my phone had been available the entire time. And I had to figure out a way to come back to Lisbon. So it’s really a terrible trip ever. I went on many tours everywhere and never had an issue.",1
"This is not what we mean by a ""flight over Lisbon""","What is meant by ""helicopter flight over Lisbon""?

We actually assumed that the flight would take us over the city.
However, it went along the Tagus River towards Ponte 25 de Abril. Shortly before the bridge, the pilot swung to the right and flew back on the other side of the river, facing away from the city.
The pace was very slow, we could see the gas and concrete plants well and for a long time. But not the city.
Well...",1
Money thrown out,"The guides were excellent, but the tour does not explain how little time is in Nazaré, obidos and Porto. We picked Obidos almost all closed and was super rushed to such a beautiful town. Nazareth was open, but also run d+ 45min is nothing of time. As for Porto the logistics very poor tb, 1hr walking tour for 20 to 30min for shopping does not roll. Outside the end of the tour is in an area with far fewer trades than the beginning. The lunch time is short too. I repeat, my critic is the company that created the tour! The guides were some loves.",1
Unprofessional!!! Customer service,"Unfortunately really bad!! Customer service unprofessional!!!!!! If you use this trip you gotta watch your guide if not they leave you, they worry for you money no for give you a tour. I waited on time in the same drop off location and they leaves me with my family in ovidios town. thanks god for the lady in tourist office help us to come back Lisboa, because the customer service's guy from world experience company, he didn't try to help us with information. He only said it's your fault, you have to come back to Lisbon, And hung up the call.
We are tourists, we don't know your language and we pay for see your culture at least have manners with customers!
Very very unprofessional!!!",1
Do not reccomend,"The guide was good, but the trip to Porto is not well organized.
In the most beautiful part of the city, where the bridges are, we spent only 5 minutes, while we crossed the bridge in a hurry!
The tour may be suitable for older people, but for those who can, I recommend visiting Porto on your own (possibly a free local tour).",2
Good knowledge but poor tour route planning,"The tour guide was very knowledgeable, kind and considerate however the structure of the tour was not good. We missed the most beautiful and scenic parts of the city to accommodate older members of the group. Long bathroom breaks again focusing on the comfort and pace of the older members. The trip should allow all to enjoy the what the city has to offer and give recommendations of a more scenic route. If the group consists of many older members who find it difficult to go up hill, then the tour ahould be split to allow other to also visit areas they feel will offer the the full expereince of the city. Honestly i only experienced porto in the last 20 minutes of the tour.",2
An Expensive Bus Ride,"Unfortunately we did not have a good time on the tour. Both operators we nice but the entire tour was set up poorly and was not worth the price. So the whole tour takes 13 hrs start to finish on a bus. From Lisbon, you drive an hour to a small village, you have 40min to walk to a castle and back, really no time to even use a restroom.

Second, you drive another hour, you stop at a fishing village with large waves, another 40min stop where by the time you see the waves you are almost out of time to find a snack or use restroom. Next your are on the bus another 2.5 hrs straight to Porto. This stop you have an hour on your own for lunch at 2pm -3pm. Then about 2 hr walking tour that is nice but no entrances covered or times to go into the sites. So you see a bit of downtown Porto, walk a bridge, and get back on the bus for what is a 4 hr ride back to Lisbon. Out of 13 hrs, you are out of the bus a total of 4.5hrs. Of which there is active instruction while out of the bus for 1.5-2hrs. For the money, it’s essentially a super long round trip bus fare. Just take a train to Porto if you want to see it, maybe stay a night. Its transatlantic amounts of travel (NYC to Lisbon is 8 hrs) and no activities for very high tour price",1
"horrible experience, don’t book if you want to be treated with respect",I have been on a lot of tours in over 20 countries and never have I been treated in the way this tour has. I’ve been on rushed itineraries sure… our group was late to the meeting point once by no more than 5 minutes and were threatened to be left behind in the middle of Portugal because we got slightly lost on the way back. We were again threatened to be left behind because I was in the bathroom for one more minute than they liked after never clearly communicating what time we were supposed to get back on the bus. I understand we have a lot of spots to hit but a lack of basic respect for paying customers after very human and minor delays is unacceptable. I genuinely felt like a 10-year-old on a school field trip rather than a paying adult.,1
Injustice to all 3 cities.,"Our experience with this tour had several challenges that could have been avoided with better organization and communication.

Firstly, the tour operator canceled the tour on our selected date due to low attendance, which was understandable. They kindly emailed us with alternate dates, and we selected a new date. However, we never received a confirmation email for the updated booking. Throughout the process, we continued to receive reminders for the canceled date, and our tickets also displayed the incorrect date. This caused unnecessary confusion and anxiety. It would be helpful if their processes were more streamlined and accurate.

On the day of the tour, the bus was equipped with Wi-Fi and charging ports, but these amenities were only mentioned at the end of the day when the guide asked us to leave a review. Such details should be communicated at the start of the trip so participants can come prepared with necessary items, such as charging cables.

The itinerary also had its flaws. Our first stop was in Obidos at 8:45 a.m., but most places were closed at that time, making the stop feel pointless. In Nazare, we were given very limited time, which meant we couldn’t fully explore the town or take a walk to the beach. Additionally, many stores in Nazare accept cash only—information that would have been helpful to know in advance.

In Porto, the guide walked us through the downtown area and discussed libraries and bookstores. While informative, it would have been better if we were provided with maps highlighting key attractions so participants could explore based on their interests. For instance, there’s a scenic riverside walk and vibrant markets, but we didn’t have enough time to visit them. We also missed the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sunset because of the tightly scheduled itinerary.

Overall, while the destinations were wonderful, the tour’s organization and time management left much to be desired. For those planning to visit these towns, I would recommend renting a car and exploring at your own pace to truly enjoy what each location has to offer.",2
"Poor, since you cancelled the tour and did not notify me.","This trip was canceled, but we were never informed. I only discovered it was canceled when they did not complete our payment the day before the tour.
Very disappointing.",1
Not to repeat,"It was an excursion in Spanish. When we reach the meeting point we see many English speakers. It turns out that they have made a mixed group with the two languages, but the guide Rui had a very low level of Spanish and throughout the day (13 h) has completely ignored the Spanish-speaking group. It's been really nasty.
On the other hand the stops of Obidos and Nazaré have been very uninteresting and in Porto although we have been received by another guide (Francis) for the Spanish-speaking group we have been only two hours, to everything run and without time for anything.
13 hours listening to conversations in English, not understanding anything, having paid for an excursion in Spanish.",1
Improveable,"Visit very quickly. If I had thought better I would not have bought it.
The Rui guide has perfect command of English but his Spanish makes him feel uncomfortable. The English speakers may have been fine, but I'm not so good.
With them complicity and great paraphrases summarized in little Spanish.
Francisco fine, but visit cuto jogging.
Without acrimony, you can improve with two independent guides and transmitters.",2
PAINFUL,"We have had our booking cancelled a day before travelling to Lisbon, not least to make this excursion. The excuse, which they have not provided until we have called is painful: helicopter check. All ??? two days before the booked date ??....",1
Too rushed. Not enough time to enjoy the day,To much to enjoy in one day. Should make it shorter or extend the time..... maybe two days. Too much to do in one day. Maybe Porto only.,2
Excursion to Porto City,"We lacked the emotion of the city of Porto. 30 minutes to visit one street is nothing at all. You shouldn't go on a trip like this. Waste of a day.
On the plus side, the city is Nazaré. Unusual beauty views.",2
"Not great, not terrible","The tour from Lisbon to Porto had a few strong points but also some notable downsides.

Positive Aspects:

• The guide, Ruy, was knowledgeable and answered all the questions thoroughly, explaining the main attractions in detail.
• The bus driver was polite and drove carefully throughout the journey.
• Ruy was attentive to tourists’ safety, reminding everyone to keep track of their belongings and be mindful of their seating to avoid disturbing others.
• He provided useful information about restroom stops, which was helpful during the trip.

Areas for Improvement:

• Unfortunately, Ruy was hard to spot during the tour as he didn’t wear a distinctive outfit, hat, or carry anything like an umbrella. This made it easy to lose track of him in the crowd.
• He tended to focus more on engaging with the American tourists, which made others feel a bit overlooked.
• There were instances where tourists were inconsiderate, such as sitting with their feet outside their seats and eating with their hands during the lunch break in Porto. This wasn’t addressed effectively.
• The guide at Óbidos was just average, and the same could be said about the Nazare stop. There was nothing particularly special at these locations, and the lack of toilet access without cash was inconvenient.
• In Porto, the guide moved too quickly, making it hard to follow him, especially with no water breaks. He relied on hand gestures that were difficult to understand from the back.
• The lunch provided in Porto was quite disappointing. For a group of five, the portions were meager (one sausage, five calamari, small chicken rolls, olives, and stewed chicken gizzard that went untouched). You were only offered one drink, and if you expected both wine and water, you’d be disappointed. With just an hour to eat, it would have been better to dine at a nearby restaurant for better quality at a similar price.

Overall, while Ruy’s efforts were appreciated, there’s room for improvement in how the tour is conducted and the overall experience provided to guests.",2
Pretty Disappointed,We showed up 30 mins early. 2 other couples also waiting. No email from the tour operator. No texts from the tour operators. Cancelled due to wildfire smoke. Had to go to the messages section of our booking to find out. No answer on the phone line. No answer on the messaging system. No information on refunds. Very poor communication.,1
waste of time and money,"I chose it to get to know some places outside Lisbon, learn some history and decide whether to visit those cities more in depth later. But the history was not actual history (eg ""that book shop was in a Harry Potter movie"", ""there is a McDonald's with an eagle statue on it""). We were supposed to have a pre-organised lunch but the guide forgot to organise it in advance. He sent everyone to find a restaurant, get & each lunch within an hour. It was impossible with a bus load of people, who basically chose the same 4 small restaurants in the square, thus overwhelming the kitchens -- some of us didn't even get served and had to have no lunch for such a long day. There was no visit of anything remotely port-related in Porto. No seeing big waves nor the fort in Nazaré. Bad translations by the guide. A rip off. Óbidos was pretty and we went early, missing the crowds, so I give a point for that",2
Too much for one day,"I will start by saying that I did not read the details as tours were booked by another in our party.

If you wish to drink Port in Porto or experience the city, this tour is not for you. My personal opinion, trying to do three cities in one day is cheating yourself of truly enjoying the city.

Porto needs more than 3 hrs to enjoy, Nazare needs at least 2 to 3. Same with Obidos.

This is a very rushed walking tour. Our guide was almost militant, but I guess he had to be to manage a group of 25 in a busy city. Yesterday we did Fatima, Nazare and Sintra with the same guide, 9 folks total, and he was much more laxed.

Obidos is a beautiful town, the castle is underwhelming, but something you can skip if you are pressed for time.

Nazare, large waves are Nov to Mar. Any other time, you are visiting a quaint beach town with some historical value. Be warned, the same guy who manages the public restroom, works in the church, so if you have to go, you may spend all your time in the coffee shop to buy something so you can use the bathroom.

2hr drive from Nazare to Porto, get ready for some zzzs.

So, the food upgrade (i don't recommend it)...staff was friendly but some guests were not necessarily comfortable with sharing tapas with strangers. Maybe something for the planners to consider when picking restaurants. We had two vegetarians in our party and their food was extremely disappointing. Food should have included port tasting (THIS IS WHAT TOURIST COME HERE FOR)

The walking tour was rushed in my opinion. I spent too much time concerned with not keeping up, rather than enjoying the city. I also noticed we did not go into anything with an entrance fee.

I learned that this is rushed because the driver cannot work for more than 12 hours. If this is true, would 2 drivers work? One to head up, one to head back. Add at least an hour to Porto, so folks can relax and enjoy port tasting and the city views (which are beautiful)

Maybe something in here helps those who are trying to decide yay or nay.",2
"Unreliable, cancelled a few hours before the activity.","Cancelled the day before 2pm. Unreliable. After having many plans in coordination with this activity, we had to spend a lot on reorganizing the agenda.",1
Don’t build your hopes up,"I must start by saying “disappointed”. To explain this, well the itinerary is not what we actually got.

Firstly, we stood around the meet point with no sign of the guide as he wasn’t identifying himself well, turned out he was sat at a table by McDonalds. Ok so once we got the group together we moved off on the walking tour part, not really informative unless you count here’s a church that burnt down, this is a nice restaurant, and more randomness. I will add there was some history included but at a minimum. Where was the famous Elevador da Gloria, Calcada da Gloria - oh yeah we were told it’s over there but we’re not going on it and because of that we didn’t see the Miradouro Sao Pedro de Alcantara. Next we’re was the Church of St. Roque - who knows because we certainly didn’t see it. Then we didn’t see the Convento do Carmo.

Next we head to the main square to go on the boat which the guide sat in silence throughout not pointing out anything!

Off the boat and a brief walk to a minibus to take us on the helicopter. Well that was following the theme of the day. Literally take off left, head over the river, see the bridge land. If we were airborne 4 minutes I’d be surprised so no fantastic pictures of Lisbon to be had.

Once on the ground, ushered into the minibus before being asked where we wanted dropping (thought the decision was actually made for us after the guide kept saying you should see the monastery) so everyone was dropped there and that was that.

Very disappointed as we were both looking forward to the trip as it ticked (according to the itinerary) what we wanted having only 2.5 days in Lisbon. I’m guessing the day comes down to which guide you get as to how informative, close to the schedule and generally good it’ll be.",2
On a tour in minimal Spanish!,"We booked a tour of the three cities for two, a friend and me, the tour was in English and Spanish, the guide Rui was very friendly, but unfortunately the contributions in Spanish went from being very few to almost nothing! Sadly, this frustrates the experience of a tourist who hopes to get closer to the culture, preferably in a more familiar language.",2
Trip to Porto,"The places were amazing. There was not enough time in each place. I felt rush and could not enjoy what each place has to offer. For these long trips, please have the option to use a bathroom",2
Cancelled without apology or explanation,"Our tour (scheduled for 13 April 2024) was suddenly cancelled at 7pm on the evening before, with no apology or real explanation given. (The email said ""unsuitable or dangerous weather"", but it was actually a perfectly nice spring day.) They are only reachable by phone until 6pm, so we could not even contact them to ask for an explanation and to inquire if there are any alternative options. We understand that tours might have to be cancelled for various reasons, but in such cases we expect much better communication!",2
Very bad experience!,"The event that was specially arranged for Valentine's Day was simply cancelled the day before - reason: bad weather! I'm not a pilot - but we had very nice (not windy) (flying?!) weather here!

We were extremely disappointed!",1
Total letdown,"So very disappointed! Booked to go to Lisbon for Valentine’s Day, flights & hotel, bought this excursion, a bucket list entry with the helicopter ride & for the perfect Valentine’s. They cancelled last minute. No option to do any part of the tour.",1
No Guide no Flight…,"Check In 8.45 AM - at 9.45 AM still no guide and no information by the operator. 16 people waiting in front of a McDonald on 31st of December …
At least a very quick refund confirmation.",1
"Great spots to visit, not happy with tour company","We visited some beautiful places but the bus driver drove way too fast-I know he had a lot of ground to cover but we started off about 45 minutes late as the bus didn’t arrive and we all wondered if they had forgotten about us!! The tour leader was nice but not good at handling a crowd of people or even one on one. Possibly he was new-or having an off day-he had potential but too wimpy.
We were actually frightened by the bus driver. He was snarky and drove way too fast in the rain-it was pouring! And he drove the bus weaving in and out of traffic on the freeway in the pouring rain. We asked him to slow down but he didn’t and told us he was a great driver and the tour guide did not help us-just said we have to get back in time! We felt that it was dangerous and we were definitely scared with our eyes pressed shut and stomach in knots!
The biggest problem for our group and all the others we spoke to was the place they dropped us for lunch. Here we are in Porto-a city full of fabulous restaurants and they drop us in a weird area with 2 cheap and really horrible lunch counters and nowhere else to eat-also given 35minutes to eat. The food was cheap and I travel all over the world and I can usually find something to eat anywhere-but this food was just horrible. I ordered 2 things-a sandwich and a soup-both were so bad I couldn’t eat them-and this was a long day with no food. I ended up eating a choc eclair -that wasn’t very good either! I was not alone in my experience and both restaurants were equally bad. I asked the tour guide why they picked this corner and was told that this location worked because of our next activity and bus parking. I actually contacted the tour company with my concerns and suggestions for a couple of restaurants that were on their route which would work better. (Which I looked for while we there and ran past the tour guide and read their reviews hoping to help the next poor group have a decent meal!! I have led a few tours myself.) No response from the tour company to this day! He didn’t even care enough to answer me.

As I said-the places we visited were lovely, but I would suggest taking a train ride and doing your own tour. The walking tour in Porto was pretty good.

I would not recommend this tour!",2
Appalling,"Too bad, because I can't give it 0 stars, otherwise I would. We paid for a tour in Spanish and it was in English, my parents don't know English and they didn't know anything. After insisting to the guide, he translated something into Portuguese, which is also not Spanish and my parents still didn't understand... The guide's explanations (in English) were simple and without any kind of interest, it is as if I, without any kind of knowledge , I started to take a tour, he said things that were obvious and without any type of historical value. The tour was very uncoordinated, we did not visit Sintra, but instead we went to spend 40 minutes at his friend's bakery. As a positive point, at the winery the girl who gave us the explanation was doing everything possible to make us feel comfortable (although she didn't know Spanish and everything was in Portuguese, so we still had the same handicap). On the way back, the guide intended to leave us with the bus at the other end of the city, although it clearly stated that the arrival location was the same as the pickup location. I do not recommend it at all, it has been very disappointing and very expensive for the service received.",1
DO NOT TAKE THESE TOUR,"Nothing like in the description
We were in Porto just 2 hours
No free time at all in Porto
Tour guide 1 hour and 15 minutes only
I wish I can get a refund
The worse tour I have ever taken",1
Not recommended - cancellation risk,"This trip was booked in advance and payment taken. Confirmation was received that the trip would go ahead the day before so everything looked OK.
Then I received a What’sApp message from the company asking if we could move to another day as ‘there was a logistics problem’ on the day we wanted to go (a Saturday morning). Evidently the problem couldn’t be resolved that day but would definitely be resolved the next day if we wanted to change. This wasn’t possible as we were leaving the next day so cancelling was the only option given to us.
This was the second time that this happened while on this trip in Portugal (last minute contact from the tour operator via WhatsApp saying there was a problem but it would be OK the next day - after taking payment AND confirming the day before and tickets being issued) and is most likely the operator having an offer to take more people (we are a couple travelling) so dumping our trip at the last minute leaving us with little option to find a replacement.
Be cautious when booking with this company if your plans are not flexible or if you are a couple!",1
É um desperdício de tempo e de dinheiro - podia antes fazer algo de bom na cidade.,"Infelizmente, fiquei muito desiludido. Tudo começou com o facto de não podermos ir de barco e de não podermos ver a praia. Depois, houve também o facto de só termos estado na praia com os cavalos durante 5 minutos e não termos podido tirar fotografias. Tirámos fotografias, mas quiseram cobrar 15 euros por fotografia. Tinha de se estar sempre em fila e não se podia andar muito afastado da barraca. Não me pareceu que as pessoas que lá estavam soubessem realmente o que estavam a fazer. Eu sentei-me no cavalo mais rápido e tive de andar atrás de todos os outros. Por isso, foi muito cansativo para mim e nada divertido. Depois fomos ao mercado do peixe, onde não pudemos comer nada porque tudo estava a fechar lentamente e não havia muitas opções. Também fomos a um castelo onde ninguém nos conseguiu dizer nada. Em suma, foi um desperdício de dinheiro para mim.",1
Don't bother!,"This trip was unsatisfying and also misrepresented. We had an extremely punctual group, and the trip extended to 13.5 hours. I doubt it actually ever finishes earlier just based on doing the math of where we went. We didn't grasp the very limited itinerary of this tour (our fault!) but we were in a bus for over 9 hours to see three places for 45 minutes, 45 minutes, and then two hours in Porto that included a 30 minute lunch, a one hour walking tour, and then 30 minutes at the end to try port.. The tour guide gave us only 30 minutes for lunch at a terrible area for food - the food equivalent of a crappy gas station. It was highly unsatisfying because we didn't have time to appreciate anything, the bus air condition was unreliable, and the food was awful. The one redeeming quality is the tour guide did dispense some good historical knowledge on the bus and on the walking tour, but the tour overall was of cheap quality. If I were to do it again, I would simply go to Porto for an overnight at least. Not worth it for the price!",2
"nice personell but ""määääh"" experience regarding the monuments","The offered trip (7 Minutes) obviously is very short.

If you expect anything as shown in the advertised pictures of this trip or written in the description ( Belém Tower, Jerónimos Monastery, 25Th April Bridge, close view of the Christ King Monument ) you have to bring binoculars.

It is basically a lift off, flying a couple of 100 m to the middle of the river and then going down again. no close view of the Christ, not even flying nearby the bridge.
If I'd be mean I'd say ""luxurious elevator"".

So you see everything in distance - but nor really. The only thing you see is the industrial harbour.

you should def. book a longer tour (15 min).

The pilot and owner of the business are very kind and funny people though, that's worth the 2 stars :-)",2
Exceptionally poor communication and horrible experience,"I'm not sure where to even begin to say how disappointing this experience was that I never actually even got to go on.

I had bought three tickets for myself, my wife, and my infant son, my confirmation explicitly stated two adults and one infant. On the day of the tour we painstakingly got my son ready for an 8AM departure, we got to the bus, only to find that there was no car seat for my son to sit in the bus. After some back and forth, we were told they could not accommodate us. We offered that we had our own car seat available at the hotel we stayed at a few minutes away. We were told the driver was not willing to take the risk.

Fine. Thoroughly disappointing on its own, but mistakes happen, I get it.

I wrote to the tour operator about how disappointing it was to have an entire day of your vacation ruined, at a time where it's far too late to even book another tour for the day to be salvaged.

Late afternoon that same day, I was offered by text message either a refund, rebooking the tour at a later date, or a different tour. Of course, time is of the essence, these tours get booked up and I didn't want to miss out on a chance to go on a tour, I responded within 30 minutes to rebook for a day later in the week.

I didn't hear anything back for the rest of the day, I didn't hear anything back the next morning. I messaged them myself almost 24 hours later saying I received no correspondence, and that I booked another tour elsewhere. Only then did I receive a response saying sorry for the delay.

I asked for a refund, and for once in this whole ordeal, something was done promptly and properly - I received notification of a refund being processed.

Folks, vacations are short, and having an entire day ruined and missing out on an experience is not a headache you want to be dealing with.

Based on my own horrible experience, I accordingly strongly caution anyone that is considering booking this tour.",1
Not happy at all,"We buy online and then they cancel. And messed up our 3 days vacation.shame on website.

Not worth the money,The tour guide took us to the most boring parts of porto including a McDonald’s she thought was really pretty. She clearly wasn’t knowledgeable about the history of Porto. It is not worth the money. If they were to do one stop before Porto instead of two and gave us more time in Porto it would have been more worth it…. Plus having a knowledgeable tour guide would have helped too.,1
Uncomfortable for hours!!!,"I loved the 3 places, our tour guide was ok, but what made the day awful was the 16 person tour van. You could not see out any windows, it had zero shocks I knew the driving time would be long.. that being said the seating on the van was sooooooo bad. The four of us are average sized adults, all 6’ and under, less than 180 pounds and we were stuck in the very back 4 person row. The seats in front of reclined, ours were straight and tilted forward. I am not exaggerating when I say we were slammed completely up against the seats in front of us. You could not move or adjust to get comfortable. On a city tour where you are in and out, moving it would be fine but we were in the van for 2hrs, another 2hrs and then the 4 hour trip from Porto back to Lisbon. This was waaaaaaaay to long for the back row seating. This tour should not be done in this vehicle. I would NOT recommend this tour at all! 45 mins in Obidos, 30 mins Nazare and 2 1/2 hours in Porto. Lastly I wish we would not have gone on this tour. I guess I can say I have been to these places but definitely did not really experience anything.",2
The boat with no return,"Very dissatisfied. Apparently, there was priority boarding for large groups with a guide, which meant we couldn’t get a seat on the upper deck – all seats were already taken. As a result, we were forced to sit inside. Unfortunately, the view from inside is significantly worse than from the upper deck, partly due to the dirty windows, which made it difficult to enjoy the surroundings. When we got off in Belém and wanted to return at 5 PM, the boat didn’t stop to pick us up, despite earlier information from the info kiosk indicating otherwise. Upon inquiry in Belém, we were informed that the boat would not be stopping there at 5 PM that day. Fortunately, the train was still running, and we were able to return that way.",1
Disappointment!!!,"It's not worth it! For what it costs and don’t bother, the boat is old, and all it does is take a walk along the river for 1 hour with little explanation and stops you in belem. It doesn't meet expectations at all.",1
Don’t Bother,"Very disappointing particularly the so called snacks & drink. The snacks were 4 small crackers & dodgy fish paste, ended up being ill during the night & I can only attribute this to the fish paste. The wine was one very small plastic glass from a wine box.",1
Watch out if you're not a priority,"Exclusive schedules are saved to go with Guide so if there are already few options all counts that they are even less.
Disappointed 😞",2
Very bad,"Very bad. We were first in the queue to go up and they let ""their"" groups go first... and sit in the best seats... We all paid the same amount... and when we asked for clarification... the answer was that they didn't know anything. NOT recommended..",1
Don't do it. There are better providers,"Absolute rip-off. You get a small glass of port and a bad sweet pie. A joke for the money.
The solo entertainer was the only thing that made the tour enjoyable. He sang nice songs.",1
Very sad trip,"Our only dissapointing experience in Lisbon. Windows were filthy (it had been a few days of beautiful sunshine previously so no need for dusty rain marks).
Loo bins overflowing with rubbish.
Audio guide played in multiple languages in succession so not a great deal of info as you had to wait for your language to come back round.
Overall just a sad and tired experience which we wished we hadn't wasted a couple of hours on.",2
"Poor experience, not enough buses.","Very poor experience. Be aware buses are not every 30 minutes (approx). They only had 2 buses running, and when both were going the other way, I called support and after stating my situation, no bus my way for 1 hour, I didn't even get an apology.
Ask how many buses are on route. Red bus tour we saw quite a few, seemed to have more buses. I do not recommend.
Canadian.",1
Too bad.,"Terrible. They take a long time to pass, it has no air conditioning so the heat was hellish, and the tour leaves much to be desired. The biggest waste of time and money.",1
,"We were very disappointed. Hardly any information, and with a city that has so much history. In some cases, the scant information did not come in the right places. All in all, very skinny. Not recommended",1
Bad option,Very bad option. Really long time waiting for each bus. The red bus is much better. I don’t recommend yellow bus at all. In one of the stops we waited almost one hour in a really Hot day.,2
Too much waiting was painful,"Very few buses , too much waiting we wasted our time waiting for the bus more than 50 minutes to 1 hour of wasted time under the July sun. I strongly advise the other company the red bus was quite the opposite the red buses run every 15/ 20 minutes",2
Bad experience with Yellow HOHO at Lisbon,"We did not have a nice experience. On 29/5/25(booked 15/4/25) , I had booked for self & my wife for 48 hrs - with Tram & Boating.
In effect, we could do just 2 tours --same Belen Tower route.
At the Terminus, there was none to guide,,no displays & a driver misguided into taking the same route book, after waiting for 25m in Sunday..
There's no info counter to check on Boat or Tram.. As a tourist from different country who has toured the globe, I didnot relish the experience and wish you to take collective action..
And stops to be displayed prominently. We took a Cab , went to j. Monastery. After that, it took 20 mins to enquire & search for a yellow bus stop.",2
Yellow bus . Use competitor as this is so bad..,"1.30hr wait time, then had to stand. 22e. Do not use. Other similar bus services far more regular. Stay away.. plus bus kept letting people on.. why.. no one could use audio, plus just made more already squeezed people more uncomfortable....",1
Terrible terrible experience,The only reason it got one star is because I couldn't give it zero. This is an absolutely awful experience. You see very little of interest in lisbon. Plus on the bus we were on the audio did not work so there is no actual tour. You didn't know where you were or what you were seeing additionally the driver was so poor that it ended up taking nearly an hour longer than it should have. Avoid at all costs,1
Terrible tour,"Terrible tour. How could they not have know the downtown core had a major bike race ! Had to be rerouted, missed a lot of attractions. Commentary recording was so off, talked about a fountain that never came into view and numerous other sites of note. Very disappointing!",1
Don’t bother,"We first did this trip in 2024 and really enjoyed it. Back in Lisbon in 2025 we thought we’d do it again - big mistake.
This year it is about half the length of last year - the whole second section is missing. Also, the trip operates in reverse, so you approach the cathedral from the back, not the front, for example.
Such a shame, don’t waste your money, we wish we hadn’t.",2
Disappointing Experiance,The driver we had sped around the town. Stopped for a very short time at the stops. No good photo opportunities. Very disappointed.,2
Worst European city bus tour ever,This bus tour was terrible! Avoid the RED GRAYLINE tour-the tour information is poor quality & quantity & it often told us after the stop what was at the previous one at which point it was too late to get off & explore! We also waited >1.5hrs at the castle & no bus showed up despite it apparently being every 20mins. Rip off for what it was. Worst bus tour in a European city I have ever done,1
Very bad,Totally useless experience. 50 euros for two people thrown for a ride on narrow streets in the middle of social housing. The basilica of course you can see only the lower part being inside a vehicle. Not recommended,1
Worst experience ever,"The route was terrible, there was nothing interesting but garbage and wood... As Portuguese it is shameful to show this route to tourists because those who do not get Lisbon with this route continues without knowing it. It was terrible.",1
Beware of the queues,Once we go on the bus it was excellent but we had to queue at the main pick up point at Parco da Figueira in the heat for 30 minutes and not be able to get on the bus which was full. We were then told it would be a further hour for the next bus as there had been a breakdown. Staff were not especially helpful. We came back much later in the day and that was fine.,2
Very very bad. Standing tall in the aisles is your destiny when you book this tour.,A wait of half an hour was no exception. Once the bus arrives there is no room on it. Definitely NOT worth its money,1
Do NOT trust this company.,"Total scam. We were on a cruise ship and upon arrival at port the yellow bus flag was up however the bus did not show up. After waiting more than a hour we made several calls to the company however the calls were forwarded to Porto. We eventually reached out to the local police officer her confirmed that the company was on strike. We were only at port one day so we had to purchase on another bus line. The bus line was overcrowded, overbooked. It was a horrible experience. After several calls to the yellow bus company they said we would receive a refund but would need to request it through Viator. We requested but they refused the refund stating they opened back up at 2 pm. We knew at 3:30 pm they had not reopened however even if they did open at 2 pm how could they provide a 24 hour tour? Do not trust this company",1
Cancellation,I was unable to use the ticket as my mum was unwell. I have been in contact many times aa it says you have a 14 day cancellation policy on your website but am yet to hear back.,1
Waste of money,"A joke and complete waste of my money and time. We were waiting for more than 2 hours.
disaster, the bus is full, there is no bus in sight for an hours. ADVICE, DO NOT BUY YELLOM BUS TKURS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. It's ist disaster. Bye",1
A disaster - “hop on” impossible!,"We were so excited for a day in Lisbon with our children who are 7 and 4. We thought that the yellow bus would be the perfect way to get around so we could see lots and the children wouldn’t have to walk very much.

We got to stop 5 and up until that point enjoyed the bus very much. However after 30 mins in the park we couldn’t get back on the bus when it arrived as there were no seats. The driver told me I needed to wait 30 mins for another bus - but with no guarantee we would get on that. We ended up walking two tired and hot children all the way back to the start without seeing what we had planned. Everyone is so disappointed and what a complete scam and waste of money!",1
Unpredictable schedule,"The buses were extremely late, and there were no seats for elderly in the bus stop
Stuff was friendly? But the service is unoresictable",1
Beware Lisbon traffic,"Unfortunately the current traffic chaos in Lisbon makes the tour bus impractical to use on a day visit (e.g. from a cruise ship). We opted for this trip from the terminal which required going to the bus tour hub at the top of Lisbon.

We changed buses to pick up the route and left fairly promptly, but an hour in we were only 3 stops around the 28 stop route, and would have been tight for the 1600 back aboard, so we abandoned at stop 5 or 6. We had a short stroll to the river and the ship was only 300 metres away. We then had a lovely coffee and a pastel de natal and stroll around the immediate area with its lovely squares.",2
"Terrible service, dreadful experience.",This tour was the worst bus ride I've ever been on. The journey was boring the driving horrendous. We were charged for a 48 hour ticket and were only in port for several hours. I would like to deter people from taking this tour as when I contacted the company to complain I was ignored.,1
Yellow bus sucks,"Unfortunately, this was a terrible experience. We found the bus stop after buying our tickets, then waited for over an hour. More than 12 Red busses came by, but there were no yellow busses. I called the company and was lied to. The representative said that the busses were all delayed, but it didn't seem to bother the red bus company. He said that the bus would arrive in 9 to 10 minutes, but it didn't show up for over 20 minutes. We wasted 2 hours of our vacation time.",1
Do not do the 'Modern' Tour.,"Whatever you do, do not pay for the 'modern' tour-it's just a bus ride to the airport and all you see is shipping containers. Just pay for the Belem tour, which is nice. It's a basic, pre-recorded audio so you won't learn much. Just use it as a convenient, flexible way to travel.",2
Don't get off 'cause then you can't go back,"Even though they say you can go up and down, it's a lie. We took the boat at 11 a.m. and went to Belem, for the return there were no boats to stop, we were told that we had to return by bus, metro, train or other means. Come on, it was a hoax. You just have the one-way boat trip and then I'll look for life to come back. By the way the QR that is supposed to get you for Carries transports for 24h, the drivers of that company do not even know what you talk about when you show them the ticket, but because they are so kind they let you pass. Not recommended the tour, unless you don't get off",1
Just don’t! Go with red Hop on hop off.,Sold us two day tickets without me anything about routes being interrupted due to holiday. Ended up walking 1.5 miles up hill to get to the first operational pickup spot. Music was pretty terrible and guide less than informative. Only stop if you hit the red button (none upstairs). Was quicker to get downstairs and let the driver know. All together very disappointing!,2
Bad services,"The experience was very frustrating and disappointing. The bus was supposed to run every 30 min. However, we had to wait for the bus for almost 1 hr on the way to Belem. The driver didn't inform us that stops 11, 12, and 13 were closed due to construction. We along with some other people were waiting for more than 1 hr at stop 11 for the bus to come on the way back to Lisbon. The bus never came. We finally decided to go back to stop 10. We waited for the bus for another hour. It was a very frustrating experience, as we were tired and lost about 3 hrs of our day.",2
Not recommended,"Not recommended! Unimportant information while driving on shopping and hotels.
Important stops in Belem 11, 12, 13 are not served without notice. Only a small note on the bus and when scanning arrival times knows.",1
Poor information dissemination and management,"Very poor information. We bought the tickets but were NOT told that the bus would not stop at what were stops 11, 12, 13, 14 on the blue route. Only when we asked the bus driver were we directed to a sign pasted on the bus window downstairs, facing outward, with no way for people to know as they boarded from the angle they did. The commentary does not let you know which stop you’re at which makes it difficult to trace whether or not the bus is at the place it claims to be. Had to constantly refer to Google maps in order to work out where we were whenever things didn’t match up (likely due to traffic and other things like skipped stops!!). Speaking of the audio commentary, earphones are just placed in a box behind the first seat as you board and are not very noticeable. We missed it as did other much more elderly passengers whom we had to help with it later, going down below to retrieve earpieces. Also several of the audio plugins didn’t work so passengers had to change seats to find those that did work. Truly regret buying this bus tour, perhaps try the other companies but not this one that severely lacks information and misrepresents itself.",1
Bellem tour,"We’ve been waiting 75 minutes for our Yellow bus at stop 14 on the Bellem Lisbon tour and still nothing. Five red buses have already passed. Normally scheduled every 30 minutes...
When I post this message i.e. more than 80 minutes still no bus ... I advise against, take the competition Red.",2
Dont ever think to get on tram 28.. take a bus going to castle,"İt is impossible to get on tram 28. You have to wait for more than 2 hrs.. instead we took tuk tuk which is expensive, 90 euros for two people for 90 min.. you have to bargain.. after waiting 2 hrs you lose your energy and time to get around",1
Don’t pay on card use cash so your sure you have not been overcharged and ripped off,I was charged for 2 people when I said a ticket for 1 when I asked for a refund I was told they don’t and I class that as stealing the man who charged me said he doesn’t understand ticket for 1 the guy was talking utter crap.,2
Don't lose your ticket!!!!,"I had worse 3 48h tickets.
The first round is not very interesting.
Today, wanting to go back, for the second round (2 days validity) I was able to repay the 3 tickets because I had misplaced the ticket the day before.
I find this slightly exaggerated and not commercial.
I had proof that our 48-hour ticket had started the day before.
This leaves a bitter taste (and 50€ in the wind)
Good hearing.",2
Yellow Bus is not worth the money,"The bus was overcrowded the first day. The second day we waited one hour at the Tile museum, finally getting an Uber instead.
The red buses seemed to come and go on their expected schedules. Yellow bus was a disappointment in an otherwise great trip to Lisbon. We ended up using Ubers almost everywhere.",1
Would not recommend.,Was told the tram was not running and then saw it later and people were squeezed in like sardines. Not safe or enjoyable. Bus stops are so far apart we ended up taking taxis in between.,2
"If take a bus, wait for at least 2 hours",Bus punctuality is appalling. Waited for more than 2 hours to arrive at ipoh. Bus from permata utara. How malaysia can progress with such lousy bus system,1
We did not get off until the end. Would not recommend the big yellow bus tour.,It wasn’t very informative and the music was terrible. I would not recommend. We took a tram the next day it was a fun journey.,2
"How can they make something so straightforward, so bad.","I will take you through the whole experience and you can judge it. It's a hop on hop off bus, it was going to most of the things we wanted to see, it was the cheapest bus, what can go wrong... Booking was straightforward, paid online and got a token thing on my phone. Arrived at praca de Figueira and got directions to the bus from a stallholder. Got to the bus, we were going to do the blue route, spoke to a bus driver, showed him the token thing on my phone and he gave us two tickets, two sets of ear phones, a route map and warned us about pickpockets at the stops. All good so far. Got to our seat and plugged the earphones in, went to number 2 for English speakers. There was very annoying music playing but I thought it would stop when we started moving, but it didn't . We wanted off at stop two. I took my earphones out as I could not stand the music, my wife did also, as did the majority of the passengers. I usually like to hear the commentary but the music interspersed with it made it too annoying to listen too. Anyway, we waited for the 2nd stop. After a while , and the bus not stopping I Iistened to the commentary again and realised we were coming to stop 5!!!. The bus does not stop at every stop, it only stops if you press the stop button. But if you don't know where you are, you don't know when to stop. Anyway my wife and I and another couple we didn't know got off at this stop. We asked the driver why he hadn't stopped and he told us he doesn't stop if he doesn't need too. The driver said another bus would be along in thirty minutes. We looked around stop 5 ( waste of time) and got back on the next bus. We told the bus driver we wanted off at stop 11, he said we had to listen to the commentary and press the button when we wanted to stop. Anyway, we could not listen to the incredibly annoying music and we got off at stop 7. We walked around there fir thirty minutes and got the next bus. I'd had enough by this time and just wanted taken back to the square so I could enjoy my day, walking about. Got on the bus, did the whole route and then it made one stop. Nobody in the bus had their earphones in. We waited to get to Praca de Figueira, but it doesn't stop there, it stops nearby. Well we didn't know and the driver never said. Everybody on the top of the bus stayed on, nobody, I repeat nobody had their earphones in. The bus stayed going again and we waited for the square. After several minutes I noticed stop 5 again!!! Myself and my wife and another two couples got off, we spoke to the other people, they had not been listening to the commentary/music and had no idea where they were either. Anyway we walked back to the square ( 35 minutes).
This bus tour is rubbish, the drivers are lazy and don't even bother to let you know you are at the start or finish of the route. Avoid, avoid avoid this yellow hop on hop off bus .",1
Super Shabby Service!!,"We took the boat tour and got off at Belem at 3:30 pm for a bite to eat after being told we could hop on again at 5:30 pm. After waiting for 15 minutes at 5:30 and with no boat in sight, we wandered into the ferry office and were told the 5:30 boat would not be coming. The fellow who worked for the ferry company and not yellow bus tours had no information for us only that there would be no more yellow boats that day. Pretty shabby service stranding your customers!! Won’t ever use this company again.",1
Doesn't stop at stops just drives past,Buses drivers don't stop and ignore passengers at stop will never use again very poor service waste of money as do not deliver should be called do not hop on and of,1
Very poor,This was a tour to see blocks of flats. I would NOT recommend to modern tour at all.if you need to get to the tile museum and aquarium get a taxi,1
City cancelled the AEROBUS service to and from the Bus Depot at 7 Rios,"UNFORTUNATELY this good service was discontinued. They City of Lisbon) have also prohibited REDE EXPRESSOS to make a stop near the terminal to disembark passengers! Whatever is good and safe for passengers the City find a way to cancel!!!!! Best and safest way from LIS airport to the Bus Station is a taxi, about 10 euros!",1
Save your money & get a tuk tuk,"Red line? I’d draw a big red line through it! We do the tours in every city we visit to get a feel for the place & this one is THE worst! Seriously we’ve never had one like it. Lisbon has super history & places but boy what did you do? Virtually no commentary, consistently long stops & as for the ignorance of some of your staff. Shocker!",1
A scam,I bought the 72 hours pass. I’ve looking for buses or tram to give the service I’d paid for. In the last couple hours “all the buses and tram” are out of service. There’s no warning in the web page and no one from customer service (the people who activates the vouchers) can give any explanations.,1
Please use this bus tour with caution,"Very Dangerous, please use with extreme caution.

My husband and I purchased a ticket for the modern bus tour as we wanted to visit the Oceanarium. After the stop before the aquarium we decided to go downstairs to prepare for our stop as;

A) the bus didn’t stop at all stops,
B) it was starting to rain
C) it was very difficult to understand where stops were.

My husband went to get up. Luckily, and oh my how thankful I am, my husband made moves to get up quite slowly, (rather than a jump straight up) he then ducked down very quickly. Therefore missing his head colliding with the bridge we had just started to go under. This bridge was not far taller than the bus - my husband is 6ft 2 and had he stood up just a little more, with being taller than the bus/bus ceiling, he would have hit the bridge. I cannot tell you how close this was/and how sick I still feel.

I wrote to the company and got a very unsympathetic response (screen shots added) .. apparantly because they had ‘a recording warning of bridge’ that it’s ok.

A) I, nor my husband remember reading the warning on the chair - that said, when it rains in Lisbon … it really rains. You have to sit in the rain with no umbrella waiting for the next stop? Not going to happen.

B) We, and I guess a lot of people didn’t hear the initial warning. The recording is not easy listening - the constant music is awful and there are very long periods of music so we turned it off, didn’t pay attention.

C) Therefore, didn’t listen to the warning about the bridge
I’m also wondering how someone who has difficulty hearing would have a chance to hear this.

Should my husband had not got up slowly, things would have been so different. When I say it was millimetres away from missing the bridge I am really not exaggerating.

I hope yellow bus tours review this route and make safety amendments before one of their passengers gets seriously hurt, or worse. Sadly, I don’t feel that they care.

Please use this bus tour with caution.",1
Don’t lose your paper ticket!,"Bought a 72 hour ticket & lost the paper ticket & then was told there wasn’t anything the company could do to re-issue our tickets. We had only used it for 24 hours, total waste of 180 euros. Don’t recommend, very poor customer service. Surely we are not the only people to accidentally lose tickets. We had a booking ref, confirmation email surely in this modern world the QR code would suffice.",1
Yellow bus tour not worth the money,"We paid over €200 for bus tour tickets + Aquarium for 4 adults and one child.
Aquarium experience was good.
The tour was not worth the time or money!!! The information given was minimal, there was a lot of background music instead of guided commentary that we paid for. Audio did not work on some seats. Tickets can be used on trams and buses too but we had no idea where to find them! Leaflet provided should have that information made clear for those who visit the city for the first time. I would not recommend Yellow bus tour.",2
Give it a miss,This was not so good. You cannot get down anywhere. By the time you try to click photos it moves on. So should give it a miss.,2
Terrible driver would not allow us to board with app ticket rather than paper one! He called police cos took his photo!,"We bought the tickets on the app and then boarded the bus. We were then given a printed ticket. The next time we got on the bus we did not have the printed tickets as we had changed our clothes back at the hotel & left the tickets there as we knew we had them in the app. However when we tried to board the bus the 2nd time we showed him the tickets on the app but the driver was very insistent and in a very unfriendly manner that we needed the paper version of the tickets to ride on his bus! We discussed this in a reasonable manner and got off the bus but he became very hostile when I took his photo . He got out of his seat and got off the bus and then would not let us walk away by blocking my husband physically and calling the police!!! We were not even on the bus. We wanted to go back to our hotel nearby to get the paper tickets!
His issue was that we took a photo of him!!
The police arrived very quickly as they were nearby and we explained the situation to them. They realised it was totally ridiculous but were not able to comment on the issue wit the paper v app ticket. They did request that we deleted the photo as it is illegal to take a photo of someone in Portugal without their consent. Good luck with that in the world of social media! So we deleted the photos & a video I front of the police and went on our way. We can of course recover the photo and video from our phones and will be very happy to share with you so you can see which of your drivers is giving yellow bus tours a very bad impression. We find it strange that he was so angry about the photo.. he must have something to hide?
All of that said… this issue only arose in he first place because your system is antiquated. Why have an app if the tickets on it are invalid.",1
Terrible waste of time!,"Terrible waste of time! We saw and learned more on our own walking around the city. Very few sights, minimal commentary and very repetitive when combined with Belem tour. Most of the time was spent on highway and looping out of town towards the airport. We’ve done the RED BUS Tours all over Europe in the past and we were very disappointed and will not ever go back to yellow bus!",1
Get out!!,"I took the 4:00 tour and 5 minutes into the tour, there was a blocage on the road. I was told it might be long and I should get out of the tram. I was not offered an alternative arrangement. My flight was the next day so I couldn't catch a different tour. I contacted the company to have a refund and I received a vague email that they were looking into the situation. A week later, I sent a second email and still have no response or refund.",1
Yellow boat tour - really not worth it,Music onboard way to loud - and commentary way to basic - and out of sync with monuments/sights. Also not really a hop on off experience as time between boats is 4 hours,2
Consider other traffic arrangements,"Stuck in traffic in morning Lisbon jam, took 2 hours to get to Belem from cruise ship terminal.And got poor attitude from staff at #1 stop. As tourists we have no idea how the route run and asking questions are quite normal. Highly not recommended.Yellow line staffs are more friendly.",1
Too much traffic,"Catastrophic traffic density hardly any progress Once out it is very bad to get back on a bus
Overall no recommendation",1
Scams and theft by Viator!,"Poor description on the website, difficult communication with the seller, the drivers only speak Portuguese (you would think that if they work with tourists, that they also speak another language).
There was promised audio guide in Dutch, but it was not there! We could just as easily drive a taxi around the city if there was no audio guide available, it was even cheaper.
The seller refuses to refund even part of the ticket.
Very disappointing all of them.",1
Avoid it as it fails on all counts,"We signed up based on the promise of being able to access lots of other attractions but rapidly discovered that the options were not available. Queued for 30 minutes for the elevator only to find that yellow bus pass was not acceptable and had to pay extra fees. Bus tours were average with lots of repetitive “lift music” and very limited speech about local sights. We then waited for the “free” tram ride only to discover that you could only use the bus ticket from one location. After walking to the one location the driver told us rudely that the tram was not running and then just ignored us and left us at the roadside. All round poor service and contact with the company was exceptionally bad, which is sad as these tours are often our favourites!",2
Very bad see obeb,"At the modern drive the driver has not approached the stop 8 and 9 a bigger fuck
I feel betrayed and betrayed",1
Bad company,"The yellow staff are poorly educated, lack patience with tourists (especially the elderly) and ironic. I didn't like the competing company a thousand times. Information between employees are not the same seems different companies",1
Not quite the ride I was waiting,The button to tell the driver you wanted to get off did not work. A couple traveling near me rode 3 Km before they figured out,1
BUYERS BE AWARE! TERRIBLE,"***BUYERS BE AWARE*** DON'T GET SCAMMED LIKE WE DID. We arrived at the cruise port in Lisbon and a very friendly lady at the desk told us to get these very specific tickets, she said it was the only ones available. We didn't know that she had sold us 2 days tickets, knowing full well that our Disney cruise was only going to be there for the day, in addition she charged us for 3 adults, even though they have teenage pricing and our son is only 15.
In addition, the routes they have are long and tedious, you waste so much time and it isn't worth it at all, as the city center is just walking distance and is a beautiful walk and area. Don't waste your money using this bus service.",1
Disappointing experience,"Several stops were suspended due to events, which was unfair to customers. The bus services were not frequent enough and live schedules were unreliable. A driver did not stop to let us get on. We had to walk back as it was the last service. He should be more considerate of customers.",2
Tickets not valid,"Booked tickets to Benfica stadium.
Couldn’t get in as staff at stadium said tickets were not valid.
Very very embarrassing and two very upset children.
Paid for a family ticket.
Do not waste your money.",1
DISAPPOINTMENT 😞,"I don't recommend it works terrible schedules incomprehensible, also sell you that everything comes in and then you go with the schedules like a locomotive running to all places condition the whole stay better transport card and valid tickets and you are free of schedules",1
Boat trip on Sundays simply cancelled.,"In itself good ticket with many usage possibilities (Hop in Hop Off, Trams, Furniculars) and actually boat trip!! Actually. We booked the ticket on Fridays for 72 hours. On Saturdays we still checked at the counter due to bad weather due to the boat's departure times. Sunday we come to the branch where the lady of the counter informs us that the winter travel times have been in force since Sunday morning and there would be no boat tour on Sunday. Alternatively, she can only offer to extend the ticket by 24 hours. Useless for us, as we leave the next day. That's just cheeky and it's not possible. It is probably absolutely unnecessary to deal with customers in this way. Timetable changes, especially for winter, are predictable and can be issued early. Absolute cheekiness.",2
Appalling company which should be avoided!,"Purchased 2 tickets on arrival at Lisbon cruise terminal, valid for 2 days. Seemed like a good deal and everything went fine on day 1. However, on day 2 we went to the terminal to find the yellow bus counter was unmanned, nobody from yellow bus to be found. We went outside to the bus stops and NO yellow bus vehicles in sight! Only the red buses of a rival company who were present on both days.
Extremely disappointed and annoyed at the appalling service offered by this company.
As it happened we were kindly given 2 unwanted tickets for the red buses which saved the day.
I would strongly advise any travellers to avoid this terrible company which mis-sold us a 2 day ticket which they failed to honour. Book the red bus instead!!!",1
Oh that's long,"Just off a cruise ship today and needed a tour of Lisbon as it's very hilly, did a fantastic tuk tuk one last time so decided on the yellow bus this time. Well got on about 9.30 and headed off on the red route thru modern Lisbon, absolute rubbish all concrete but never mind as it progressed things got better and we arrived at a nice square where we got off and bought a few souvenirs and looked round a market. Then it all went wrong got on the next bus and it then continues to the BLUE route thru old Lisbon lovely, and on and on further and further out towards the maritime museum U could see Christ the Redeemer over the other side and we got worried it's now nearly 1300, 1pm and the ship leaves at 1500 3pm. So as panic set in that we might not make it back and getting hungry and needing the loo, we got off and caught a taxi back, not bad under €20. Phew time for lunch on board just before 1400 . 2pm please Check lengths of trip before U buy.",2
Choose another bus,"Buses pass a lot in the morning, but in the afternoon around 3pm, we waited 1h20 before changing our mind and taking a taxi. We called the company, but we were put on hold for more than 10 minutes. Very bad experience, we were more than 15 people waiting for this bus in the sun.",2
No Aerobus seen,"For a city trip we wanted to go from the airport to the city center by Aerobus. Outside the arrival hall we soon found the Aerobus stop. The information poster indicated that there are two lines and that only line 1 would run. According to the information, the bus would run every 20 minutes. There is no interactive information, on which you can see how long it will take (like in the subway). We waited for more than half an hour, but did not see an Aerobus. Also during our stay in Lisbon we did not see an Aerobus running. Our tip is to Trips by Metro: cheap, relatively quick and clear.",1
Pro driver.,"The general's all right. The problem was a driver who in the beginning on our second day. He begins to tell us that we (without the slightest idea) get off without pressing the stop button. Being that we know how this system works since I work in tourism in Portugal and I am a Tourism Guide.
Better instruct drivers to talk to accurate information. Don't make things up!!!! It ruined my start of the day in Lisbon with my family coming from sight!",1
"Shame the Driver, Not Pro","Overall well, the hearing aids are good and so are the explanations. What is noteworthy is that the driver who touched us on Wednesday, October 16 at 9:00 was totally disrespectful, got confused in person and started challenging us... totally inappropriate, should be talked to with the customer, ruined our day",2
Save your money,Didn’t get a lot of history. Played more music over headphones. Also bus felt very dirty. Good thing it was inexpensive.,2
2nd day no staff or busses at cruise terminal,We chose yellow over red company but sorry. We were in Port two days and bought 2 day ticket. But we We came to counter in Port terminal the second day there was no one at yellow bus counter and no yellow bus. The red and green lines were there. Only op t ion was to walk to the Rosario square 30 minutes up hill. I applied for refund and hope they respond. For now best to choose red line if at cruiseport in lisbon,1
Too long boring,Waiting time too long and some routes specifically purple is too boring highly not recommended they could make routes more interesting,2
Don’t buy. Horrible,Worst ever. Buses weren’t running. App didn’t work. Drivers rude. Not one thing good to say about this experience. Don’t know what else to say.,1
Very poor,"Very poor. You can’t get on and off at the same stop without getting off at the terminus and waiting for the next bus. One day we waited 45 mins. Staff lied- said the bus would arrive in 10 mins, after 15 mins then said another 10 mins. When you complain they just say it’s not their fault. The red busses looked to be better organised.",1
In need of Maintanance!,"I gave my elderly parents two tickets as a gift for the their first-time trip to Lisbon. My own memory of Tram 28 is wonderful. Sadly, this was not the case for them. Multiple ports for the audio did not work, and they were unable to listen to the commentary during the tour. Instead, the guide / driver tried to shout from the front what to look out for when they complained about the audio ports being defective, but obviously this is not ideal, and they were unable to hear him. For the price of this offer, this felt like being ripped off. Let's maintain the tram so that everyone can benefit from this premium service?",2
Poor experience,"Very disorganised, awful service, impolite staff that do not accept constructive feedback.
Tour taken the 21st of September from the main point.",1
Not worth the hype.,Awful audio quality. Couldn’t understand a word. No historical overview. Just music 90% of the time. Waste of money and time.,1
Unhappy and disappointed when doing the river cruise due to tour guide and sales girl,"We bought a 48 hour ticket for the yellow bus and boat cruise. The bus was very nice and far more informative than the #Grayline in Porto. When we went on the cruise we were standing in the hot sun queueing for about 40 minutes before they allowed people to board. By this time there was a very long queue. About 15 minutes before boarding a tour arrived and when boarding started they said we should wait for the tour to board first. There is no signage saying that so I told them “NO!!!” Or refund my money now!! The tour guide had me by the arm pushing me until I told him not to touch me. (I am a woman in my late sixties) and this is the respect he showed. Everyone in the queue was very angry and the man in front of me in the queue said as a senior, he will not give way for this young tour. So much unhappiness to the extent that it seemed a fight would breakout. The captain then told the tour guide everyone should board at the same time.",2
AWFUL,"This was the worst hop on hop off bus I have ever been on. I had a ticket for 2 days and went on the first leg but never went on again because the quality was so poor. The sound quality was bad and was not synced to what I was seeing. The narration was so poor, I learned nothing about the city. I asked for a refund but was denied.",1
It was a bad experience.,"They sold me a schedule that was no longer active in Belem station and I was waiting more than an hour and a half for the boat to arrive, I could not take it another time because that day I bought the ticket I was going to Madrid,
I've sent a lot of emails to get my ticket refunded and they won't respond.
People who sell the service are not well trained to give the reports.",1
Boat tour with two classes of guests,"The bus tour was as expected. But: During the boat tour we queued with many others about 20 minutes in the sun. Shortly before the start of the tour, a tour group was led past us onto the boat. Only then was everyone else allowed on board. The tour group of course took the best places. As a family we are regularly on Trips But that was by far the greatest injustice we have ever experienced. The displeasure of the other participants was also obvious. Yellow Bus Tours, come up with something.",2
Avoid at all costs. A huge waste of time.,"One of, if not THE worst tour of my life. We took the blue line from the cruise port to meet up to the smaller green line. It was over an hour of wasted time. The blue line seems purposely designed to take you everywhere in Lisbon that you never wanted to see: industrial areas, abandoned, ruined buildings, soulless, newly built suburbs, a freeway, and you nearly make it to the airport before finally reaching the historical center.

Oh, and it took nearly an hour to finally depart as the driver was doubling as the ticket seller and each transaction took forever. He did finally drive off but pulled over again to argue with someone on his cell phone about the receipts, until enough of us complained and we eventually got underway.

If we had known what awaited us, we’d have been in no hurry.

Save your money, and more importantly your time, and get a tuk tuk or find literally any other means to explore Lisbon.

This is NOT the way to go.",1
Don’t expect to learn much on this tour,"The audio portion of this tour was extremely short. There was so much time to tell about buildings, neighborhoods, tourist, sites, history! Anything that would be interesting to someone in their first time here in Lisbon.

99% of the time you got to hear Portuguese music, drowning on interrupted only a handful of times with some history about what you are seeing on the tour

We’ve done many hop on hop off tours, and most of them are very enlightening, educational, and interesting.

This was anything but the above",2
Departure to laa 18:00 and NO BOAT LEAVES,"We waited almost an hour to ride it on the boat and at the end because it occurred to us to ask a boy and it turns out that at six in the afternoon none have changed the time without warning canceling six in the afternoon

SHAMEFUL",1
These tours are terrible.,The tour audio guide is so boring 3/4 of the guide is Portuguese music and you can't adjust the volume or at least it doesn't say.It was the worst audio guide I listened to.,1
Don’t waste your money! No service to clients!,"A hundred percent would not recommend! Ours broke down 10 minutes in the tour, and we got left in very hot temperatures with direct sun for about 1 hour, everyone left. We emailed yellow bus tours and never got a response for a refound. Do better yellow bus tours!",1
Rubbish service,Absolute rubbish - DO NOT USE. get local rebus tour.been waiting half an hour- no bus and no replyfrom tour operator. PHONE LINES DONT CONNECT.,1
Bad,"Unfortunately, communication is very poor.
Buses don't come Trams sometimes don't run at all
Employee promises money back but is just a promise",1
Stick to the Blue Route,The Belem tour of the historic city was very interesting. The tour of modern Lisbon was the dullest bus tour I’ve ever done. Give it a miss! Also be prepared for non-stop awful music which really detracts from the experience. Why is there no option to hear the narrator only?,2
Don't do it,"I wouldn't recommend it at all. Everything on the bus was broken, this was due to the warm weather, the employee at the starting point said. She said we could get the price of the ticket back. To date, I have never received a response to my many emails.",1
"Disappointed, honestly not worth it","Honestly, we expected better
Nothing special
We were sold the super tours
And nothing magical
I do not recommend this outing, there are other things to do
Disappointed",2
Hop on Tour Incomplete,"We were told the Tram tour for June 12 was cancelled due to a festival. That tour should have been blocked during our booking. We were not able to make up for the list opportunity fue to other tours we booked. We have reached out to Yellow Bus Tours for a ticket extension but nothing has been heard from them. We are requesting your intervention to get a ticket extension for today,June 16. We are leaving Portugal early tomorrow morning. If not we are requesting a refund for the Tram tour leg of our booking.",1
Be prepared for long waits,"Unfortunately not so happy with Yellow Bus in Lisbon for these reasons :
1. Long waits between buses, waited up to one hour. Did not take the chance of getting off. Missed a realtime online schedule.
2. Information on guide was limited. Long intermissions with after a while annoying Fado music ( I would prefer less music and more information and maybe a couple fun stories) I am sure there are so much more to tell about this city.
3. For boat tour, they had us waiting out in burning sun and 30 degrees for 30 minutes before letting us on the boat. Recommend to set up shades in summertime . The information on boat was very brief and in too many languages.

Good thing with the tour is that you get an ok overview of the city.",2
Packed tram,Yellow historic tram. We were told in brochure only pickup was Rossi square waited an hour at Rossi square only to find it also picked up locals and tourists along the route . Soon our tram was heaving and I was giving up my seat for woman with a baby ...,2
Not a good idea to take this tour in summer as you will roast. Poor quality audio. No accommodations for woman traveling,"So much to complain about. I was alone with my daughter and twice we had to run a bus down that should have seen us trying to make it. Although my daughter had a paid ticket she had to sit on my lap because of the overcrowding. Advertised as having free WiFi and AC, did not have either. Audio did not work so I didn’t know anything about where we were. Driver did not announce stops so us and other passengers were lost as to where and when to get off. Feel like I got gypped since I paid for 2 tickets but never got two persons worth of service. I was in hijab and felt ignored and discriminated against when I asked any questions since the entire experience was so confusing.",1
Never again! Total scam,"This tour company is a complete rip off. 1 tour was ok. 1 tour was mostly the same as the first and showing you where the malls are. Finally the tram tour, we could not get on as the lines were too long. Too many tickets sold. This was a total scam and rip off. Never again booking with this company. They should be ashamed to take money for what they are giving people.",1
Don‘t recommend !!,"The overall experience was just about okish. We tried to get on the bus at the tile museum but the bus driver just ignored us and we ended up wasting 40 minutes waiting for the next one to come which was very ANNOYING! Yellow bus tour also needs to be more clear about the discounts you get at museums as we found out you don’t get a discount on your ticket at the tile museum. The gentleman at the tile museum literally told us that ‚they lie‘ about the discounts and that he’s only aware of discounts on tickets for the aquarium. After that experience we were nervous about using our ticket for the tram but luckily it worked!

We also felt that there was too much music and not enough commentary! We purchased the 48 hour bus ticket which was 28 Euros per person which is quite steep based off the experience you actually get! You’re better off just walking around Lisbon, doing your research online beforehand and taking the tram occasionally!",2
Bad experience,"Our bus crush with a cat, they bring us to the next bus, without any care or medical atention, some people have some punches, like me in my Leg, my wife in arm. Not any consideration or asking if we need something. Very nad experience",2
Boring and overpriced - I learnt basically nothing,"Lisbon is a beautiful city and the tour had some lovely views. However, the commentary was sparse and dull. It was 90% music with very little information. €22 felt very expensive for this tour. It was so boring we got off halfway round and got a tram back into town because we couldn't be bothered getting back on. I'm a tour guide and I wanted to learn about Portugal and Lisbon - I felt like I learnt almost nothing after being on this bus for an hour with perhaps 10 minutes total commentary. Boring, overpriced, and the traffic is terrible (which isn't their fault but means you spend ages sitting in traffic while music plays with almost no commentary at all). It was very disappointing.",2
Modern tour - not worth seeing,"Unfortunately, the tour isn't particularly exciting. We decided to join spontaneously and didn't check the route beforehand. I think the Belém tour is interesting, but the modern tour isn't at all! You'll also be going to Nirvana, so it's not really a good idea to get off...",1
Not the yellow buses,"Be careful there are 2 companies, yellow or red buses. You have to take the red buses, many more buses, availability and therefore much less waiting. The routes are identical.",2
Lack of respect for tourists.,"We waited more than an hour for the bus to pass, we arrived at 1500h, near the navy museum and the bus only arrived at 16:00h, everything leads us to believe that it was on purpose to arrive close to 19:00h and not have to do another trip, the red buses pass at least three times.",2
"No Buses, though Tram Great","The tram part of the Lisbon Hop-On Hop-Off Tour was great. The guide was very knowledgeable and personable. We would definitely recommend this part of the tour. The following day we went to the bus stop and waited for an hour. The bus never came, so we started to walk various places. After a while we waited at another stop, but the bus never came. In fact, the entire day we never saw a yellow bus to get on. What a waste of time and money. We finally ended up buying a Grayline hop-on hop-off pass for the rest of the day, which worked well.",2
Lisbon Red route on the Hop on Hop off bus,"The Red Bus and Red Route - avoid !!
No working ear phones make this a complete disaster- They say available every 30mins - lie !!
The Grey line was the one we should have booked",1
Nice trip but with problems! Yellow bus LIS,"Nice tour and good information about the sights. Maybe there could be a little more informations about what you can see on the route in Lisboa.
We had two 48h ticket (76€) yellow bus + tram and got it printed at our first bus trip. Sadly we lost the print for the second day. We had the online booking confirmation, payment and the voucher but we’re not allowed
to get into the bus again without the print. Us was told that we can get a discount for a new one. Also there was no reaction to our support e-mail. There was only a Portuguese telephone number… no chance to get help.
That‘s a very bad way to handle customers!",2
BIG Disappointment,"Big Disappointment. Traveling with family 7 people (total 2 are 78 yrs old. ) As recommended by travel agent we went on Monday. We started at 9 am and were off on last bus run. Most Museums were closed which we found out when we disembarked. When asking drivers for information all 3buses we used were very abrupt. We were told came every 30 minutes it was more 45 to 1 hour no shade or benches available to wait…,,5 bussed were shown on the live route app. App says 3 minutes away and never shows. When got the buses they are over crowded had to sit lower level no ac or open windows for air circulation. Tried taking yellow boat which is extra and due to lack of busses missed the delay and had 2 1/2 h wait. Then missed bus’s for next stop had hour wait Very uncomfortable especially for older adults after standing in sun for 45 min to hour. Never got to use modern Lisbon route as bus never came. After 1hour wait we took last Belem bus so we could at least get nearer to our hotel. Wasted most of day waiting for the bus. Not a true hop on off ride. Better pay little more and have tour where you can get off and on",2
Crap Hop-on Hop-off company,"This is the worst hop-on, hop-off company I ever travelled with. We had a 3-day pass code on my phone, plus a printed copy. The initial bus driver scanned the code on my phone and issued us one flimsy receipt. At no point did he say it was the ONLY way you are then able to travel for the duration. If you lose or damage your flimsy paper receipt, where the QR code won't scan, there is absolutely no contingency plan and the driver will not accept your 3 day phone/printed pass. Basically, we spent over 80 euros to take one trip on a yellow bus, got our ticket soaking wet in the TORRENTS that happened that first morning (27th March 2024) and that was the end of our free trams, river cruise, elevator ticket, and discounts to various places. It was a complete rip-off, with NO after sales service or flexibility. NEVER use this company - there are plenty of others in Lisbon!",1
Already before noon Unreliable and totally overcrowded,"It would have been nice if the buses hadn't been hopelessly overcrowded by midday. This meant that the timetable could no longer be kept. Instead of the promised 20 minutes, I had to wait over 45 minutes for the next bus, only to then not be able to get on. I just continued on foot, which was a shame.",2
Average,"The weather was terrible, so the impressions of the trip were not very good. I was surprised by the skill of the drivers, who masterfully taxied in the narrow streets, plus the heavy traffic. If you get good weather, you can go. But in comparison with other European cities, a trip to Lisbon loses in its organization.",2
I do not recommend this excursion!,"The excursion is about nothing, the route is nothing, the guide's story is just empty. At the stops you have to wait for the bus for an hour, the online map does not work. In response to our complaints in the chat, they couldn’t really say anything. We planned visits to interesting places in Lisbon, because of this excursion We didn’t have time to get anywhere!! Maybe the red buses will be ok, but I don’t recommend the yellow ones 100%!!",1
We could not use it due to yellow bus delay.,"We went to Lisbon to travel as a family. We made a reservation for the Yellow bus. We did not use it because the train was delayed on the tour we purchased. We informed the officer that the time of our flight was not certain and that sometimes there were delays and that we had the right to cancel and sent an e-mail. We wrote many times, just asking for the ticket and getting a call. They didn't even respond yet and we were left feeling victimized.",1
Not very tourist-friendly,"The tour itself was nice but they were not very informative about their bus schedules. The driver dropped us off in the middle of nowhere at the end of the Belem tour without any English explanation, and the bus schedule did not accord with the live schedule, so we ended up not being able to take on the Modern tour, wasting a lot of time and money. I emailed the customer center for a partial refund but got no response, as expected.",2
Long and boring. Just get a tram ticket.,Red line bus was ok and took around 50 minutes. The blue line tour took almost 2 hours and you mainly see high rise apartment blocks until you get to Belem. Don't bother at all. Long and boring. The tram part you are told that you have to embark at a certain point and that you can't get off once on. So not true. So my advice is to just buy a tram ticket and you can hop on hop off the 28 and 12 tram as often as you want. Fantastic.,2
Disappointing experience,We expected more from the 48-hours tickets. On our way back from Belem tower the bus drove away 10 minutes before the time mentioned in the live-app. Afterwards the app didn't work anymore and we took a regular tram (30 minutes walk). The next day we tried to hop on the Red Tram but the driver didn't open the doors and just drove away. Some other tourists had the same experience. The last ram at 17:00 hours is to early if you want to take full advantage of the tickets.,2
Disappointing bus tour,"Whenever I visit a new city I take the local Red bus tour as an introduction to the city The narration on the Lisbon city tour was abysmal. We passed by so many interesting looking places but heard nothing but music on our earphones.
So disappointed.",2
Bus driver ignore people at bus stop!,"Staff service is not good. 1) We waited more than 25 mins at the bus stop and the bus driver drove past us. Luckily he had to stop at the red light and we caught up to him. When we asked him why he didn't stop for us, he scoffed that we had to raise our hand to signal him to stop. Hmm, we standing there with eye contact to the driver and steps moving towards the approaching bus is not a good enough signal for him to stop? 2) The staff who issued us the ticket at Station Martim Moniz was not friendly either. She did not bother giving enough direction and map and did not help organize people standing in line for the bus where some people took advantage of cutting in front when the bus arrived. Overall the staff don't seem to be happy with their jobs.",2
"Terrible service, little tourist interest, poor quality/price ratio","Terrible service, the headset didn't work, the staff ignored the problem, so I had to share it with my partner. The information given is minimal, most of it is played with Portuguese music, the route is of little interest, only the Belem area is spared. In short, it was two hours of boredom on large avenues full of traffic lights. I don't recommend it to anyone.",1
Worst experience in Lisbon!,This was the worst experience I ever had. Overpriced and a real waste of time. AVOID! We were going up and down in the same areas.,1
Pathetically boring commentary,"Only do this for a convenient, overview tour of the city. Do not expect an informatory commentary as it is extremely weak. There's over an hour of information that the recorded guide could provide but it doesn't instead, a few bits of information here and there. Some of the commentary wasn't even informative but rather common sense like ""stop by one of the many cafes throughout the city when thirsty or hungry."" Duh...

Also, the company should have a more sustainable option for the headphones rather than having customers just dispose of them. If you do go on this tour, please don't forget to throw away the little plastic bags of the headphones! I saw so many on the floor and getting blown away as litter...",2
Boring and lazy commentary….,"Worst bus tour we’ve experienced. Purchased a 48 hr pass on the Yellowbus as we were in Lisbon for 3 nights travelling from Ireland. We did one of the routes on the first day and on the last stop, after an extremely dull commentary (via personal headphones), we got off the bus near the castle with all the other passengers. None of the commentary gave us information as to what to do when we got off so, like most of the other passengers, we got back on the bus and headed back to the city centre. Boring!

The second day was exactly the same and we headed towards the Aquarium - a rather bleak, dull drive from the city centre. It was the same commentary as the previous day - boring, uninspired, uninformative and lazy. Aquarium was quite good but expensive at €25 per head. We turned off the commentary on the second bus route because it was so repetitive.",2
Hop On Hop Off Bus - Blue Route Lisbon,"We usually love the hop on hop off buses & think they are usually great value for money but today we did the blue route around Lisbon & it was two boring hours of not much to see of any real interest. ( Only 4 photos taken which says it all! )
We were very disappointed that this was a route chosen to represent Lisbon as our friends took a tut tut around the old part near the shops & cafes & said Lisbon was beautiful.",2
Not really worthy,"Only two buses served the two lines that the yellow bus offers and they were always almost full (especially the blue route) therefore not really a lot of opportunities to jump on and off as there was a lot of waiting time in between…
Not really worthy, compared to other options - the red busses for example which were many more serving their routes.
The benefits were that the 48-hours ticket offered a free ride on 28 tram and the yellow old trams.",2
Waste of time and money,"Completely unreliable. Wasted a lot of time waiting for busses. Obviously they skipped some. Used the bus 3 times, twice I had to wait for more than 30 minutes.
Bus was overcrowded, stood downstairs.
21 Euros for 24-hour ticket is ridiculous.",1
Could not even get on the bus! Don't believe Rick Steeves' recommendation,"The buses were so overcrowded and late. We waited for 3 buses (well over an hour) before walking back down the garden and taking the Grey Line (doubling our cost) which had lots of buses and more routes. Don't believe when buying online that there are limited numbers sold to prevent this. We heard from others waiting that the reason they took this company is that Rick Steeves recommended it. Maybe he is getting a piece of the action. Thanks to Grey Line, we salvaged the days.",1
Don't bother,"Not very well signposted to where you have to buy your tickets, eventually we found a long queue and a lady selling tickets, she said the next bus would be the one for Belem, we waited a good 40 mins and when the bus came it was carnage, people who don't know how to queue were pushing to the front, the queue was so long we didn't get on the first bus. The lady selling tickets said ths next one would be another 25 mins, by this time we were losing the will to live. However another one turned up within 15 mins we boarded and sat upstairs, commentary was patchy interspersed with music. It wasn't clear when you were approaching a stop so you could easily miss it. The return journey was horrendous, it was pouring with rain and when we got on it was standing room only, the driver then proceeds to let more people on at the next stop, clearly no room we were packed in like sardines, not helped by some ignorant Germans who barged one through the exit doors making it more packed and dangerous. These tours need some health and safety regulations, if the bus had crashed it would have been carnage, more buses need putting onto the routes as you wait ages. Don't bother paying for this you might as well use the public bus or tram system which would probably be safer!!!!",2
Disappointing tour 😕,"Worst city bus tour I've been on. 2 sides of city very boring and not worth spending 1.5 hrs each day on bus. Trams are better or tuk tuks.
Very disappointed.",2
"Queues, crowds and tram out of service","Very bad service. Queues, buses always full on the upper floor, etc. In addition, we took the combined bus&tram ticket to take the tram tour with our 4-year-old son. But the tram service was not working. I have sent an email to get the money back for the tram tour and I am still waiting for a response.",1
BOAT CANCELLED WITH NO NOTICE,"The boat trip from Lisbon to Belem on Saturday was nice enough but the reason we picked a hop on, hop off was so we could spend time in Belem and come back to Lisbon later. When we disembarked at Belem nobody bothered to tell us that the next - and last of the day - boat had been cancelled. So, when we were ready to return we stood around for ages wondering why it was late, only to find out from someone who didn’t even work for the company that they’d cancelled it, We then had to pay for a taxi to bring us back to Lisbon. As there we’re 3 of us I paid €66 for what was basically a one-way boat ride to Belem, and had the expense of a taxi home afterwards. I’ve emailed the company to ask for a partial refund and had zero response so far. Pretty shocking customer service. If you’re thinking of doing this trip, make sure you double check that the boat you want to return on is actually running.",1
Not so good,"We took a a non stop ride and TWICE the trolley got stuck because of cars blocking the path. The first time we were delayed for maybe one hour. The second time, we just gave up and walked. They have no system in place to come and tow the cars. This happened twice on one ride. That was a wasted $50. I have to say, everything in Lisbon is inefficient. Just saying. Lots of wasted time.",2
Not recommendable,"Completely overcrowded buses and unfriendly bus drivers. Some passengers stood on the stairs to the open part of the bus during the journey. Far too few stops on the return journey.
Tram tour did not take place due to technical defects. No information at the stop and the update on the website was far too late. Catastrophic service.",2
Yellow bus sells tickets for routes that they aren't operating.,"Sold us a ticket for 2 bus routes and boat route. 1 route was shut down, the other was skipping half the route. The boat kicked us off because crew were going on a 2hr lunch and left no where close to a bus route. Had to get taxi to get home.

Tried second day and driver sent us up top where there were no seats. By the time we got back down he had people standing in the aisle. No way to hear the tour without a seat. When questioned, driver suggested getting off...next bus wasn't for another hour and no guarantee it would have seats.

Asked for money back but no response.

AVOID YELLOW BUS.",1
Hop on and don’t get off because I probably won’t be a seat when you come back,"We bought the ticket and then had to stand and wait for an hour and 15 minutes on the hot sun because they didn’t have enough buses. Was total chaos when they a bus would come in. It would take them 15 minutes to load a bus for 65 people totally unacceptable. They didn’t have a capacity to load more than one bus at a time. Even if multiple buses were there they would only load one…. complete chaos. We should’ve been told upfront, and we are going to stand there for well over an hour in the hot sun, but no one mentioned that when they sold us a ticket.",1
Bad experience with Yellow Bus in Portugal,"The time frames for intervals between bird is supposed to be 20 minutes. We routinely experienced waits over an hour long. Their app showing where the buses are currently and when they should arrive at your stop were wrong most of the time. The worst issue is that they don’t announce the upcoming stop and if no one on the bus has pressed the stop button, they do not stop! So if you are waiting to be picked up at a stop where no one on the bus has pressed stop, they will drive right past you. Lastly, the lower enclosed portion of the bus is not air conditioned or even has fans. It gets extremely hot on these buses. We noticed the the Red line buses ran much more frequently and kept to their advertised schedules. We are trying cancel our remaining Yellow bus tickets in Seville, Madrid and Barcelona. Really has been the worst part of our trip.",1
Very poorly organized,"We waited for the bus for more than an hour with at least 70 other passengers. In between, one of them let the passengers get off and then drove backwards to a parking lot where he was parked. It was 36 degrees in Lisbon that day and there was no shade at the stop. When a bus finally arrived, there was almost a fight when getting on. Many people then stood in the bus and were not given any explanations.
We would not choose yellow bus again",1
Disappointing,We have gone on many hop on hop off tours. This was the worst we have been on. The driver was very nice but it was an extremely hot day and the air conditioning in the bus was not sufficient to make us comfortable. Needless to say it made the tour excruciating. Also the audio tour explanation was ok but the music at the pauses was extremely annoying.,2
SHAMBLES!!! BUS DIDN’T EVEN ARRIVE…TWICE,"We opted for the Modern Lisbon Line as we had read online that 2 stops were unavailable on the Blue line due to a public event. We arrived and purchased tickets at a kiosk close by, then headed to the bus stop to get the 10am bus. On arrival at the bus stop, there was a crowd of people with no organisation. Just a large group gathered for both routes that depart from the same stop. After waiting for around half an hour with no sign of the bus we needed (plenty for the other tour but we were not allowed to get on this one instead), we decided to go and explore nearby stalls and return for the next bus which was due at 11am rather than stand in the direct sun. On our return there was still no real organisation, and the same people were still waiting for a purple line bus so we knew we hadn’t missed it while we were away. After waiting more than half an hour, still with no bus for the tour we had purchased tickets for arriving, we asked one of the staff who said they would have phone management to find out what was happening. They said they had no idea and were wondering the same as the customers as to the whereabouts of the bus. We had wasted the morning by this point and weren’t keen to spend the rest of the day at bus stops waiting for buses that didn’t arrive! We asked how we could get a refund, being advised to return to the kiosk as our tickets had not yet been redeemed. The kiosk could not give a refund as we paid by card and we were told to email the company directly. We emailed yellowbus@carris.pt at that the time, providing the evidence of our purchase and explained our experience. Still waiting for a response despite chasing. It’s a bit of a stretch calling it a bus tour if there is no bus to get on! All in all, not a good experience and generally a waste of our time.",1
"Efficient, but boring.","Waste of time. We always use the Hop on Hop off bus tours, because of the information offered. These tours use a recorded message. Not all the ear plugs work and the plug-ins have different UI’s, making the usage vary from one seat to the next. Perhaps it was just Greyline. There are other Hop On Hop Off tour operators. However, the Yellow route was a reasonable way to get around the western side of the city.",2
Not a good experience,Unfortunately I would not recommend this tour bus as it was constantly full and we really did struggle to get a seat. Other people in the queue we also complaining and some people got off as it was standing room only. This is not the fault of the driver but the company should be putting on more buses.,1
Was left behind,"I ordered a 48 hour ticket for the New Lisbon and Belem tour for 27 euros. On the first day, I took the last departure on the trip to New Lisbon. The live coverage of the bus route was fine and the trip was reasonably interesting. The next day I took the trip to Belem, and since I chose the 4pm departure, I also wanted to use the hop-off/hop-on option.
At the stop under the bridge ""Ponte 25 de Abril"" at 4:50 p.m. I went for a walk in the area, and returned to the same stop at 7:30 p.m
On the ""live coverage"" I could see that the bus was estimated to arrive at this stop at 7:45 p.m., but unfortunately it was informed on the screen that the live coverage was not working. I waited until 8:15 p.m. but no bus came!
As the Yellow Bus Tours page it is stated that the ticket also could be used for public trams, I therefore tried to use this option to come back, but was refused by the driver.",1
Waiting for final pay at the end of the afternoon,"The bus does not come or comes very late, sometimes you have to wait an hour.
And according to the track and trace it will arrive soon, but it won't be very disruptive",1
Chaos,Day one: arrived at starting point at Praca da Figueira to find a scene of chaos with huge queues with no indication of which line was for which route. The two staff members present seemed to be totally out of their depth and were less than helpful. Eventually got on a bus after an hour in the sun. Day two: got on a bus at an intermediate stop to find that there were no seats but incredibly at the next stop more people were allowed on. We got off at the next again stop and gave up on the tour.,2
A shame and scam of a tour.,"In the brochure it says a frequency of 25' and today we waited at the Jerónimos stop for 1:05'. The bus was full, all the people standing, a woman with a baby sitting on the step of the bus, the heat was unbearable. Nobody took responsibility. It is recommended not to use Yellow Bus",1
...not recommended!,"It's simply unbelievable, the bus drivers just drive past the stops. It's not possible to get on or off. The staff are not available to answer questions.",1
Don't go.,"This tour was horribly organized, one line for four or five different tours. People cut in line with no consequences. The employees gave erroneous information and did not monitor the crowd. There was no air conditioning on the bottom level. No one gave out earphones or a map. A waste of money. The thing I enjoyed most was getting off the bus. People were sitting on the floor and standing between the seats.",1
Very bad service,This was very disappointing. We managed to take just few stops. Buses were too crowded we had to stand all the time and there was no place to plug in the earphones so we missed everything. Busses were late also. It was disaster actually. Would never take this again. Total waste of money and time.,1
It was chaotic!!!,"Terrible! First I took an uber to the Praça da Figueira to wait for the first bus of the day and it only showed up an hour later after the time it was supposed to run, not only that, there were so many people wait for the bus already that I wasn’t able to go on board of the first one, my line was the blue one, and for 2 consecutive buses they showed up with the red line, so the line got super long again over 50 people waiting for the bus around 11am! We kept waiting for the bus and not be seen, the girls working there selling and scanning tickets said the traffic was really bad that day, she came to scan my ticket (before the bus was even there) which I regret doing that, cause I ended up having my voucher as redeemed, kept waiting til I changed my mind and took another Uber to the Torre Belém! I called requesting a refund cause I didn’t get to use the bus (even tho my ticket was scanned by the girl at the bus stop), and I’m still waiting to see if the refund is gonna happen, specially cause they may think I used the bus when in fact I did not and ended up spending over €50 euros on uber rides so my day wouldn’t be wasted! I was there on a cruise ship so I only had between 9am to 3pm to enjoy Lisbon, and the Yellow bus made me waste 3 hours of my time in Lisbon! Never again!",1
The experimente was middle,We hat a 48 hours ticket with bus and bost im Lissabon. The busses and the boat were ok. But the busses and the boat also were mostly too Fall and you have to weit for the next one or even staying in it without sound.,2
Not good at all.,"Booked this ticket on the spot at one of their tour kiosks, for that day. We set off and dropped off at the Gardens, for only 10 minutes. We were told that buses come every 30 minutes. We were left waiting for 3 hours. There were also other people with children, that were stranded. No shade on a hot day. We ended up getting an Uber to the places of our interest. Several Red buses came along, but no Red ones. There was no time during our trip to return to the Kiosk, to challenge them. It was completely a wasted time. We would like a refund as we did not do the tour. The picture attached is of some of the other people (strangers) who were waiting for the bus.",1
Yellow Bus Tours Lisbon is a scam - they take your money and don’t provide the tours you pay for,"DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS TOUR COMPANY
Paid A$141 for two 72 hour bus tickets plus tram tour and river cruise. Buses were advertised as running every 20 minutes. Tried to use the tickets on our first day in Lisbon and waited at the bus stop for 1 1/2 hours (with 16 other very angry people) but no bus ever turned up. Tried to ring the company but couldn’t get through on the phone so emailed them but they haven’t bothered to reply. They have not tried in any way to contact me to apologise or explain their failure to provide a service yesterday.YELLOW
Am reporting this company to the Portuguese Tourism Authority.",1
Terrible service and company yellow us,"Bus totally full, people standing up, zero safety! I told to the driver that it was not right and safety an he ignored saying the safety was outside the bus. The timing between points was also totally wrong taking much more time than expected. TERRIBLE COMPANY (plate attached)",1
Terrible frequency: one bus every hour. Not worth it!,"Busses are coming every hour on the hour.
The red busses are coming every 15 min. Don’t waste your money or time on the yellow busses.
The red busses have identical routes.",1
Disappointing and a waste of time.,"Such a waste of money, insufficient info and bad customer service. Communication was awful. They wouldn’t accept our booking which was made via Viator and trip advisor. Had to walk to kiosk mikes away to get a printed voucher for the bus. The staff were unhelpful/borderline rude. The bus trip itself was no comparison to others like it I’ve done. Not much info/faulty headphone’s. Biggest waste of money!",1
Boring - would not recommend,"Did the Belem Bus Tour with my partner and we were very unimpressed. Boring route with uninteresting stops/sights, not enough audio commentary and poor communication throughout. The staff selling the tickets we’re really lovely and helpful but overall the tour was boring. Would not recommend.",1
Red bus much better,"Looks like operating only few buses,always full of peoples,one bus didn't even stopped in one station even though could see few empty seats on top of the roof. Allowing standing peoples they obstruct the views",1
Disappointing,"First they don't comply with the schedule, the first day they had us waiting for an hour for the bus to come. And secondly, it is not normal that with three small children and I suffering from a back problem, we spend another hour waiting for the bus in the sun and in August, in front of us a couple enters the bus and they do not let us enter without any explanation.",2
A lot of money for little service,"A lot of money for very little. The bus routes are not very interesting, there are far too few buses, which means there are long lines everywhere and the aisles are full. Hop off is not possible, you will never get back in.
For the same money you can book a much nicer tuk tuk tour!",1
Late late late,"Don'Get it, it's always late and stops before 19 as scheduled. Very crowded it's difficult getting Place on the top!",1
Bus never showed up,"We gave up after waiting 1 hour for a bus to arrive, ended up taking a taxi. After buying tickets online we were told that the boat trips were fully booked for most of the day.",1
NOT RECOMMENDED!,"Not a good experience overall. We were staying right on the route at Puerto do Sol. The website mentioned this as a “waystop”. We bought tickets online and waited for the tram. When it arrived it drove thru without stopping. The driver signalled he can’t stop. The website doesn’t explain this.

We tried to get a regular 28 to the terminus for the tour but 2 were full. That was 45 minute already wasted waiting at the Puerto do Sol stop, so we took an Uber to the terminus.

At the terminus we were told the last tram of the day would leave in 25 minutes and it would only do 75% of the usual tour. It was 4:15pm and they say they run til 6:30ish I think. Disappointing when you’ve paid €100+ for tickets based on the very misleading web info.

When the tour started it was better than a usual tram 28 in that there were seats. There was also commentary in many languages but it didn’t seem at all aligned to where we were passing. Also it wasn’t at all interesting. Mostly just stating the obviously - what you could see out of the windows.

After Alfama the tour got very very dull. We ended up in some industrial areas. Not at all attractive. The tram then stopped for the night near the port and we were told to get off 15 minutes walk to the nearest tram stop to complete the loop back to where we’d started. It was probably very convenient for the driver. For all the passagers it was huge inconvenience.

I would NOT recommend this tram tour to anyone. It’s mostly very boring. It is hugely overpriced and the staff are happy to dump you miles from anywhere in a distant port at the end. Perhaps get Uber back if you get dumped at the port. The regular trams certainly aren’t a viable option.",1
Pior empresa!! Decepcionante!!,"PIOR experiência q tive! FUJAM da YELLOW BUS!!
A yellow bus simplesmente não tem ônibus, mais de uma hora de espera pra passar os !
Não respeitam horário, muito tempo perdido!
E ainda perdi o comboio de volta a Espinho por causa desses atrasos absurdos!!!",1
I Hopped Off Disappointed,"This is a very impersonal touring experience. I’ve done many city tours and the best parts of these tours in most cases are the guides, the stories they tell, and their personalities. This tour is prerecorded. Also, the bus is not air conditioned and can be very hot, like the day I toured.",2
AVOID THIS BUS TOUR!,One bus an hour.. “live updates” on website don’t work. Definitely not as advertised on the website as showing one bus every 20 minutes… DO NOT TAKE THIS BUS! Choose the red hop on hop off bus tours or Gray Line which seemed to be much more frequent! It was a waste of money that we barely got any use out of,1
Rude bus drivers,Very rude bus drivers! They don’t stop at all the bus stops. Not so complex route like the other companies. I highly recommended NOT to buy tickets at this company!,1
"Bus not stopping in main attraction, awful customer service","We waited more than 1h30 to get the bus at the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos to find out the bus was skipping this stop after calling the company. In the website we could see the scheduled time to arrive but it never did, while the buses from the other companies were stopping there. Customer service was awful, no refund was given after asking on the phone. Moreover the other companies buses are much more frequent than yellow bus. Do yourself a favor and use another company.",1
"Broken down buses, waste of money","The buses were broken down and I wasn't able to use the pass for any tour. We were shuffled back and forth several times between buses, but none of them were working or running tours. I have tried reaching out for a refund without success. I would not recommend this activity.",1
Disappointing experience,"My husband and I did the 48-hour Belem & Modern Lisbon tours. It seemed very convenient since the ticket price includes the funicular roads, the tram tour, and the Santa Justa lift. Unfortunately, when put into practice, I must admit that this value was my fantasy...

First of all, the stops for the buses are too scattered, which makes hopping on/off basically undoable due to the vast distance you need to cover to reach a bus stop. In the end, we ended up completing the routes without hopping off or on.

The commentary on the bus is very poor in content, and the audio system had some technical issues, causing hiccups and constant interruptions of sound.

Taking the tram is impossible! It does not allow hopping in; it starts and finishes at the same stop downtown. It can only fit a maximum of 24 people, and there is only one tram every 30 minutes. The queue is immense! So, in order to enjoy this route, you have to spend half a day queuing!

The Santa Justa Lift also has a long queue as there is only one functioning lift, and it comes down approximately once every 15 minutes. We spent about an hour queuing for a 1-minute ride. In my opinion, it is simply not worth it.

Overall, I would not recommend this experience; it was quite disappointing. I suggest you try other companies for hop-on-hop-off tours.",2
Very long waits at each stop.,"The buses absolutely do not run every 20 minutes as advertised. Plan to wait close to an hour at each stop. Do the red bus tour instead, there are many more of them. It got to the point where we were afraid to get off at the stops because we didn’t want to spend another hour standing around waiting at the bus stop.",1
Waste of money.,Unclear information about WHERE to pick up the bus. Even when we called to get info they said it’s there in that street. But no clear way to find info. Looked around for 15 mins to find it. Finally we flagged down the bus. The bus was in awful condition. Half of the ports to connect headsets to were not working. Driver had no idea. We informed them. They apparently reset it but the ports STILL didn’t work. Fewer seats on the bottom. Commentary was glitchy when it did work. I would NOT recommend this service. Maybe do the Red Hop on Hop off.,1
Rip off hop on bus trip,We paid €27 each for the hop on bus from Lisbon cruise terminal this morning. We were directed to the wrong bus having chosen the red line &;questioned this however were assured we were on the right bus. As soon as we moved off the commentary said we were on the blue line! The information then stopped with only music coming through the earpiece. Several people complained & we were told we could get off later & change buses. We travelled for 30 mins through rundown flats & shops with graffiti over most of the buildings. We eventually gave up and left the bus with no clue where we were. Funnily enough the desks selling the tickets at the cruise terminal had packed up when we're got back........ a complete waste of time & money. Be careful & ask questions before buying a ticket,1
Avoid the Yellow Bus Lisbon,We waited 45 minutes for a bus on the blue route. 1 hour on the red route. The brochure states the bus comes every 20 minutes. Not so. They cancel services without letting passengers know. The blue route is a complete waste of my time. Enjoyed the red route. The boat ride was great after we had to queue in the hot sun.Please choose the red bus company. More buses and better schedules.,1
Lisbon sunset cruise,"I never made the cruise because I couldn’t find the place to redeem our tickets . I put both address on the map . Gave it to my Uber driver, ask local people and nothing. We looked around for so long that we didn’t find the place in time to get the tickets and go to the dock. I called the number provided and the automatic system Kept hanging up and never connected me to a live person.",1
Pessimi,"Yellow bus... Pessimi!!!! Non date i vostri i soldi a questa gente non seria. Vi diranno che con il loro ticket potete prendere tutti i pullman e tram.... Non è così. Vi diranno che i tram in particolare il 28 ci sono fino all'una di notte... Non è così! Finiscono al massimo alle 23. Vi diranno che con Yellow bus potete andare in aeroporto... Casualità??? Fermata sospesa....
Sappiate che trattare così il turista avrete un breve futuro....
Quando arrivate a Lisbona, in aeroporto fate la Lisbona card e non sbagliate.",1
Esperienza terribile,"Una stella perché zero non si può! Esperienza orribile… siamo partiti da piazza figueira alla volta di belem. Aria condizionata assente (rotta? Spenta? Boh) 40 gradi all ombra. Da sentirsi male…
Probabilmente in altre stagioni si può fare, in estate assolutamente no.
Fa un giro con cui non si vede nulla della città. Abbiamo pagato l’audioguida ma non funzionavano le prese delle cuffie.
27€ sprecati, siamo tornati in taxi.
Consigliato invece il tram 28",1
Very poor experience,"Tour commentary rarely corresponded with sights. Stop numbers on map didn’t correspond with stops announced on bus. Driver impatient, didn’t give us enough time to get downstairs to the door, then wouldn’t let us off and snapped at us to sit down.",1
Go with Grey Line Tours Instead,"Do Not Use the Yellow Bus Tours!!! Not enough buses, poorly marked bus stops and app not working. The Grey Line Tours (Red Lisbon sightseeing bus), was so much better and I saw at least 2X to 3X as many buses. Their prices were the same and their drivers speak English.

Once on the bus, it was nice but the problem was trying to find the stops and what time the bus picked up or where it was. The app worked sporatically and I would have to close out and reopen at least 4-5 times to finally get it to work. At every stop, I would run into people who also had the same problem. We would have to work as a group to figure either where a stop was or how to get the app to work. None of the drivers spoke English so they could not help us.",2
Not worth the long bus wait times,"Unfortunately the bus consistently arrived at least 40 minutes after the scheduled stop times...I know the times for the stops aren't exact but waiting at least 40 minutes for a bus that is supposed to pass through the stops hourly is a problem... you will spend more time waiting for the bus than actually on the bus. On day one we actually waited nearly an hour past the scheduled stop time for the bus to appear at one stop before we called an Uber and just went home.

The oceanarium was great but since we were staying near there we just walked there before getting on the bus....The oceanarium wouldn't let us in since the tickets emailed to us first had to be validated by the bus and we then had to take those tickets to the aquarium... this wasn't explained on the website so we waited some more for a bus to validate our tickets so we could get into the Oceanarium.

The novelty of riding on the top of the double-decker bus is the only reason to book this but Lisbon is a city with so much traffic and traffic lights that you won't really get going fast enough to feel the wind in your hair, you will just sit up top and bake slowly in the sun. You are probably better off just grabbing an Uber to see the things you want to see and buying tickets to the Oceanarium on your own.

I would recommend their sunset boat cruise though, the staff was nice, the music was great, and the boat was on time :)",1
There’s better out there,"The description listed a number of snacks and drinks that would be available as complementary. For example, description said one coffee. No coffee was offered and that would’ve been nice because it started getting cold. The music was great and I really enjoyed that. Other than that, there’s definitely other better options out there. The only thing we got was some little pastry and a plastic champagne glass of either wine I think it was or Fanta. I personally wouldn’t do this again. I will try out one of the other numerous boat tours available.",2
Bad experience,"Whatever you do, do not use yellow bus. On multiple occasions we had to sit on a bus for 40-50 minutes either on the top in the sun, or on the bottom without A/C. During our last ride, the driver stopped at a stop and told us we had to get off the bus because the audio wasn’t working and another bus would come pick us up. We ended up walking the rest of the day because the tour was so atrocious, and did not match up with their promised timeline nor the “live timetables” they have online. I would recommend the Lisbon or Portugal sightseeing, as they were at each of the stops we were waiting at twice to three as many times as the yellow bus arrived.",1
Predatory Business Practices,"We bought a 72-hour tour package including the hop on hop off buses, tram and boat at 55 euros pp. Upon arriving to the bus for the first time, our bar code (on cell phone) was scanned, and we were given a receipt-like piece of paper (about 1.5” x 7”) that printed out of a handheld device to scan on the bus. Why you can’t just directly scan the bar code on your phone, I can’t imagine.
While at a shopping mall at the first stop where we “hopped off”, my husband lost this paper. The driver told us we had to have the paper to get back on. I showed him the original on my phone, and finally he allowed us to board, but only to return to the originating location. When we arrived, we spoke to the representative who told us they do not replace lost “tickets”, and we had to have the original to use the service. No interest in our confirmation email, proof of the 110 euros we paid, the original bar code, etc. They would NOT print another one. We were told we could call the office, but would be told the same.

Do yourself a favor and go with Grayline. It’s a well-known company that I’m sure wouldn’t pull this predatory crap. Or better yet, take a Tuk Tuk. We did exactly that.",1
Terrible service and ticket systems,First 2 buses we got on overheated and did not go anywhere. Had to buy tickets twice since there was an error in sending the first tickets bought online and their customer service offers 0 help.,1
Poor experience,Lots of technical issues spoiled the guide. Instruction did describe to device at each seat. Spoilt the experience to a large degree.,2
Lisbon by Yellow Bus - don't do it!,"Useless. No audio guide on the bus. The driver doesn't care, so the only way to make sense of what I'm seeing is by running Google Maps. Lousy.",1
Wouldn't recommend.,"The initial purchase screens are very unclear about which tour choices you can book. In most cities, you purchase a ticket, and you get access to all the tours and stops the map depicts. NOT in Lisbon! You have to purchase a ticket for either 'Modern Lisbon' or 'Belim'. Once you've purchased your online ticket, you then have to find the stops on the route in order to get on the bus. This is easier said than done as the stops are not marked on their PDF map. So if you walk/UBER to the start of the route it's a complete bun fight on a busy day as to which bus you're supposed to be on and once you discover that you have to deal with all the entitled queue jumpers who have free rein as the staff don't give a toss. Once on the bus the Belim tour is pretty good apart from the fact our driver ignored our requests to get off at our desired stop while also ignoring the frantic waves of a group on the footpath who wanted to get on. So much for 'hop on-hop off'! If you're going to do this, go with the red bus!",2
Yellow Bus city tours echt te mijden,"Ik vond Lissabon niet erg mooi. Maar dat kan de schuld zijn van de Yellow Bus Tours. Normaal moest die hop on hop off een opstapplaats hebben in de buurt van de Sete Rio bus terminal. Om een of andere reden was die weg, en niemand in de buurt wist waar je nu kon opstappen. Na veel rondvragen wist een chauffeur van een concurrerende maatschappij (Red Bus) waar hij dacht waar een opstap was. Zo ver van kant dat we er een taxi naartoe moesten nemen, niet goedkoop in het fileverkeer. Dan weer een heel eind mogen lopen om de precieze plem te vinden. Na meer dan een uur zaten we op de bus.Om naar een uiterst saaie audiocommentaar te luisteren. En dan moesten we onderweg nog uitstappen om met de metro naar de busterminal te rijden om zeker op tijd te zijn voor de bus terug. Alles bij mekaar heeft dat uitstapje naar Lissabon mijn vrouw en mij meer dan 100 euro gekost aan vervoer. Bedankt Yellow Bus en bedankt dat jullie er niet aan gedacht hebben om een kaartje met route en opstapplaatsen op internet te zetten of aan de klant te geven. Te moeilijk waarschijnlijk. Bereid maar een citytrip voor als je niet weet waar je moet afstappen om bijvoorbeeld een museum te bezoeken.",2
Pésima,"Pésima. Los autobuses lentos para que llegarán a la parada y a veces no paraban porque estaban llenos, no cumplían con los horarios pésima atención. En cambio los de la competencia no hacían sino pasar. No lo recomiendo en absoluto",1
PÉSSIMA EXPERIÊNCIA,"PÉSSIMA EXPERIÊNCIA!
Os ônibus demoram mais do que 20 minutos para passarem nas paradas. Estávamos na esperando já há um bom tempo, é mesmo após termos sinalizado, o ônibus não parou para nos buscar, passando direto. Resumindo, estamos há quase 40 minutos esperando para seguir o trajeto.",1
Disappointed,Disappointed. Location routes and drop offs weren't inspiring. Having stopped at the Oceanarium we expected to get the bus back to centre. It never showed up. We were 10 minutes early. The live stream of bus locations showed that it would take 50 minutes from timetable time. We got an Uber. We didn't bother using the Yellow Bus for next 2 days we'd paid for.,1
A disappointing experience,"This was disappointing. We waited 40 mins for the initial pickup - and 1 hour for the final pickup. During that hour, at least three red buses came and went. You just are not running enough buses",2
Zuviele Passagiere,"Bus war überfüllt und die Abstände der Busse sind sehr lang.
Steigt man bei einer Station aus dauert es sehr lange bis ein nächster Bus kommt.",2
Tour Lisbona moderna - pacco clamoroso!!,"Un ora e 45 min assolutamente sprecati, il tour tocca aree della città di interesse nullo. La maggior parte del tempo si ascolta solo musica portoghese (nulla da vedere e/o spiegare per km e km...). Quelle poche spiegazioni arrivano in audio troppo tardi, quando il monumento è già stato superato dal bus.
RISPARMIATE I VOSTRI SOLDI !!
Fatevi un giro sul tram 28 che ne vale davvero la pena. Utile anche il bus 759 che arriva fino al museo degli azuleos.",1
Vraiment médiocre et décevant,"Nous avions choisi l'option 48h pour les circuits bleu et rouge.
Les commentaires lors des circuits sont pauvres et parfois non synchrones avec les lieux.
Il n'y a pas de possibilité d'arrêt à chaque point d'intérêt même majeur.
Les stations d'arrêt et de reprise des circuits sont mal indiquées, les temps d'attente sont interminables pour la reprise d'un bus suivant (souvent plus d'une demi-heure).
Malgré tout, le circuit bleu ""Belem"" est assez intéressant par contre le circuit rouge ""Modern"" n'a d'intérêt que si on apprécie l'architecture moderne et futuriste des installations construites pour l'exposition universelle de 1998. Sinon, il longe les quais interminablement et s'avère sans intérêt.
Je pense qu'il est possible de trouver un meilleur prestataire pour ce genre de découverte.",2
Une expérience décevante,"J'ai acheté deux formules Circuit All-in One à 45€ ; soient 90€ pour les journées du 24, 25 et 26 avril 2023 correspondant à mon séjour à Lisbonne. Dès mon arrivée à l'aéroport je n'ai pas pu prendre l'aerobus prévu dans la formule puisque le service était suspendu. J'ai dû prendre le métro pour rejoindre mon lieu de résidence. Une fois sur place, il a été très compliqué d'accéder à un Yellow Bus et de convertir la réservation en billet en raison de modifications des trajets sur place. Ce n'est que le mardi 25 aux environs de 15h00 que j'ai enfin pu accéder au service et en raison de la Fête de la Liberté, la société Yellow Bus ne proposait qu'un seul circuit fermé avec l'impossibilité de descendre sauf à Belem pour prendre le Yellow Boat. Et le Mercredi, c'était une déception aussi puisque le tramway ne proposait également qu'un circuit fermé avec l'impossibilité de descendre à notre guise pour visiter la ville que nous n'avons vue que de loin.
J'ai tenté de joindre Tripadvisor sur place, mais impossible d'avoir au téléphone un interlocuteur s'exprimant en français. Pourtant, depuis que j'ai souscris à votre offre, j'ai reçu de nombreuses notifications et publicités de votre site préparant au séjour ! Mais je n'ai jamais été informée de toutes ces modifications de la formule.
C'est inadmissible ! Je suis très déçue de Tripadvisor et pense être en droit de réclamer une réparation pour touts ces préjudices subis.",2
Could not be more disappointed,"I never got to take the tour. They sold me a ticket online (25 euros) but then when I showed up to use it, they said that too many street were blocked, and that I should request a refund. This, after making me run around Lisbon for 2 hours to various stops where the streetcar/tram never came! And after waiting on hold for customer service for a good 20 minutes. And of course, they have not refunded me nor even bothered to answer my emailed request for a refund. Overall, a very disappointing experience.",1
No one will contact me,I put the wrong date in when I purchased the tickets and beg them by email and phone call to call me back to change the date and I never heard from anybody. So I never took this tour. It is very frustrating because I am out $70 and I cannot get anybody to call me back.,1
No commentary upstairs in any buses today.,"Commentary not working upstairs on any of the buses we used today. Drivers say nothing before people get on. They’re happy to take your money. Waste of money, wish we had used another company.",1
Russian language is cancelled,"1. Russian language was not available, although it is listed on the website, and on the instructions on the seat in the bus itself. Instead of Russian, there was an Asian language. Also my mother tried all the language options and was still
unable to find Russian.
My mom and her husband don’t speak English, and the audio guide in Russian was the only reason to buy a ticket. I called the support and the operator assured me that Russian language is supported and advised to ask the driver for help. The driver couldn't help. As a result, my mother and her husband did not even on to the second bus. Wasted money at all.
2. Very long lines on Praça da Figueira. Staying under the sun for two hours is dangerous.",2
Péssima assistência da empressa que vendeu os tickets neste aplicativo,"O passeio é bom, mas a empresa que vendeu os tickets não prestou boa assistência. Demorou para enviar os tickets por email, não disponibilizou tickets pelo aplicativo, não respondeu mensagem enviada pelo aplicativo.",2
Zero,"Mis à part le tram, nous avons attendu 1h à un arrêt et aucun bus n'est passé. Nous avons fait les visites par nos propres moyens",1
Confusing and not the best option,"The bus was a nice way to see the city, but finding any information about times and locations made it mostly impossible to take the tram or the boat. The information center is nowhere near anything . There were multiple timelines none of which seemed accurate-so we paid for the combo but didn't get to ride the boat or the tram which was a big waste of money.",2
Enttäuschend,"Öfters Busse fahren lassen. Wartezeit bis zu einer Stunde auf den nächsten Bus, wenn man an einer Station aussteigt. .
Die Roten Busse fahren viel häufiger. Sehr ärgerlich",2
Not as good,"Be careful when they scan the QR and do not throw away the ticket cuz you will need it to show every time you hop in, the lady who scan our QR did not tell us we have to use the tiket she gave us every single time we use the bus or tram or shuttle.",2
Genuinely terrible,Genuinely terrible experience. Half of the head phone points were broken and when we found one that worked the information imparted was next to useless. Lisbon has such a fantastic history and yet this was the best boring pointless commentary ever. Then the bus driver missed the only stop we wanted to get off at having endured an hour and a half of the most boring city tour we’ve done anywhere in the world. Don’t bother.,1
Tour to be avoided in Lisbon,"The tours start from the bottle of Edward v11 park .
Arrived at 11.50 am for noon tour .No signs to inform visitors where to buy tickets.Hat seller brought me to an attendant at a bus who sold me 2 tickets and said bus would arrive in 5/6 minutes ,joined the line .
20 minutes later I asked the same attendant when the bus would arrive ,she said 5 minutes .It did arrive in 5 minutes but we were not allowed Board .Temperature was 30 degrees.Finally we got on and tour started ( 30 minutes late )
The bus has a translation system that required earphones.No one offered theses and as the bus was moving it was not possible to go down stairs to get them.A lot of the translation units were not working anyway .
Tour takes 1 hour 45 minutes ,at least 35 minutes of which is stuck in traffic .
Staff were neither helpful or friendly.
All round a poor experience and a waste of time and money at €22 per person",1
ESCASA FRECUENCIA,me parece que la frecuencia de los buses es MUY ESCASA. Paradas no especificadas bien en la página web y la entrada a algunos monumentos no tenía descuento como decía ser.Mucho mejor la compañía city seeing,2
Sehr nicht zu empfehlen!!!,"Unpünktlich!
2,5 Stunden Wartezeit auf nächsten Bus!
Betriebsschluss 17:25?????
Kein Einstieg mehr gestattet um17:25??????
Kann man vergessen!!!
Lieber die roten Busse nehmen!",1
Kaum Infos und defekte Technik,"Auf den zwei Bustouren gab es spärliche Infos, wenn die Stecker in den Sitzen funktionierten. Enttäuschend!
Personal war einmal unfreundlich und einmal freundlich.
Ich würde wieder auf die Roten umsteigen.",2
Awful,"Awful tour. If I wanted to look at office blocks, I could do it on my own time. The audio didn’t sync with the tour and gave descriptions for buildings you couldn’t see. Waste of time and money.",1
Insatisfaction,"Attentes interminables aux stations (1 heure) pour un service soit-disant toutes les 10 minutes. Audio-guides défectueux. Circuits peu intéressants (rien à voir avec Porto avec la même société il y a 3 ans). Déception complète, et pourtant tarifs bien chers.",1
Only to listen music!,"We have used so far only the red busses (Berlin, Sevilla, Sydney, …) and thought we try the yellow ones now in Lisboa.
Summary: Disappointing! We took the modern and the Belem tour today. A lot of music instead of interesting infos. Furthermore the Audio interrupted frequently (not only on our seat and not a prob of the headset). One bus was very worn down the other ok.
The advantage of the Yellows is, that you have public transport (tram an busses, but not metro!). Let’s see how the boattrip will be tomorrow, but next time we will be back on the Red.",2
Not worth it,"I just did the Hop on Hop off bus without the river cruise. It's NOT worth it for the price we paid. To begin with, they didn't complete the route they said they'd do. Secondly, the commentary barely existed. Most of the time they just had music on between points of interest when there was plenty of time to tell us a more about Lisbon. At the points of interest, the commentary was always brief.",1
Absolutely awful experience,"Totally disorganised. Late at stops by 20 minutes plus and only 2 buses per hour. Chaos at the start letting people with no ticket on the bus rather than selling outside. They should learn how to do it from Barcelona who run a fantastic system with no delays, plenty of buses. Choose another bus tour company",1
Worst tour,"I have always done city tours using hop on/off tour buses whenever I visit a European City. I’ve done Rome and Barcelona and found both tours educational and enjoyable, however I can’t say the same for the yellow bus.

The representative was rude, the tour disorganised and boring, and to top it off I had to pay for a second ticket as I mislaid the first one, (the “ticket” is similar to a debit/credit card receipt).

I really don’t understand why this organisation is unable to issue a proper ticket, e.g a card, an arm band or etc, but it may be their strategy to try to bleed the tourist as we all know things will get lost on holidays.

I will never use this company again or recommend anyone to do so.",2
не советую,"единственный плюс- это трамвайчик,который провёз по старому городу.Тур на автобусе не понравился. Один раз автобус проехал мимо остановки 13,даже не завернул к нам,нас было 4 человека. Следующий автобус мы ждали ещё пол часа. в итоге мы отстояли целый час. Было солнечно и мы стояли под солнцем.Это было ужасно! Маршрут по современному Лиссабону очень длинный и не понравился.Хотели выйти ,нажали кнопку стоп,но нам так и не остановили.",2
"deludente, e sconsigliato","giro che doveva essere di 2 ore, eseguito in un ora e 15 minuti,pagando ben 25 euro a persona, guidato male,neanche fermato 1.minuto per fare qualche foto, l autista passava au marciapiedi , il bus sobbalzava, un esperienza deludente da nn fare più ÷ sconsiglio di pagare 25 euro per 1.ora o poco più su BUS tenuti male,rotti con un audio pessimo",1
Just go on the Red bus tour,"The pick up points are not clear. We wanted to get on at Eduardo Park and waited for 1 hour at the bus stop at the bottom of the park. It did not show so we booked a red bus tour. Apparently the yellow bus goes to the top of the park but we did not see any yellow buses and only saw one while out on the red bus tour. There are at least 3 red buses always parked up at the park.
We have been unable to get a refund from the yellow bus, despite there guarantee 😳 this is because they do not reply to emails or answer the phone",1
Yellows Bus Lisbonne bof,"Très mauvaise expérience avec Yellow Bus de Lisbonne
. Les deux chauffeurs que nous avons eu ont été désagréables
. Le parcours n'est pas toujours très intéressant et à plusieurs occasions nous passons au même endroit
. Les commentaires sont pas très intéressants
Enfin préférez les Bus Rouges aux Bus Jaunes",1
Check all the facts and other options first.,"Having used the service we would not recommend it. The tours run in one direction so if you want to use the blue line for only a few stops you have to repeat the entire trip from your initial starting point each time. Not very flexible. The last pickups of the day end around supper hour so don’t plan to use it after staying out any distance from your accommodation to enjoy an evening meal.

The stops are not called out so you have to guess where you are before signalling you would like to disembark. The blue line runs approximately every 30 minutes so if you do disembark your choices for continuing the tour are limited. Miss a bus because it arrives a bit early, another 30 minute wait.

Some stops are a great distance apart and if you choose to walk to the next one, good luck finding some small yellow placards indicating a stop. Unsure why they cannot make safe stops in a few more of the city bus stands?

We were less than 100 yards from a posted stop on a side street with little traffic near the port and signalled to the driver. She pointed behind her bus as she passing. Disappointing.

Investigate your alternatives. Maybe good for a single day trip once round the city. Just stay on the bus.",2
Nul,"Nous avons acheté des billets valables 48h.
Sauf qu’après avoir utilisé le QR code, le chauffeur lors de notre 1ere montée dans le bus était censé nous donner le ticket correspondant à notre achat.
Sauf qu’il ne nous a rien donné du tout. A ce moment là nous ne savions pas que le QR code n’était en fait qu’une contremarque.
Résultat le deuxième jour nous n’avons pas pu utiliser le bus!
J’ai expliqué mon problème au chauffeur de bus le 2eme jour et il ne m’a pas cru donc accès au bus refusé.",1
Never again,At first instance the all-in one an optimised combination of hip-on hop-off bus + Tramway + Cruise. Thé tramway is difficult to find and the cruise is only available on specific days. I should have opted for the red competitor which offers several and frequent circuits,2
una sola parola: sconsigliato,"Mi chiedo come possano essere operativi avendo un'addetta così scortese.
Prezi al bar del traghetto osceni (16 euro per uno spritz che mi sono ben guardato dal comprare) e pulizia approssimativa.",2
Loop around Lisbon,Fine if you want a loop around Lisbon but no warning of stops when to get off or on. Audio quality good but not not much information given. 25 quid isn't that expensive for 48 hours but warnings of stops should be given.,2
Ruim,"Audio terrivel!!
It's not a good choice. The bus stopped several times to try to fix it but at the end the problem wasn't solve.",1
Dreadful,"The bus does not give any indication of times of pick up / drop off, the main location is easily found but the other bus stops are not easy to locate, this tour only included the Belem Tower and the Basilica , the rest of the tour was just around the city ! Taking taxi or tram would be better",2
"Busse kommen selten, nicht zu den geplanten Uhrzeiten und die Haltestellen sind kaum zu finden weil nicht beschildert.","Der Bus fährt viel zu selten und hält sich nicht an die geplanten Uhrzeiten. Die Haltestellen sind nicht zu finden, wir haben den ganzen Tag gestresst Haltestellen gesucht und ewig auf Busse gewartet. Es gibt keine ordentliche Beschilderung der Haltestellen. In der Regel auch keine Möglichkeit sich beim warte zu setzen.",2
Don’t use imho,"We bought a 4 day ticket online. No where on the webpage does it say that in the winter there is only 1 bus an hour. That’s not a hop on hop off. The commentary is very poor, they talk about some things far too late or not at all. We have used Red Bus tours in other cities that are so much better. The tram was a waste of time, people always pushing in. 1 hour wait then packed full, really others we spoke to were also very disappointed. The boat trip was also not very good with a loud speaker commentary in 4 languages that was very limited and difficult to hear.
Please understand I’m happy to give a good review just not this time. Also you receive a QR code by email but this is scanned and you get a ticket for 2 people. My wife wanted to use the bus but I had the ticket, the email was no good and the driver rude.
If you do still decide to book do individual bookings as they are so cheap nothing will change.",2
Very disappointing,"Better, clearer maps showing stop numbers and features clearly.
Announcements of stops and what they are with plenty of warning.",1
Not as great as expected,"The bus came a little over every hour so I didn’t get to explore the way I anticipated and the last run is at 5p, although website & brochure says 7p",2
no vuelvo a cogerlo,"Pesima. A parte de que hay que e4sperar lo indecible para que llegue el bus,que viene lleno de gente y no hay donde sentarse o no te puedes subir.
En nuestro caso en concreto subimos a uno y sin decirnos nada como iba mal de tiempo se salto varias paradas y nos quedo una parte de lisboa sin recorrer la cual tuvimos que ir despues nosotros por otros medios de transporte",1
Terrible organisation of the tour,"It was terrible organisation of the tour. On the Departure point nobody from organizers is not present and people didn't understand how the tour should be.
I booked tour at 11:30 and i was staying in the queue more than 2 hours. Earphones and audio guide weren't provided to me. I wasted money and time.
I have very bad experience with Yellow Bus organization.",1
Pruebe mejor usar el Rojo,"El recorrido azul, que lo utilizamos dos veces, mala predisposición de los choferes, varios audios no funcionaban, los horarios un desastre, o pasaban antes y no esperaban al horario exacto ( como suele hacerse en todos los lugares del
Mundo si se adelanta) o llegaban tarde. En la torre de Belem el jueves 5 el de las 15.05 llegó 15.20, y el siguiente se adelantó. Ni una disculpa o solución lógica. Conclusión en uno la gente apiñada, gente parada por todos lados, el otro vacío. Luego utilizamos el recorrido morado, aquí el conductor fue muy amable, y los horarios mejor. Pero de volver probaría con la línea de autobuses rojos, que se veía tenían el doble de frecuencia. Ah, y si logran mejorar el servicio, un aviso previo a cada parada, sería bueno, ya que evidentemente uno no conoce el lugar. saludos",2
Falta de respeto a los clientes,Nunca respetaron horarios en las paradas. Se van antes de la hora prevista o aparecen tarde (hasta 20 minutos) . El otro hop on hop off sightseeing Lisboa (red bus) tiene mas frecuencias y mejor puntualidaf,2
Never again,Absolutely awful! It doesn’t cost so much. It’s just like regular 28 rout but with very poor and strange audio guide. And! Tram came later in !!!2!!! Hours because of private tour. Never!,1
Accès aux autobus Carris/Lisbonne refusé,"Nous avons pris le pack complet, 3 jours, pour visiter Lisbonne. Tout s'est très bien passé les 2 premiers jours. Mais, surprise, le 3eme jour : par deux fois, l'accès aux bus ""Carris"" nous a été refusé, nous avons dû acheter des billets pour monter dans ces bus. Le second chauffeur était à la limite de l'agressivité.",2
Not worth for money,"We went during new year time, although it sounds a lot can be covered with free tram ride funiculars ride it’s not practical to cover them during holiday seasons as the roads in Lisbon is super busy.
we found the bus was never on time as suggested by schedule so lot of time is wasted.

Probably best to use local bus and metro passes which cover funicular tram 28 and metros.",2
Very poor communication and hidden expenses,"Based on other reviews, maybe we were extremely unlucky, but our experience was so bad, I am compelled to forewarn others considering this company. The booking confirmation provided no instructions about the need to purchase all entrance tickets online prior to departure. As a result, we missed out on the main attraction (Pena Palace). Further, this is an extremely rushed tour. We had a maximum of one hour at each stop, and did not see much of them. Then, perhaps worst of all, the lunch stop was at a very expensive restaurant. Like 50 euros and up per person! We did not wish to spend so much and were given no choice about it. After complaining, the company offered nothing to make up for this lousy experience. Will never book with this company again. FYI, the brochure does not mention the expensive lunch nor other surprises like paying for shuttle buses to sites.",1
This tour sucks,"This tour sucks. On the brochure is pictured three Sintra palaces; we stopped at one. Our guide did not even go with us into the Pena Palace as promised. Instead we spent 90 minutes in Cascais, and this is not worth the time. Our guide was knowledgable, but this tour was not as expected, and instead of having a private guide, our guide waited for us at the end. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL>. STAY AWAY.",1
Bad.,"I'll never go to this studio again. I suffered prejudice from the employee Valentina in the presence of the employee Pedro, who at some times tried to harmonize the situation to resolve it in a better way. But still, the situation was and prejudice and very unfinished.

I was approached in a embarrassing way in space and was compelled to have a conversation at the studio reception that I had no interest in, even having said it by email and personally the same day.

Purchase promotional passes, as any other customer has the right to purchase, regardless of the amount that the customer pays, whether he 1 euro, 49 or 100 euro, or no euro.

I received an offer of a voucher after answering a questionnaire sent by the studio available to all people. I was informed by email that I would have 7 days free access to the studio. After receiving the email, the employees made a mess, questioning the truthfulness of my part about the voucher. Faced with this first virtual embarrassment, I said, by email, that I no longer had an interest in receiving the voucher.

They tried to ""fix"" the situation and released the voucher in the app. As I very much like the teachers, which as a sign I indicate almost everyone, I decided to disregard such confusion by email, and marked the way to the studio.

Arriving there, just before the scheduled class, the above-mentioned employee in the presence of the other employee approached me and generated a very boring and embarrassing situation. I was forced to show my email on my phone, as if lying, and after that, I still suffered class prejudice, with her saying at every moment that I had only paid a discovery pass and ""free classes"", and I had already bought other promotions in the low-cost studio.

Obviously I left and I'm never going back to the studio.

Disappointing,"We were there several times during the stated opening hours, but unfortunately it was closed. There was also no information on the door about when it would reopen. It was a shame, we went there specifically because of the positive reviews. And from the outside it actually looked exciting.",2
A waste of money and time,"We looked for over 1 hour to pick up the information. We were helped by hotel staff, a security person and a waiter and were still not able to connect. They did not give us a working phone number to call to get the information. Don’t waste your money!",1
And don't give me an answer to an offer I have,"The company no longer exists. On all sites place the address on the Walk of the Star, 100 but does not exist. And they don't give an answer to solve the matter... I have a 365 day offer and no one solves it.",1
Not worth the privatectoyr,The driver tour guide was below par. He suggested places not to miss but didn’t include them in the afternoon’s list. He was in a hurry to end his 4 hours. Some places could only be viewed outside. We didn’t complete the list but chose instead to get off at the museum of carriages.,2
Joke!,A 4 star hotel in PORTUGAL that doesn’t serve alcohol! What a fjoke!,1
Useless,Let us down at airport cos pp controll took 2hours let us down on pick up going backto airport home fobbed us off the taxi was coming then told us driver not able to come ..I don't want a refund ....they would not give us one on our arrival for delay in ppcontroll ..I want a reliable service ...there taking your money and not providing a service ..useless rubbish company AVOID AVOID AVOID .THIS WAS IN PORTUGAL ...,1
Delusional driving,"We regret to say that the guide Gabriel
Very present I dare, he told us all his life, speaking badly of the agency where he had just worked and forgot to tell us the story of Sintra and the fifth from Regaleira. In fact, he told us that at the Quinta da Regaleira they did the macumba rites! We advise the company Zoom travel to choose their staff better ! Disappointing! Less bullshit we're old but not dumb",1
